"Dissidents Silenced, GOP Convention Turns Attacks on Clinton; Move by some delegates to change convention rules highlights the divisions within the party","  CLEVELAND--On the first night of Donald Trump's convention, Republicans assailed Hillary Clinton for the 2012 attack on Benghazi, illegal immigration and recent killings of police officers they said were the result of societal breakdowns caused by feckless leadership in Washington. [...]Mr. Trump's campaign and its Republican National Committee allies presided over the most chaotic scene at a national party convention in generations, with hundreds of delegates shouting for a roll-call vote to disrupt his forthcoming nomination and one state delegation walking off the floor.",1805168946,Newspapers," Epstein, Reid J

What Uber Can Teach the Fed,"  Without the production of real assets, there's no credit. Because the Fed doesn't produce anything but the medium -- albeit a medium that is government-backed -- the Fed's credit-rigging efforts are tangential, not comprehensive. Part of ""Who Needs the Fed?"" is devoted to how the author's definition of credit applies to the modern economy.

The Art of the Presidential Deal,"  Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination in Cleveland Thursday, and he is a figure without precedent in modern U.S. politics. [...]even in his unlikely hour of triumph, the polls show that independents and many Republicans are still ambivalent or undecided voters. The businessman's convictions on public matters are elusive; he is an unreliable guide to his own program, which can change from day to day; and to the extent he has a guiding ideology it is an invincible conviction in his own instincts, business ability and understanding of human nature.",1806008186,Newspapers," Anonymous

The Terrorist Past Has a Message for the Terrorist Present,"  In the past 19 months, France has seen the attack on the newspaper Charlie Hebdo (17 deaths); the coordinated attacks in Paris (130); a cargo-truck attack in Nice (84); and this week a hostage-taking and murder of an elderly parish priest in the small town of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray. Since July 18, Germany has seen at least three smaller-scale attacks: A Pakistani refugee injured five people with an ax on a train; an Iranian-German teenager shot nine people dead in Munich; a Syrian refugee tried to set off a bomb at a concert in Ansbach, killing himself. High-profile attacks included the bombing of a Pan Am aircraft over Lockerbie in 1988 (270 dead); attacks on airports in Rome and Vienna in 1985 (19); the Bologna railroad station bombing in 1980 (85); and the attack on the 1972 Munich Olympics (12 dead, excluding the terrorists).",1807218524,Newspapers," Boot, Max

Why Hillary Should Fear Optimism,"  Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., President Obama and the nominee herself all welcomed conservatives and moderates with misgivings about Mr. Trump to find a new home in the Democratic Party -- or at least, as Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, urged, to stay long enough to vote for Mrs. Clinton. Democrats tried to portray Mrs. Clinton simultaneously as a true progressive and a nonpartisan unifier. Because each nominee has intraparty opponents, each nominee sees a chance to court the people who lost the other side's primary.",1807733186,Newspapers," Ponnuru, Ramesh

Will Donald Trump channel Jesse Ventura's Minnesota magic?,"  In a widely circulated essay published recently on various websites, liberal film documentarian Michael Moore offered ""The Jesse Ventura Effect"" as one of the reasons he believes Trump will beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in November and become our next president. Because of ""the anger that so many have toward a broken political system, millions are going to vote for Trump not because they agree with him, not because they like his bigotry or ego, but just because they can,"" he wrote. Conventional wisdom If major-party political conventions make a difference anymore, and I'm not sure they do, then the Democrats will emerge from the recently concluded back-to-back infomercials with a healthy advantage.",1807741149,Newspapers," Zorn, Eric

Fairfax targets drivers with out-of-state plates,"  Virginia's largest jurisdiction is cracking down on local residents and businesses whose cars are registered out of state - a problem that officials attribute to the commonwealth's property tax on cars and its refusal to issue driver's licenses to immigrants in the country illegally. Since July 2015, Fairfax officials have identified 2,300 incorrectly registered vehicles - 742 with Maryland plates - and recovered about $600,000 in unpaid vehicle property taxes. State Sen. Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax), whose district in eastern Fairfax County and portions of Prince William County has a large immigrant population, said constituents have told him that they go to Maryland to obtain driver's licenses and state identification.",1807841473,Newspapers," Olivo, Antonio

"Community Reels After Killing of Imam --- Neighbors, activists see religious bias in crime, but police don't have any evidence for that","  The 55-year-old Queens imam fatally shot over the weekend was, like many of his neighbors in Ozone Park, an immigrant from Bangladesh committed to making a new life in the U.S. Now plans are being made for sending Maulama Akonjee's body home after what a law-enforcement official said may have been a targeted assault on him and a friend Saturday following a prayer service at a mosque where Mr. Akonjee was a regular speaker. Activist groups sued the NYPD after the Associated Press reported in 2011 that intelligence-unit officers infiltrated mosques and student groups in New York and New Jersey in what critics saw as racial and religious profiling.",1811263823,Newspapers," Morales, Mark

Brexit could sting bees in unique ways,"  At stake are the future of European regulations of pesticides that could threaten the 250,000 hives on this island nation; medicines that can be used to treat honeybee ailments; and funding for inspectors responsible for ensuring the health of Britain's bees. Bees are a critical pollinator of Europe's farm crops, and their indirect impact on agriculture is estimated to be 22 billion euros, dwarfing the sales of honey.",1812588874,Newspapers," Mui, Ylan Q

The incident at the Santa Ana polls came six years after the Republican National Committee began operating under a consent decree, which was handed down by the Supreme Court and prevents the party from engaging in some voter-fraud prevention efforts without court approval.",1812589173,Newspapers," Lee, Kurtis

Brexit could sting bees in unique ways,"  At stake are the future of European regulations of pesticides that could threaten the 250,000 hives on this island nation; medicines that can be used to treat honeybee ailments; and funding for inspectors responsible for ensuring the health of Britain's bees. Bees are a critical pollinator of Europe's farm crops, and their indirect impact on agriculture is estimated to be 22 billion euros, dwarfing the sales of honey.",1812675646,Newspapers," Mui, Ylan Q

Chicago SNAP fraud 'fairly rampant',"  Sami Deffala, who's managed a corner store in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood for 13 years, said he hears that every day from customers vying for a private moment in hopes of using their Link cards to exchange SNAP benefits, the modern-day version of food stamps, for cash -- an illegal practice called trafficking by federal regulators. The temptation proves too great for some retailers. Since October 2014, more than 140 stores in Chicago and 34 in suburban Cook County have been permanently disqualified from the $75 billion federal food stamps program, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",1812678140,Newspapers," Trotter, Greg

[...]not one of those ideas -- his extreme brand of protectionism, his call to re-examine military alliances, his threat of mass deportations -- shows any sign of becoming Republican dogma the way that supply-side economics did in the wake of Ronald Reagan's evangelism for it.",1814433666,Newspapers," Bruni, Frank

According to the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a think tank that focuses on the American Muslim community, the number of Muslims registered to vote lags behind that of other faith traditions as well as the general population.",1814868931,Newspapers," Pashman, Manya Brachear

[...]although he rejected any possible path to legal status - or ""amnesty"" - during that speech, he suggested Thursday during an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham that he would revisit legalization after his border security policies were enacted.",1815886593,Newspapers," DelReal, Jose A

Getting America Back In Gear,"  John Plumb, who's challenging my own congressman, the Trump supporter and Tea Party Republican Tom Reed, might consider an ad like the following: ""In a briefing on nuclear weapons with a foreign policy expert, Donald Trump repeatedly asked, 'If we have them, why can't we use them?' Tom Reed wants to entrust this man with the nuclear codes."" An actual ad emphasizing the lack of daylight between her opponent's positions and those of Mr. Trump, made by LuAnn Bennett, who is challenging Barbara Comstock, a Republican in Virginia's 10th District, further illustrates Mr. Trump's potential to haunt down-ballot candidates. Since many potentially vulnerable Republican congressional seats are in safely blue states like California and New York, a serious effort to end Republican majorities would of course require expenditures that will have no impact on the Electoral College vote.",1816411948,Newspapers," Frank, Robert H

Did Trump's ascent beget more bigots?,"  On Sunday, my column was about a comment from the head of Latinos for Trump, who warned that if we don't do something about immigration, we're going to end up with -- horror of all horrors -- taco trucks on every corner. ""Because it would be an eyesore and this is not Tijuana -- yet,"" a reader responded. Some readers missed the point altogether, scolding me about the impact of food trucks on brick-and-mortar restaurants (OK, a legitimate concern but a different column), or arguing that more trucks means more low-wage jobs (then leave a bigger tip), or making cracks about food poisoning (sprinkle some lime on your taco and take a walk on the wild side).",1817031228,Newspapers," Lopez, Steve

The 9th Circuit is a flower child no longer; The next president could have an outsized effect on a court famous for its liberal bent.,"  In 2011, when the Supreme Court once more reversed the 9th Circuit on a capital punishment case, it accused the appeals court of exhibiting ""judicial disregard"" for ""sound and established principles"" of law -- which is about as catty as it gets in the marbled hallways of the federal appellate judiciary. Former prosecutor Jacqueline Nguyen, for example, wrote an opinion approving Royal Dutch Shell's oil-drilling plan off the coast of Alaska against a challenge by environmental groups under the Endangered Species Act, and over a dissent from Carter appointee Dorothy Nelson.",1818132068,Newspapers," Feuer, Ben

The Paranoid Style in American Politics Is Back,"  First and foremost, the anticipation of such a defeat has released in the Trump camp what the historian Richard Hofstadter famously described in 1964 as ""The Paranoid Style in American Politics"": In fact, the idea of the paranoid style as a force in politics would have little contemporary relevance or historical value if it were applied only to men with profoundly disturbed minds. In early August, a Bloomberg poll asked voters, ""When it comes to the presidential election, is it your sense the election will or will not be rigged?"" The poll found that 56 percent of Trump supporters believed the election would be rigged.",1818132250,Newspapers," Edsall, Thomas B
