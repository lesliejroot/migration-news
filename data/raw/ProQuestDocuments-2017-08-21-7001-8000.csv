Don't look for the trend to last. The labor-force participation rate, which stood at 66% on the eve of the recession, is a closely watched measure of the economy's vitality. Its long slump to a 38-year low of 62.4% last fall became a potent symbol of the incomplete recovery and a sign that actual joblessness may be worse than the official unemployment rate suggests. Now the strongest run of hiring since the end of the 1990s is drawing would-be job seekers off the sidelines, pushing the rate steadily up since September. It hit 62.9% in February. But forces independent of the business cycle are exerting downward pressure, with the wave of baby-boomer retirements topping the list. The rate may keep climbing in the short term, but many economists believe it will resume its decline soon enough.",1770814987,Newspapers," Leubsdorf, BenBenBen LeubsdorfLeubsdorfBen Leubsdorf , Leubsdorf, BenBenBen LeubsdorfLeubsdorfBen Leubsdorf",,," (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
