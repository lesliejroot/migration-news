"In lawsuit, wine bar says Trump's D.C. hotel has illegal edge","Eric Trump called the lawsuit ""a publicity stunt"" in an interview Thursday afternoon after a promotional event for the Senior PGA Championship, the golf tournament he will host in Loudoun County in May.The complaint cites Trump's appearances at the hotel, its hosting of foreign diplomats and White House press secretary Sean Spicer's comments saying, shortly before the inauguration: ""It's an absolutely stunning hotel.A man chasing fake news accounts fired a shotgun in Comet Ping Pong pizzeria a month after the election, while the owners of Maggiano's Little Italy apologized for inadvertently hosting a dinner in November sponsored by the National Policy Institute, a think tank that promotes white-nationalist ideologies.Paul F. Rothstein, a professor at Georgetown University's law school, said that when the Supreme Court allowed a sexual harassment suit to proceed against President Bill Clinton in 1997, it opened the door to other litigation against sitting presidents.",1875648477,Newspapers," O'Connell, Jonathan

"Trump template resonates in N.J., Va.","The former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member best known for his impersonation of Frank Sinatra is ""very close"" to jumping into the New Jersey governor's race, inspired in part by his interactions with ""real Americans"" while on the campaign trail with Trump. Piscopo's possible bid reflects the maneuvering in New Jersey and Virginia - the two states with gubernatorial contests this year - by candidates from both parties, who are trying to capitalize on lessons learned from Trump's strong performance among working-class voters. Several Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia have taken on the mantle of issues championed by Sanders, such as raising the minimum wage to $15, making public colleges and universities free, and moving to a single-payer health-care system. Despite sagging job approval numbers nationally, Trump remains popular among the Republican base, so there's an incentive, analysts say, to play up similarities during competitive GOP primaries. New Jersey Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno (R), who is seeking to succeed Christie, made no mention of Trump during a forum here hosted by a commercial real estate development association. Murphy has hardly ceded the progressive label to his challengers, pushing several issues that were part of Sanders's platform, including a $15...",1875986881,Newspapers," Wagner, John

Gaining freedom - for a price,"In exchange for their freedom, immigrants sign contracts promising to pay Libre $420 per month while wearing the company's GPS devices.After he surrendered to Border Patrol agents in Texas and asked for asylum, ICE sent him to the Northwest Detention Center, a cavernous facility for detained immigrants in Tacoma, and set his bond at $7,500.An unprecedented immigration court backlog of more than 540,000 cases, fueled by the Central American refugee crisis and coupled with soaring immigration bond prices, means that many detainees eligible for bail choose between spending many months behind bars or paying Libre's fees. ""There is a devil behind the door to liberation,"" said Paromita Shah, associate director at the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, an immigration rights group.Two lawsuits in California, including a class-action complaint filed last month, could bring new attention to the company's business practices and the control it wields over the lives of its clients.Jesus Escobar-Villalta, a 22-year-old asylum seeker from Honduras, said his GPS device began to bite into his ankle not long after his release from ICE custody.The company said in an email that its device was not to blame for his hospitalization and that ""if the client's hospital bill wasn't paid, it was because we never received a copy.""In Trump's capital, undocumented immigrants live and work in the shadow of the White House Rustic Camp David may be doomed with Trump as president Bill Dean throws wild Georgetown parties.",1875988177,Newspapers," Miller, Michael E

"U.S. economy sees jobs spike of 235,0, report says","Unemployment drops to 4.7% in February; Fed is expected to raise rates The U.S. economy added a healthy 235,000 jobs in February, according to government data released Friday morning, surpassing economists' expectations and likely clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this month. The release of February's unemployment data was widely seen as the final hurdle before the Federal Reserve's meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, when the central bank is expected to announce a quarter-point increase in its benchmark interest rate. Trump's ambitious pledges to slash corporate taxes, cut regulations and boost spending on infrastructure have helped push stock markets to record highs in recent weeks. Yet some economists question whether other pledges - such as a federal workforce hiring freeze, a reduction in immigration and a more combative attitude toward international trade - could ultimately weigh on growth.

"As crises mount for U.N. chief, so do obstacles","[...]the world body's biggest donor, the United States, has a new government that is much more skeptical of foreign aid.Many people inside and outside the United Nations saw Guterres's predecessor, Ban Ki-moon, as reluctant to raise issues that might lead to tensions with world powers or implicate the United Nations.Akshaya Kumar, the deputy U.N. director at Human Rights Watch, said that Guterres ""has a responsibility to push the council to talk about things they are not ready to talk about,"" including human rights violations in Burma and the conflict in Yemen, where a U.S.-backed coalition led by Saudi Arabia is battling rebels.Guterres has come in for some criticism for his handling of the European refugee crisis that erupted in 2015, with aid groups and former U.N. officials saying his agency did not do enough to push for the resettlement of people fleeing war.The new U.N. leader has announced ambitious goals - streamlining the organization's bureaucracy, improving peacekeeping operations and focusing more on preventing conflict civilians, he said.In 1994, campaigning for prime minister, he described himself as a man of compassion, but his sharp debating skills earned him the nickname of the ""talking pickax."" ""Some of his students had no idea that their teacher was the former prime minister,"" said Antonio Vitorino, his former deputy prime minister.",1875989155,Newspapers," Sieff, Kevin

"After Circling Warily, Trump and Merkel Prepare for a Meeting at the White House","Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel are poles apart on issues like immigration and trade; they have circled each other warily since the American presidential election. When Mr. Trump first announced his temporary travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries in January, Ms. Merkel patiently explained to him over the phone that the Geneva Conventions oblige countries to protect refugees of war on humanitarian grounds. In their briefing on Friday, White House officials said they expected a ""robust"" exchange between Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel on issues ranging from the European Union and the financing of NATO to trade and the campaign against the Islamic State. Hard-line ideological players, like Mr. Navarro and the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, vie with more conventional, realist ones, like Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser. On Friday, another senior administration official who did not want to be identified conceded that point, saying that any new trade deal with Germany would have to be negotiated with the European Union. Questions about link between Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and Russia continue to hang over him, while Ms. Merkel is preparing...",1875999701,Newspapers," Landler, Mark

TELEVISION REVIEW; Hard truths unfold; Modern slavery in its 'American' forms makes a potent narrative,"The family that runs the tomato farm has turned a blind eye to the inhumane practices carried out by its managers but has indirectly encouraged the poor treatment of pickers by continually cutting the bottom line in order to stay competitive. In addition to the farm story line, we meet several other characters in the first half of the series, including Kimara Walters (Regina King), a social worker who counsels teen prostitutes caught up in trafficking rings. Along the way, the eight-episode series folds in scenarios about a woman's right to choose, the toll corporate greed has taken on the lower economic rungs of society and how drug problems are perceived and discussed when they occur in the suburbs versus the inner city. [...]King's Kimara is supposed to be a veteran social worker but seems to be plodding through difficult situations for the first time, treading lightly in her effort to get troubled young people off the streets and into shelters and rehab programs. Creator Ridley makes a quick appearance in the first half of the series as a farm worker rights advocate, speaking at a meeting to raise awareness.

"THE NATION; New sheriff tackles an old debate; Arizonans elected him as the anti-Arpaio, but he's walking a careful line on immigration.","Arizona's most populous county has been home to some of the nation's most spectacular clashes over the duties of police officers when it comes to immigrants, but those who imagined a white knight riding into the Sheriff's Office and vanquishing Arpaio's controversial legacy with a stroke of his pen are sure to be disappointed with Penzone's measured approach. A Democrat elected with 56% of the vote in November, Penzone, 49, got his first job in law enforcement as a Phoenix police officer, rising within the organization to the rank of sergeant, where he ran the department's program for anonymous tips. After narrowly losing to Arpaio in 2012, Penzone campaigned last year by attacking the department's shortcomings, highlighting investigations that found the Sheriff's Office had failed to investigate more than 400 reports of sex crimes. Penzone, as a former police officer who worked with anonymous witnesses, says his greatest fear is missing crimes because members of the Latino community are too afraid to call the Sheriff's Office, much less file a complaint with their names attached. Within his first 60 days, Penzone has said, he aims to bring the Sheriff's Office into line with modern-day law enforcement practices that Arpaio rejected,...",1876000440,Newspapers," Duara, Nigel

"As crises mount for U.N. chief, so do obstacles","[...]the world body's biggest donor, the United States, has a new government that is much more skeptical of foreign aid.Many people inside and outside the United Nations saw Guterres's predecessor, Ban Ki-moon, as reluctant to raise issues that might lead to tensions with world powers or implicate the United Nations.Akshaya Kumar, the deputy U.N. director at Human Rights Watch, said that Guterres ""has a responsibility to push the council to talk about things they are not ready to talk about,"" including human rights violations in Burma and the conflict in Yemen, where a U.S.-backed coalition led by Saudi Arabia is battling rebels.Guterres has come in for some criticism for his handling of the European refugee crisis that erupted in 2015, with aid groups and former U.N. officials saying his agency did not do enough to push for the resettlement of people fleeing war.The new U.N. leader has announced ambitious goals - streamlining the organization's bureaucracy, improving peacekeeping operations and focusing more on preventing conflict before civilians, he said.In 1994, campaigning for prime minister, he described himself as a man of compassion, but his sharp debating skills earned him the nickname of the ""talking pickax.""

"Trump template resonates in N.J., Va.","The former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member best known for his impersonation of Frank Sinatra is ""very close"" to jumping into the New Jersey governor's race, inspired in part by his interactions with ""real Americans"" while on the campaign trail with Trump. Piscopo's possible bid reflects the maneuvering in New Jersey and Virginia - the two states with gubernatorial contests this year - by candidates from both parties, who are trying to capitalize on lessons learned from Trump's strong performance among working-class voters. Several Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia have taken on the mantle of issues championed by Sanders, such as raising the minimum wage to $15, making public colleges and universities free, and moving to a single-payer health-care system. Despite sagging job approval numbers nationally, Trump remains popular among the Republican base, so there's an incentive, analysts say, to play up similarities during competitive GOP primaries. ""What we'll see is a landscape with many Trump wannabes without his personality and branding ability,"" said John Weaver, a GOP strategist who worked on the presidential campaign of Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R). ""The Democratic Party needs to nominate candidates who represent the hopes and the dreams of the working men and women of New Jersey,"" he said.",1876128835,Newspapers," Wagner, John

Unlikely footholds for E.U.'s far right,"The neighborhood is booming, with luxury homes going up as fast as workers can build them, a quietly efficient tramway to speed residents to work in the world-renowned city center, and parks, bike paths, art galleries, beaches and cafes all within a short amble. Voters young and old, rich and poor, urban and rural said they would back the Geert Wilders-led Freedom Party - no longer the preserve of the ""left-behinds"" - which promises to solve the country's problems by shutting borders, closing mosques and helping to dismantle the European Union. Unlike in France, where the economy continues to stagger nearly a decade on from the global financial crisis, the indicators in the Netherlands are broadly positive: falling unemployment, healthy growth and relatively low inequality. Compared with its neighbors, the Dutch took significantly fewer asylum seekers during the refugee crisis, and much of the country's nonnative population settled in the Netherlands decades ago. For much of the past two years, Wilders's Freedom Party has led the polls, though it has recently dropped into a virtual tie with the ruling center right. Because of the deeply fragmented nature of Dutch politics - there will be 28 parties on the ballot Wednesday - the Freedom Party could come out on top with just 20 percent of the vote. [...]he has already had an outsize influence, forcing rival politicians - including the prime minister, Mark Rutte - to shift their policies and rhetoric in his direction.

A Nightmare for Immigrants Is Great for Stocks,"When a member of the Trump administration issues a memo or executive order, gives a speech or tweets about the crackdown on immigrants, shares of the two companies rise: Since the election, CoreCivic's stock price has climbed 120 percent, and Geo's has gained 80 percent. For one thing, Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump's new attorney general, announced last month that the federal Bureau of Prisons will continue to rely on private prison companies. (Ms. Yates stayed on as acting attorney general in the Trump administration's first days, but the new president fired her on Jan. 30 when she refused to defend his executive order closing the nation's borders to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries.) In her August memo, Ms. Yates said the private prisons ""compare poorly to our own bureau facilities"" on financial grounds, adding that they lagged in rehabilitative services like educational programs and job training. [...]in a terse refutation of the Obama administration, Mr. Sessions said the Yates memo had ""impaired the bureau's ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system. [...]he said, ""I direct the Bureau to return to its previous approach."" In a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Feb. 22, for example, George C. Zoley, chief executive of the Geo Group, said that when it came to protecting the southern border of the United States, his company was ""the largest provider of detention services to the three federal agencies"" involved: Both Geo and CoreCivic are real estate investment trusts,...",1876131191,Newspapers," Sommer, Jeff

"In the era of Trump, a taxing concern","Federal law requires all workers to file income tax returns, even immigrants in the United States illegally.Since 1996, those who do not have a Social Security number can get a nine-digit Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) from the Internal Revenue Service.Some taxpayers who file this way are legal immigrants and foreign investors who do not have Social Security numbers.Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot has visited CASA workshops to reassure undocumented immigrants that his office, which processes state returns, will not share their private tax information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Critics of illegal immigration worry that undocumented immigrants are increasingly filing returns to take advantage of tax credits and other benefits that, they say, should be reserved for low-income families here legally. ""The reason that they're filing is to not pay income tax, but to get a cash welfare program benefit out of the government,"" said Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington. ""Immigrants paying taxes shouldn't be a controversial issue,"" said Jackie Vimo, policy analyst at the National Immigration Law Center, a nonprofit organization that advocates for low-income immigrants and their families.",1876131970,Newspapers," Sacchetti, Maria

San Francisco's exit from FBI task force carries risks,"Under pressure from civil liberties advocates and the Muslim community, the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) last month pulled out of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) amid controversy over the Trump administration's travel ban and concerns that participation in the task force might violate local laws protecting immigrants and religious minorities.There are 104 such task forces throughout the country - consisting of cells of analysts, SWAT experts and other specialists from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies that collectively assess intelligence and respond to terrorism threats.Civil rights advocates say that municipalities such as San Francisco should not be put in a position of cooperating with federal law enforcement agencies that conduct investigations in a manner that conflicts with local laws and that may share information that leads to noncriminal but undocumented immigrants being deported.Across the bay in the city of Oakland, the city's privacy advisory commission on Thursday recommended the City Council approve an ordinance requiring the police force to follow local rules rather than what the commission thinks are less restrictive strict FBI standards in criminal investigations.In Pasadena, Calif., in February, the city manager suspended an agreement between the police department and the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, which authorized joint investigations of human trafficking, drug smuggling and other non-immigration related crimes while the City Council considers a resolution declaring Pasadena a sanctuary city.",1876132109,Newspapers," Nakashima, Ellen

THE NATION; Travel ban begins to sour tourism; Reports of people being detained at U.S. airports make some reconsider visits.,"During spring break, Canadian families used to pile the kids into a tour bus and head to New York to see the Statue of Liberty, Rockefeller Center and other attractions. The fallout from President Trump's executive orders barring travel from some Middle Eastern and North African countries is having far-reaching implications for U.S. tourism It is not just visitors from the countries targeted by the bans that are souring on U.S. travel; the seven majority-Muslim countries included in Trump's original order in January account for 0.1% of incoming travelers.

City's letter to president raises public suspicions; Some San Bernardino residents say request for federal assistance on pot enforcement will only spread fear.,"' "" The letter was written by the mayor and signed by the city attorney, city manager and police chief, as well as all of the City Council members.The letter was not discussed publicly by the council before it was sent, and it focused heavily on requesting federal assistance with marijuana enforcement only a few months after voters overturned a citywide ban on pot businesses.Councilman Henry Nickel said he would welcome an ""initial surge"" in federal law enforcement to help boost the city's depleted Police Department, while Councilman James Mulvihill wanted to ask for only financial support.Scott mentioned that last year under the Obama administration, the U.S. Department of Justice approved a $2.8-million grant to help the city hire 11 new police officers.On Monday, several residents confronted the City Council at its meeting, and the city attorney warned that members might have violated the state's open-meetings law by approving the letter without a public hearing.City Atty. Gary Saenz last week said he planned to advise the council to rescind the letter to avoid a possible lawsuit over whether it was sent in violation of state law.",1876132965,Newspapers," Esquivel, Paloma

""There is a devil behind the door to liberation,"" said Paromita Shah, associate director at the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, an immigration rights group.Two lawsuits in California, including a class-action complaint filed last month, could bring new attention to the company's business practices and the control it wields over the lives of its clients.Jesus Escobar-Villalta, a 22-year-old asylum seeker from Honduras, said his GPS device began to bite into his ankle not long after his release from ICE custody.The company said in an email that its device was not to blame for his hospitalization and that ""if the client's hospital bill wasn't paid, it was because we never received a copy.""In Trump's capital, undocumented immigrants live and work in the shadow of the White House Rustic Camp David may be doomed with Trump as president Bill Dean throws wild Georgetown parties.",1876134291,Newspapers," Miller, Michael E

"Venezuelan Ballplayers Love Homeland, at a Safe Distance","Carlos Gonzalez, an outfielder for the Colorado Rockies, felt uneasy visiting his family and friends in Venezuela before the 2016 season, after an absence of three years, because for the first time he needed an armed security guard. With the help of his team at the time, the Nationals, and an immigration lawyer, Ramos secured permanent residency for himself and his wife and tourist visas for members of his family and his wife's family. Hector Rondon, a reliever for the Chicago Cubs and another member of the W.B.C. team, said he would like to obtain permanent residency in the United States for the safety of his family, which includes two young daughters. According to Baseball Reference, 358 Venezuelan players have appeared in the major leagues, trailing only the Dominican Republic's 669 for the most players from any country outside the United States. The Tigers' first-base coach, Omar Vizquel, was a longtime fixture at shortstop in the major leagues and is the manager of the Venezuelan team in the W.B.C. During the off-season, Vizquel said, he stays in touch with first baseman Miguel Cabrera and designated hitter Victor Martinez, both Florida residents who play for the Tigers and the W.B.C. team, about their safety when they return to Venezuela. Last fall, Carrasco's charity collected medical supplies -- in addition to school and baseball equipment -- to send to Venezuela.

"In Hollywood, conservatives keeping quiet; Some fear that their political beliefs are more of a career liability than ever.","The political closet is now a necessity for many in an industry that is among the most liberal in the country.Since the presidential election, some conservatives feel that their political beliefs are more of a career liability than ever -- even for those traditional Republicans disenchanted by President Trump.Prominent Republican supporters today include NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke, former Univision head Jerry Perenchio and producer Jerry Bruckheimer.Steven Mnuchin, who was national finance chairman of Trump's campaign and is now Treasury secretary, was a Wall Street executive and film financier whose executive producer credits include ""American Sniper,"" ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and ""Sully.""Co-CEO Ari Emanuel, a Democrat, is a friend of the president, having previously worked as his agent, while chief financial officer Chris Liddell recently left the company to become Trump's director of strategic initiatives.During the recent presidential campaign, a slew of entertainment bosses lined up to give money to Hillary Clinton, including Barry Diller, Haim Saban and ICM Partners' Chris Silbermann. ""Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party"" was savaged by critics and even earned a Razzie Award for the worst movie of 2016.[...]it's usually the opposite,"" said Lionel Chetwynd, the screenwriter and co-founder of Friends of Abe.JON VOIGHT, an actor who openly supports GOP candidates, spoke during Trump's inauguration festivities.",1876139292,Newspapers," Ng, David

MONTANA; Emerald state of mind; Celebrate St. Patrick's Day in the unlikeliest home to many Irish descendants -- Butte,"The Hibernian history of the state dates to the 19th century, when the Irish were escaping decades of famine. In the 1890s, prospectors in Butte struck gold and silver, giving the town its nickname, ""The Richest Hill on Earth."" Party by the old mine You can see the Irish influence all over town, from Cavanaugh's County Celtic shop, which bursts with First Communion dresses, tweeds and Waterford crystal, to the city's annual An Ri Ra festival. An Ri Ra may hold the honor of being the only festival in the U.S. (and probably anywhere for that matter) whose main stage is an old mine yard with its original head frame -- one of those tall steel structures atop a mine shaft -- now draped in fairy lights. National Historic Landmark District in the U.S. To get a sense of Butte's wealthy heyday, have a wander through Daly's 24,000-square-foot summer home three hours west in Hamilton, Mont. Lavish grounds provide the backdrop for the annual Bitterroot Celtic Games &amp; Gathering (Aug. 19 and 20, www.bcgg.org), where you can try Irish dancing, whiskey tasting, dog herding and, of course, Ireland's national sport, the ancient game of hurling -- a sort of cross between field hockey and soccer. -- Today you can catch a vaudeville show at the Virginia City Opera House, ride a stagecoach, pan for gold and, in the Bale of Hay Saloon, take a ghost tour between sips of microbrew.

New tilt to state high court? Kathryn Werdergar's retirement gives Gov. Brown a chance to appoint a fourth Democratic justice.,"Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar joined the California Supreme Court at a time when the electorate favored harsh punishment for offenders, domestic partnerships for gays were novel and conservatives dominated the state's highest court.California voters have scaled back tough crime laws, gay people may now marry, and for the first time in decades, the state's highest court will have a majority of Democratic appointees.Potential candidates for her seat include Court of Appeal Justice James M. Humes, a Brown appointee who had been his trusted deputy when Brown was attorney general and his top assistant in the governor's office.Humes, if selected, would become the first openly gay man to serve on the California Supreme Court.Even though she was a top law school graduate, the San Francisco native could not find a job at a law firm after graduation.Wilson appointed her a justice on the San Francisco-based appeals court and then elevated her to the state Supreme Court.",1876327001,Newspapers," Dolan, Maura

"THE NATION; Many frustrated liberals seeing red; Since Trump's victory, membership soars for the Democratic Socialists of America","New members of the Democratic Socialists of America say they want to build a grass-roots movement engaged at the local level -- and either pull the Democratic Party leftward or shove it out of the way. A few of the group's provocateurs infiltrated the well-dressed crowd of Democrats inside, where they shouted against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement: ""ICE out of L.A.!"" ""If you're gonna do it, have some fun,"" said Josh Androsky, a 30-year-old stand-up comedian who co-chairs the Los Angeles chapter's ""agit-prop"" committee and who joined after Trump's election. The Democratic Socialists of America's membership increase seems driven by three factors: younger Americans, who polls say are more open to socialism than previous generations; the 2016 Democratic primary campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist whose race ignited a grass-roots following but also left bitter feelings about the Democratic Party; and the galvanizing effect that Trump's election has had on left-leaning Americans. ""The farthest they can go is supporting elements such as Bernie Sanders,"" Marc Wells, a Trotskyist, said disdainfully as he handed out leaflets for the World Socialist Web Site at the International Women's Day strike in Los Angeles.

IMMIGRATION WATCH; Trump's border plans pose risks; Experts warn that high hiring goals may lead agencies to cut corners and allow unfit agents to serve.,"Customs and Border Protection, which includes the Border Patrol, is the largest law enforcement agency in the nation with about 43,000 officers and agents.In October, the inspector general for Homeland Security released a report saying that the Department of Homeland Security was slow to hire law enforcement positions.In February, after the executive orders were issued calling for more Border Patrol and ICE staff, Inspector General John Roth testified to a congressional committee that DHS ""will face a number of challenges"" in executing the orders.According to the report, the agency had added only 57, with plans to add just 30 more the next fiscal year.An internal memo last month from CBP Acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the agency wanted to take steps to meet the hiring goals, including waiving the polygraph exam for some applicants and giving itself the power to ""determine the type and level of background investigation needed for CBP positions.""Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union that represents agents, said the polygraph process had to be examined because many qualified candidates were being put through excessively long questioning -- often lasting four to eight hours or longer.",1876327129,Newspapers," Moran, Greg

Rhetoric heating up in Turkey over the 'executive presidency',"Abroad, the government's nationalist rhetoric is beginning to have an impact on the war against the Islamic State in Syria, according to U.S. officials, who cite Turkey's increasingly vociferous opposition to any battle plan that would include Syrian Kurds that Ankara regards as part of a terrorist group. Polls have shown the country evenly split or have reflected a slight edge for a ""no"" vote, which would represent an embarrassing defeat for Erdogan, who served as prime minister for 11 years before becoming president in 2014. Erdogan's supporters argue that the changes would leave the president free to govern what has become an unruly state, hobbled by political instability and coalition governments, and as the country faces threats to its stability from foreign and domestic militant groups. Or, as an informational campaign brochure distributed by the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party, or HDP, whose leaders have been jailed in the past few months, puts it: ""Can the deed of a country be given to one person?"" In a tight contest, the Turkish government is eager to turn out the expatriate vote, especially in Germany, which hosts a vast Turkish diaspora, including 1.4 million eligible voters, a majority of whom have tended to support Erdogan. [...]Mehmet Simsek, the deputy prime minister, said in an interview with foreign journalists in Ankara on Wednesday that the vote would provide Turkey with a measure of ""closure"" - regardless of the result.

ACLU positions itself as an aggressive Trump opponent,"Donations are pouring in as the group battles the president on many fronts Chris Vance was drinking his morning coffee and reading the text of President Trump's first executive order banning visitors from some Muslim-majority countries when he decided he had to take action. Donating to the ACLU has become an act of political defiance in the Trump era as the group has positioned itself as a high-profile and aggressive opponent of the president's agenda. Since the election, after which the group famously challenged Trump - saying that it would ""see you in court"" - membership has nearly tripled to 1.2million, and the group has collected more than $80 million in online donations alone. Some conservatives say the organization has shifted away from principles of free speech and religious liberties over the years in favor of popular liberal causes such as abortion and gay rights, and they say the ACLU favors atheists and other religions over Christians. Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice who has advocated for the rights of Christians, offered the example of the entry ban. The original version was blocked by a federal judge, whose decision was upheld by a federal appeals panel, but Trump has revised it in a way that his administration says passes legal muster. The legislation came after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the decision of the state of Oregon to deny unemployment benefits to two Native Americans after they were fired for testing positive for the...",1876328619,Newspapers," Somashekhar, Sandhya

A U.S. Attorney Who Shunned Politics Meets an End Tinged by Them,"(Both men have appealed.) As he leaves office, Mr. Bharara's prosecutors are reaching a critical juncture in a yearlong investigation into the campaign fund-raising of Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and are preparing to try a group of former aides and associates of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in a bribery and bid-rigging case. By the time his public corruption unit had won the convictions of Mr. Silver and Mr. Skelos, Mr. Bharara had successfully prosecuted a dozen current or former state legislators, as well as 15 local officials, party leaders, political consultants and fund-raisers, including two current or former New York City Council members. (Mr. Bharara was barred in response to his prosecution of Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer.) And Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has said there was ""malicious intent"" behind Mr. Bharara's prosecution of Reza Zarrab, a gold trader who has Turkish and Iranian citizenship, according to Turkish news reports. In the white-collar realm, Mr. Bharara may be best remembered for his sweeping crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry. The two most notable convictions growing out of a long-running investigation that began even before he took office were of Raj Rajaratnam, a hedge fund billionaire, and Rajat Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director and McKinsey managing partner who was convicted of passing an inside tip on to Mr. Rajaratnam. Mr. Bharara's office secured convictions or guilty pleas against more than 70 hedge fund traders, analysts and consultants in insider trading cases.",1876330238,Newspapers," Weiser, Benjamin

'Slowest Transition in Decades' Has Dust Piling Up in Key Offices,"[...]at departments like Treasury, Commerce and Health and Human Services, many senior posts remain vacant even as the agencies have been handed enormous tasks like remaking the nation's health insurance system. The lag has left critical power centers in his government devoid of leadership as he struggles to advance policy priorities on issues like health care, taxes, trade and environmental regulation. In the weeks since, the problem has been compounded by roadblocks of his own making: a loyalty test that in some cases has eliminated qualified candidates, a five-year lobbying ban that has discouraged some of the most sought-after potential appointees, and a general sense of upheaval at the White House that has repelled many others. According to data obtained by The New York Times, the Office of Government Ethics, the independent agency that conducts financial reviews of every presidential nominee, had received only 63 disclosure reports for prospective Trump administration nominees as of March 5, less than a third of the 228 that Mr. Obama's team had submitted by that date in 2009. At the Department of Homeland Security, one of three agencies for which the president has nominated a deputy, he has yet to name any of the four under secretaries, three assistant secretaries or other crucial players like a chief of Citizenship and Immigration Services or a commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.

No jail for pot? Not all are glad.,"The Arlington General District Court this month imposed the new policy for handling many misdemeanor marijuana possession cases, a change the top prosecutor said would make the court process quicker and less stressful for first-time offenders.[...]the county's public defender and immigration advocates are objecting because the shift also means that poor defendants in those cases will no longer get a free lawyer to help them understand - and perhaps fight - the charge.Because marijuana is still classified federally as one of the most dangerous drugs, illegal immigrants risk being deported if they're convicted of possessing marijuana - even if it's their first offense and the amount is small.Chief District Court Judge R. Frances O'Brien did not respond to a request for comment.Legal permanent residents would not face mandatory deportation, thanks to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, but Jordan said that if they leave the country they will not be able to get back in.J.D.

Threats on the rise at Va. mosque,"Hate crimes against Muslims shot up 67 percent in 2015, according to FBI statistics released at the end of last year, and hate crimes overall since then appear on track to outpace that year, according to new statistics compiled by Brian Levin, a criminologist at California State University at San Bernardino who tracks hate crimes. ""What I think is happening is we've seen a normalization of faith-based bigotry and it's translating in a variety of different ways, one of which, unfortunately, is hate-crime spikes,"" he said. Law enforcement officials in Texas and Florida are investigating fires at three mosques, at least two of which have been ruled arson. Near Seattle this month, a masked assailant wounded a Sikh man - a member of an Indian religious minority who are sometimes confused for Muslims because the men wear turbans - after shouting at him to ""go back to your country,"" and authorities are investigating it as a hate crime. Often it feels more as if they are reacting to a terrorist attack that has just occurred 3,000 miles away, or to something they saw on the news the night before, said Colin Christopher, the mosque's director of government affairs. Several days after the deadly 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris - and after a man, reacting to those attacks, had burst into Dar al-Hijrah's lobby and told people to leave the country and to accept Jesus - the mosque suffered hundreds of dollars in damage when someone tried to break through the...",1876332952,Newspapers," Hauslohner, Abigail

A politician in the Trump mold,"[...]in a time of relative prosperity, he has succeeded in focusing dark fears about what is happening in mosques across his land. The peroxide-blond Dutch politician Geert Wilders was executing the Donald Trump playbook long before the U.S. president started his insurgent campaign for the White House. In a bid to appeal to Wilders voters, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said this year that immigrants who do not work harder to fit into Dutch society should leave - a stark departure from a centuries-old Dutch tradition of acceptance. [...]despite his bar-the-door attitude toward immigration, his mother was born in Indonesia and his hair dye has bleached away the dark curls that once drew racist schoolyard taunts. Wilders has long been financially supported by some of the most extreme anti-Islam voices in the United States, and those activists have moved straight into the White House with Trump's election - a 2015 donation to Wilders of about $125,000 from David Horowitz, an anti-Islam activist who writes for Breitbart News, was the biggest single political donation in the country that year.

Joining forces to break a vicious cycle,"About 1 in 3 American women will experience intimate partner violence at some point in their lifetimes, with the majority becoming victims before their 25th birthday, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Women are far more likely to be killed by a spouse, an intimate acquaintance or a family member than a stranger, the Violence Policy Center found in a recent report.Every year their slayings - sometimes witnessed by their children or after they tried, to no avail, to leave a relationship - generate headlines and anguish in communities throughout the country.Kathleen Basile, a behavioral scientist at the CDC, calls this form of violence ""a public health crisis.""A CDC public survey found a relationship between domestic violence and increased health problems, including asthma, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic headaches and difficulty sleeping.[...]intimate partner violence has documented health impacts and comes at a financial cost to rolled her first ball up the lane.In Trump's capital, undocumented immigrants live and work in the shadow of the White House 'Call 911!'

Justice Dept. lays out defense of new Trump travel ban,"Judges in Maryland and Hawaii to hold hearings on order this week The Justice Department on Monday laid out its first significant legal defense of President Trump's revised travel ban, arguing in a court filing that the harms opponents say it causes are ""speculative"" and that the president was well within his authority to issue the directive. Responding to a lawsuit from the state of Hawaii, Justice Department lawyers asserted that Trump's new executive order solved any possible legal problems that came with the first one, because it was narrower in scope and outlined a robust list of people who might be exempted. ""While the new section differs from the original by excluding Iraqis, lawful permanent residents, and visa-holders, it bars entry for virtually all other individuals from the listed countries, including: relatives of U.S. citizens, students who have been admitted to state universities, prospective employees of state universities and...",1876665092,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

Steve Bannon and the Making of an Economic Nationalist; The controversial White House counselor says his father's 2008 financial trauma helped crystallize his antiglobalist views and led to a political hardening; 'I'm going to be totally wiped out',"RICHMOND, Va.--On Oct. 7, 2008, in the cramped TV room of his modest home here, Marty Bannon watched with alarm as plunging stock markets dragged down his shares of AT&amp;T, the nest egg he built during a 50-year career at the company. For supporters, he is helping to deliver on Mr. Trump's fiery populist promises, with their emphasis on punishing illegal immigrants and U.S. companies aiming to move jobs out of the country. [...]his decision to embrace ""economic nationalism"" and vehemently oppose the forces and institutions of globalization, he says, stems from his upbringing, his relationship with his father and the meaning those AT&amp;T shares held for the family. Since teaming up with Mr. Trump in August, Mr. Bannon has played a lead role in honing the Republican message sharply criticizing open borders, the mainstream news media , Wall Street and Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Under his leadership, the site ran increasingly controversial headlines such as ""The Solution to Online 'Harassment' Is Simple: Women Should Log Off,"" ""There's No Hiring Bias Against Women In Tech, They Just Suck At Interviews,"" and ""Hoist It High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage."" Mr. Bannon wanted the site to be ""the first and the loudest"" when it came to illegal immigration and the U.S. trade deficit, says Alex Marlow, Breitbart editor in chief. ""A stone cold racist, and a white supremacist sympathizer,"" New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a member of the House Democratic leadership team, said recently about Mr. Bannon,...",1876861392,Newspapers," Bender, Michael C

Trump's new entry ban will face legal challenge hours before it takes effect,"With President Trump's new entry ban set to kick in at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, lawyers and volunteers are mounting a last-minute campaign to halt the executive order in federal courts, mobilize protests and aid any travelers who might be stranded this time around.On Wednesday, federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland will hear arguments on whether to halt Trump's revised executive order, which suspends the U.S. refugee program, temporarily bars the issuance of new visas to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries and slashes refugee admissions to the United States this fiscal year from 110,000 to 50,000.The American Civil Liberties Union and others have called Trump's orders discriminatory, while federal officials say the actions seek to protect the United States from terrorism.[...]a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit unanimously upheld the judge's decision and kept Trump's entry ban on hold.Sirine Shebaya, a civil rights lawyer and member of the Dulles Justice Coalition, a group of mostly lawyers who mobilized after Trump's initial ban in January, said the organization is preparing for another wave of chaos and confusion at airports around the world.",1876993019,Newspapers," Sacchetti, Maria

Trump and Fed on a collision course?,"The more aggressive approach - which the Fed is expected to formally announce Wednesday afternoon after its officials telegraphed a rate hike for weeks - is a sharp contrast with prior meetings, when the hawks and doves of the central bank were more divided over whether to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates could choke off growth, push up the value of the dollar and make exports more expensive, or even destabilize a surging stock market that Trump has greeted as a sign of his administration's success. The Fed's confidence also stems from a global economy in which risks appear to be receding, after stumbles in China's stock market and news of Britain's upcoming exit from the European Union put the world on edge last year. Trump has promised a buffet of tax cuts, regulatory reductions, and defense and infrastructure spending increases that economists think could stimulate the economy and...",1876993042,Newspapers," Swanson, Ana

"E.U. Court, in 'Bold Step,' Allows Banning Head Scarves at Work","The European Union's highest court waded into the politically explosive issue of public expressions of Muslim identity on Tuesday, finding that private employers can ban female workers from wearing head scarves on the job. In its ruling, the European Court of Justice found that company regulations banning ""the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign"" did not constitute direct discrimination -- so long as such prohibitions applied to religious garb from all faiths, a requirement that legal experts say could also encompass a Sikh turban and a Jewish skullcap, among other religious symbols. In a case in May, Juliane Kokott, an advocate general with the court, issued an opinion saying that a company could prohibit a Muslim employee from wearing a head scarf, provided that the policy applied to attire for all religions and did not single out Islam. In a separate case, from July, Eleanor Sharpston, another advocate general for the court, said that Micropole, an information technology consultancy, had engaged in unlawful discrimination when it fired a Muslim woman, Asma Bougnaoui, in 2009 for refusing to remove her head scarf when dealing with clients.",1876998066,Newspapers," Bilefsky, Dan

"Dutch Leader Holds Off Populists, Exit Polls Suggest; Prime Minister Mark Rutte appears to have achieved goal of finishing ahead of anti-Islam firebrand Geert Wilders","Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's center-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy gained the most votes, putting Mr. Rutte in a strong position to form a new ruling coalition. Preliminary results, after 331 of the total of 388 polling stations counted the votes, put the premier's center-right party on track to win 32 seats, a 9-seat drop compared with 2012 but still ahead of Mr. Wilders's group, which was projected to tie for 19 seats with two other parties--the centrist D66 and the conservative Christian Democratic Alliance. Mr. Rutte late Wednesday held a victory speech to the cheers of a crowd gathered at The Hague's World Trade Center, saying his party's performance was a victory ""against the wrong sort of populism"" seen in the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union and the U.S. election. The outcome suggests that Dutch voters have elected a highly fragmented lower house of parliament,...",1877035026,Newspapers," Pop, Valentina

First of all, the Inspector Gadget character is not a gadget inspector, he's a dimwitted crime-fighter with gadgets embedded in his body.

Several crises greet U.N. chief,"[...]the world body's biggest donor, the United States, has a new government that is much more skeptical of foreign aid.On the trip to Baidoa, the new U.N. chief expressed frustration that Trump's latest activities had consumed the news cycle just as four countries are on the brink of famine or already experiencing it.Many people inside and outside the United Nations saw Guterres' predecessor, Ban Ki-moon, as reluctant to raise issues that might lead to tensions with world powers or implicate the United Nations.Akshaya Kumar, the deputy U.N. director at Human Rights Watch, said Guterres ""has a responsibility to push the council to talk about things they are not ready to talk about,"" including the conflict in Yemen, where a U.S.-backed coalition is battling rebels.Guterres has come in for some criticism for his handling of the European refugee crisis that erupted in 2015, with aid groups and former U.N. officials saying his agency did not do enough to push for the resettlement of people fleeing war.In 1994, campaigning for prime minister, he described himself as a man of compassion, but his sharp debating skills earned him the nickname of the ""talking pickax.""",1877050569,Newspapers," Sieff, Kevin

The deportation of America's future,"Trump's hard-line stance on immigration may be pleasing to his base of support who see it as the fulfillment of a campaign promise, but from a purely human perspective it is antithetical to the compassionate nature of the people I grew up around in the American South and Midwest.[...]Trump's new Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) initiative, christened during his first address to Congress, and framed by his shameless parading of three families whose relatives had been killed by people in the U.S. illegally, vilifies all undocumented immigrants.In spite of research that shows that recent immigrants, including foreign-born youth, are consistently less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, Trump's VOICE initiative, which will publicly document violent crimes committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally, seems intended to shame sanctuary communities and stoke public fear of Latin American and Muslim immigrants in general.After arriving as a child, Gutierrez eventually gained permanent resident status and was one of the nearly 8,000 foreign-born people who enlist in the armed services every year.MOISES CASTILLO/AP ; Photo: The parents of Capt.

[...]just a few days ago, however, many of those experts missed signals that the central bank would lift borrowing costs on Wednesday. Strong hiring, firming inflation, buoyant stock markets, a placid global economic outlook and Chairwoman Janet Yellen's upbeat congressional testimony last month didn't fundamentally alter Wall Street's view that the Fed would hold rates steady until later...",1877238024,Newspapers," Harrison, David

"Hawaii Judge Blocks Trump's Revised Travel Ban; In issuing nationwide restraining order, judge rules challengers likely to prove president's directive is unconstitutional","The original order, which produced chaos around the country , barred travel from Iraq as well as the other six countries and applied to a broader class of people, including visa holders and green-card recipients, who previously had permission to be in the U.S. Courts in the first round of litigation said the original order raised major due process concerns because it didn't give people advance notice of the policy or allow them the chance to argue that they should be allowed to travel. The White House took several steps in its revised order to address those due process concerns, and as a result the latest legal fight has focused on whether the travel ban violated the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from disfavoring particular religions. The appeal would go back to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , the same court that dealt the final blow to Mr. Trump's original executive order. Refugee-assistance groups and others, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, brought the Maryland case, saying immigrants and refugees would face immediate harm if the executive order was allowed to go live.

The Justice Department said it strongly disagrees with the federal district court's ruling, which it called ""flawed both in reasoning and in scope."" The revised order also sought to temporarily suspend the admission of refugees into the U.S. The original order, which produced chaos around the country, barred travel from Iraq as well as the other six countries and applied to a broader class of people, including visa holders and green-card recipients, who previously had permission to be in the U.S. Courts in the first round of litigation said the original order raised major due process concerns because it didn't give people advance notice of the policy or allow them the chance to argue that they should be allowed to travel. The White House took several steps in its revised order to address those due process concerns, and as a result the latest legal fight has focused on whether the travel ban violated the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from disfavoring particular religions. Any government appeal would go back to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the same court that dealt the final blow to Mr. Trump's original executive order.

Dutch Voters Rebuff Anti-Immigration Candidate; Prime Minister Mark Rutte achieved goal of finishing ahead of anti-Islam firebrand Geert Wilders,"Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's center-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy won the most seats, putting Mr. Rutte in a strong position to form a new ruling coalition. Preliminary results based on counting 94% of votes put the premier's center-right party on track to win 33 seats, an 8-seat drop compared with 2012 elections but still ahead of Mr. Wilders's group, which came second with 20 seats, followed closely by the conservative Christian Democratic Appeal and the centrist D66, both with 19 seats. Mr. Rutte late Wednesday held a victory speech to the cheers of a crowd gathered at The Hague's World Trade Center, saying his party's performance was a victory ""against the wrong sort of populism"" seen in the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union and the U.S. election.

How a late-night ride led to DACA recipient's arrest; Immigrant is accused of smuggling attempt but says he was duped.,"In the March 16 California section, an article about a DACA recipient's arrest on suspicion of immigrant smuggling said that Jesus Arreola Robles thought he was picking up an Uber passenger.The sinking feeling that something was amiss didn't hit Jesus Arreola Robles until just before midnight, right after he drove past a U.S. Customs and Border Protection truck in the desert near the border.A few minutes later, immigration officers handcuffed the 22-year-old North Hollywood resident, a beneficiary of the Obama administration's immigration relief program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.Border Patrol officials said Arreola Robles and a 17-year-old boy were stopped in a vehicle on Highway 94 in Campo, a town in East San Diego County about a mile from the U.S.-Mexico border.According to Arreola Robles' telling, he was babysitting his three younger sisters the night before around 7:30 p.m. when he got a call from a friend saying his cousin needed a ride that night from Sun Valley to the San Diego area and back.Porta said the Border Patrol stated in the documents that they apprehended a group of four people near Arreola Robles and Luis, and that one person had ""positive cellular communication"" linking them to Arreola Robles' phone.Beneficiaries must meet certain requirements, including having never been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanors, and not posing a threat to public safety or national security.Immigration agents confiscated his car and phone.",1877700615,Newspapers," Castillo, Andrea

JUDGE HALTS NEW BAN ON TRAVEL; A federal jurist in Hawaii blocks Trump's revised order hours before it was set to go into effect.,"Government lawyers said that the travel ban, a revised version of the Jan. 27 executive order that was blocked by federal courts, was modified enough to remove any legal concerns from judges.The new order tried to address court concerns by removing a preference for refugees who are religious minorities and giving exemptions from the ban to green-card holders and those who already have valid visas.Legal experts had predicted the new travel ban would be tougher to fight in court because of the president's broad authority over immigration enforcement and national security when it comes to noncitizens and those without visas.Arguments in court Wednesday centered on the federal government's argument that the order is a matter of national security, questions about the potential harm it could cause, and who has legal standing to sue.On Wednesday, he declined the states' request to extend his restraining order against the first ban to apply to the new order. -- jaweed.kaleem@latimes.com Times staff writer Laura King in Greenbelt, Md., and special correspondent Rick Anderson in Seattle contributed to this report.",1877701783,Newspapers," Kaleem, Jaweed

"As Trump's budget debuts, GOP balks at paying for wall","Republicans are showing increasing reluctance to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, even as President Trump prepares to ask Congress to include billions for one of his signature campaign promises in his first budget proposal since taking office. Democratic leaders have said they are prepared to block that interim spending bill if it contains funding for the wall. In the Senate, where Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 advantage over the Democratic caucus and funding bills need to clear 60-vote procedural thresholds to pass, there is little eagerness among Republicans to dive quickly into erecting a wall amid uncertainty about how it will be financed. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and other top Democrats warned GOP leaders this week that they are willing to risk a shutdown fight to block the wall. Some Republicans believe that combining the wall request with other military spending could be an effective way to pressure Democrats to vote for the bill.",1877701851,Newspapers," Sullivan, Sean

Liberals learn to love states' rights,"Dismayed by the Democrats' loss of the federal government, gloomy at the prospect of more such defeats to come and - in Baker's case - embittered by red states' dependence on federal funds disproportionately supplied by blue-state taxpayers, some lefties have concluded that if you can't lick 'em, leave 'em. Or take 'em to court, as blue-state attorneys general are doing to the Trump administration on immigration, in a mirror image of their red-state counterparts' lawsuits against President Barack Obama on the same issue. Twenty-eight states also have right- to-work laws, barring mandatory union dues, but no less a progressive man of labor than Andy Stern, former president of the Service Employees International Union, thinks more decentralization of federal labor law might help unions escape their seemingly terminal decline.

"Trump touts Andrew Jackson as his hero, and reflection","The Obama administration called for Jackson to be bumped from the $20 bill in favor of abolitionist leader Harriet Tubman, a decision that Trump at the time called ""pure political correctness."" In a recent survey of 91 historians conducted by the cable network C-SPAN, Jackson ranked 18th among U.S. presidents on 10 qualities of leadership. The White House's top Jackson history buff is Bannon, who invoked him in describing Trump's dark inaugural address - memorable for its reference to ""American carnage. The first time Jackson ran, in a four-way race in 1824, he had won a plurality of both the popular vote and the electoral college, only to see the House of Representatives vote to give the presidency to John Quincy Adams. Voter turnout quadrupled in the next election and Jackson handily ousted Adams from the White House.",1877702074,Newspapers," Johnson, Jenna

Trump has a lot riding on Ryan bill,"With the bill facing strong resistance on multiple fronts, Trump's effort to shepherd it through Congress is shaping up as a pivotal test of an unorthodox president's ability to wield influence in Washington, a growing number of Republicans say. [...]falling short on a marquee campaign promise - when both chambers are controlled by the president's party - would almost certainly sap momentum for Trump's agenda. [...]Republicans are counting on cuts from former president Barack Obama's health-care law to make the budget math work on other Trump priorities, particularly major tax reductions. During his daily press briefing Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump remained open to improving the bill but emphasized the urgency of moving forward on a long-standing Republican promise. White House aides point to progress on several executive actions, including Trump's second attempt at a travel ban targeting ""terror-prone regions,"" as the document describes them. A senior White House official said the document, modeled upon the ""Contract with America"" released by Newt Gingrich and other House Republicans during the 1994 midterm elections, remains a guiding light for the young administration. The president has said he is fully supportive of the bill crafted by Republican leaders, but he has also signaled being open to responding to conservatives' concerns on some counts, including the timing of a phaseout of expanded Medicaid coverage.",1877702267,Newspapers," Wagner, John

Trump seeks deep federal cuts,"EPA, STate dept. are hit especially hard Budget expected to face stiff head winds on Hill President Trump on Thursday will unveil a budget plan that calls for a sharp increase in military spending and stark cuts across much of the rest of the government including the elimination of dozens of long-standing federal programs that assist the poor, fund scientific research and aid America's allies abroad. Trump's first budget proposal, which he named ""America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again,"" would increase defense spending by $54 billion and then offset that by stripping money from more than 18 other agencies. The cuts could represent the widest swath of reductions in federal programs since the drawdown after World War II, probably leading to a sizable cutback in the federal non-military workforce, something White House officials said was one of their goals. Republicans have objected, for example, to the large cuts in foreign aid and diplomacy that Trump has foreshadowed, and his budget whacks foreign aid programs run by the Education, State and Treasury departments, among others. White House budget proposals are often changed by lawmakers, but they serve as a marker for how the president plans to govern and as an opening bid on budget talks. The proposed budget extensively targets Obama programs and investments focused on climate change, seeking to eliminate payments to the United Nations' Green Climate Fund - one key component of the U.S. commitment to the Paris climate agreement - and to slash research...",1877702374,Newspapers," Paletta, Damian

Hawaii judge halts new entry ban,"Trump's own comments, hinting at Muslim bias, highlighted in opinion A federal judge in Hawaii on Wednesday issued a sweeping freeze of President Trump's new executive order hours before it would have temporarily barred the issuance of new visas to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries and suspended the admission of new refugees. In a blistering 43-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson pointed to Trump's own comments and those of his close advisers as evidence that his order was meant to discriminate against Muslims and declared there was a ""strong likelihood of success"" that those suing would prove the directive violated the Constitution. Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said in a statement: ""The Department of Justice strongly disagrees with the federal district court's ruling, which is flawed both in reasoning and in scope. Lawyers for the state alleged that the new entry ban, much like the old, violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment because it was essentially a Muslim ban, hurt the ability of state businesses and universities to recruit top talent, and damaged the state's robust tourism industry. The next step might have been to persuade the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to rehear the case en banc, after a three-judge panel with the court upheld the freeze on Trump's ban. The circuit has 25 active judges, and the court said a majority had not voted in favor of reconsidering the three-judge panel's published opinion to keep Trump's first...",1877702557,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

Federal Judge Blocks New Ban on Travel to U.S.,"A federal judge in Hawaii issued a nationwide order Wednesday evening blocking President Trump's ban on travel from parts of the Muslim world, dealing a stinging blow to the White House and signaling that Mr. Trump will have to account in court for his heated rhetoric about Islam. [...]in a pointed decision that repeatedly invoked Mr. Trump's public comments, the judge, Derrick K. Watson of Federal District Court in Honolulu, wrote that a ""reasonable, objective observer"" would view even the new order as ""issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion, in spite of its stated, religiously neutral purpose."" Raising his voice to a hoarse shout, Mr. Trump accused the judge of ruling ""for political reasons"" and criticized the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which upheld the earlier decision against his administration and will hear any appeal to the Hawaii ruling. After he signed the revised ban, Democratic attorneys general and nonprofit groups that work with immigrants and refugees raced back into court against Mr. Trump, alleging that his updated decree was still a thinly veiled version of the ban on Muslim migration that he had pledged to enact as a presidential candidate. In addition to the Hawaii suit, federal judges in Washington State and Maryland heard arguments in several other cases challenging the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's order, including one brought by a coalition of Democratic attorneys general, and others from a collection of nonprofit groups.

"The 10-Point. A personal, guided tour to the best scoops and stories every day in The Wall Street Journal, from Editor in Chief Gerard Baker.","Good morning, Restrained Again A federal judge in Hawaii issued a nationwide temporary restraining order Wednesday that bars implementation of President Trump's revised executive order on immigration and refugees, a significant legal blow to the president's renewed bid to restrict U.S. entry for people from six Muslim-majority countries. Nudging Toward Normal The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it would raise short-term interest rates and keep lifting them this year, moving the central bank into a new, more aggressive phase of draining easy money from the financial system as the economy improves. The Justice Department announced the indictments of two officers of Russia's Federal Security Service, alleging they directed and paid for the illegal collection of information in the U.S. and abroad.

A Broadway Musical Brings Out Canadian Soft Power,"The show was already drawing an unusually high number of Canadian ticket-buyers, and an extraordinary amount of Canadian media attention, even before this week, when it hit the apotheosis of Canadianness: The country's charismatic and popular prime minister, Justin Trudeau, attended with a group of 600 allies and diplomats. On Wednesday night, Mr. Trudeau sat side-by-side with Ivanka Trump, the American president's daughter and close adviser, as the 100-minute musical celebrated the welcome extended by residents of Gander, a small town in Newfoundland, to thousands of air travelers diverted during the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The Trump administration is demanding to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement -- a pact strongly supported by Mr. Trudeau; the United States ban on immigrants from six predominantly Muslim countries, blocked on Wednesday by a federal judge, has set off a surge in asylum seekers fleeing from the United States to Canada, where they have largely been welcomed; and Mr. Trump's budget proposal would eliminate a federal program aimed at cleaning up the Great Lakes, which over 10 million Canadians rely on for their drinking water.

"Good morning. It is 6 a.m. It is ""Fox &amp;amp; Friends"" time. Do you have your coffee? Are you a little awake?","Other news networks were currently focused on House Republicans' controversial health-care plan, which had just been released. In the ""Fox &amp; Friends"" universe - a chatty, right-tilting, pre-breakfast digestion of the news - the main story was the bungle on Samantha Bee's program, ""Full Frontal."" Later that week, HBO host John Oliver would announce on ""Last Week Tonight"" his plan to deliver a message to the president about health care via a commercial he would pay to air during a ""Fox &amp; Friends"" ad break. Cable news in general, ""Fox &amp; Friends"" in particular, possibly for hours a day, knocking around the White House, tapping on his Android, having his sense of the country shaped by television. When they bring on the author of ""Reasons to Vote for Democrats"" - the joke is that the book is full of blank pages - the hosts don't seem to hate Dems so much as deeply pity them, as they also pity ""liberals"" or ""mainstream media."" (Are you listening, Mr. President?) Fish are shot in barrels full of straw men, as when the hosts discover that a college is inviting students to ""dream of diversity"" for an art installation. Opposing viewpoints are piped in infrequently, and usually in discrete sound bites (a clip of Bernie Sanders railing against the proposed health-care plan) that can then be dismissed without having to delve too deeply into unpleasant arguing.

"JUSTICE SYSTEM; Once called a hoax, Vallejo kidnapping leads to prison; Disbarred attorney Matthew Muller is given 40 years for abducting a couple in a 2015 case that police had initially labeled a 'wild goose chase.'","Huskins' family and friends grew teary eyed as she described her pain after Muller kidnapped her on March 23, 2015, and after the Vallejo Police Department, at one point, publicly portrayed the case as a hoax. Using a stun gun and a water pistol made to look like a gun, Muller ordered the couple to lie still while he bound and blindfolded them and gave them a sleep-inducing liquid, prosecutors said. Muller placed Huskins in the trunk of Quinn's Toyota Camry and moved her to the trunk of another car before driving her to his family's South Lake Tahoe home. Quinn objected and provided blood samples to prove he was drugged, and gave the FBI and police the passwords to his email accounts and his cellphone. Huskins ""did not act like a kidnapping victim,"" retired Vallejo Police Capt. James O'Connell later said in a sworn statement. Evidence gathered from a June 5, 2015, home-invasion robbery helped authorities link Muller to the kidnapping. Huskins and Quinn have filed a federal lawsuit, saying that because of the Police Department's allegations that her kidnapping was untrue, they were forced to move out of town, where they had worked as physical therapists, and their reputations were tarnished. In an interview last year from her Orangevale home, Joyce Zarback and her ex-husband said their son seemed on track in life -- a decorated Marine who graduated summa cum laude from Pomona College and went on to Harvard Law School.

President's words threaten to trip up his policies,"On entry ban, judges don't just read his order but also watch his mouth In blocking the administration's second attempt at a travel ban from terror-prone countries, a federal judge in Hawaii laid the blame squarely on President Trump and his advisers, who had suggested the policy was aimed at barring Muslims. On Thursday - for the 12th day in a row - the White House defended Trump's unfounded claim that his predecessor, Barack Obama, ordered wiretaps of Trump's New York City offices during the presidential campaign, despite a growing chorus of declarations from intelligence officials and members of Congress that nothing of the sort happened. ""Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,"" the Democratic and Republican chairmen of the Senate Intelligence Committee said Thursday in a statement. Show me the right way to do it legally.'"" In his blistering 43-page opinion issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson in Hawaii referred to those comments as well as a recent Fox News appearance by Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who said the second attempt at a ban would have ""mostly minor technical differences"" and that Americans would see ""the same basic policy outcome for the country.""

Court arrests by ICE raise alarm; Lawyers say the tactic will deter people in the U.S. illegally from testifying or seeking restraining orders.,"[...]activists, attorneys and prosecutors fear ICE's increased presence in courthouses could deter other immigrants without legal status from appearing in court to testify as witnesses or answer warrants, which ultimately could endanger prosecutions.ICE has made arrests in courthouses before, but the tactic drew rebukes in California after a series of raids led to the capture of women seeking restraining orders, people paying parking tickets and even one couple getting married inside a Kern County courthouse in 2013, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.Last week, Denver City Atty. Kristin Bronson also told several media outlets that she had to dismiss prosecutions against four domestic violence suspects because the complaining witnesses, all of whom are in the country illegally, were afraid ICE might learn their location through a court docket or send agents to the courthouse when they appeared to testify.Some law enforcement leaders in California and throughout the country have repeatedly expressed concern that Trump's promise to dramatically expand immigration enforcement will erode trust between minority communities and local police departments, a bond already weakened by years of scrutiny over officers' use of force throughout the country.ICE faced renewed scrutiny last month after the agency released a video showing immigration agents identifying themselves as police, a tactic decried by activists as unethical and police leaders as detrimental to local law enforcement's relationship with immigrant communities.",1878075957,Newspapers," Queally, James

The two leaders have clashed on spending for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the alliance created to counter Soviet advances during the Cold War and now used to help fight the Taliban in Afghanistan and to block Russian pressure in Eastern Europe.

THE TRUMP BUDGET; A salvo against 'sanctuary cities'; Trump wants to slash reimbursements to state and local jails,"The ""sanctuary cities"" designation has existed for decades and is applied differently by each place that claims it, but generally it means that local political and law enforcement leaders have rejected taking part in immigration enforcement, saying it makes immigrants less likely to report crimes or help police conduct investigations. A California law signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2013 bars state police from holding someone for immigration agents unless the suspect has been charged or convicted of a serious crime such as drug trafficking, child abuse or gang activity. Obama's budget last year sought to divert the funding to juvenile justice programs, crime statistics research and body cameras for local police, among other initiatives. Denying funding to some states and cities and not others could open the Trump administration to lawsuits, said Chris Rickerd, an expert on border security at the American Civil Liberties Union.

LETTERS; Justice for inmates,"Re ""Ex-Sheriff Baca found guilty,"" March 16 Finally, with the conviction of ex-Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, we have some justice for the many former jail inmates who were routinely beaten. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the current sheriff need to continue to look at serious reform in the department. At the door, as the inmates filed out, each received a Christmas card and a ""Merry Christmas"" greeting from the sheriff. Have we not seen this with the totally inept first travel ban and the horrendous healthcare bill, which will enrich the top earners and strip millions of insurance coverage? Answer (just to name a few inventors, and limited to recent United States history): Frederick M. Jones, air-conditioning unit; Henry T. Sampson, technology used in cellphones; George T. Sampson, clothes dryer; T.J. Marshall, improving the fire extinguisher; Garrett Morgan, gas mask; Robert Flemming Jr., guitar; John Albert Burr, lawn mower; W.A. Martin, improving the lock; Philip B. Downing, mailbox; John Standard, improving the refrigerator; Edmond Berger, spark plug; George Washington Carver, peanut products; and Joseph N. Jackson, remote control.

THE TRUMP BUDGET; Trump's sweeping cuts would fund 'hard power'; President's first budget shifts money from across government to boost defense and border security.,"On the chopping block: billions of dollars in research aimed at fighting diseases and climate change; job training programs; grants that pay for communities' public transit and housing; heating oil for the poor; diplomatic efforts across the globe; and libraries. Proposed for elimination: at least 19 independent agencies including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Many of the costs taken out of the budget would be shifted to states and localities -- which would lose grants they depend on to build bus lines, support teacher salaries or provide clean water to rural communities. ""The Trump administration says, 'We are going to leave it to state and local governments who are better positioned to deal with these issues,' but we are only better positioned if we have that partnership,"" said Phil Serna, a supervisor in Sacramento County, where a comprehensive plan to tackle the homeless problem is jeopardized by the White House budget. The cost of backfilling all the proposed federal cuts would crush Sacramento County's budget, Serna said, adding that the county can't afford to bankroll bedrock local environmental programs and would have to abandon an urban streetcar program getting underway as well as plans to extend mass transit to the region's new airport.

Who Undercut President Trump's Travel Ban? Candidate Trump,"Judge Theodore D. Chuang of Federal District Court in Greenbelt, Md. wrote that the likely purpose of Mr. Trump's new order was ""the effectuation of the proposed Muslim ban."" The president and his aides deny that the president is targeting Muslims and have insisted that a temporary ban on travel for refugees and visitors from predominantly Muslim nations -- seven that were singled out in Mr. Trump's first order and six in his most recent revision -- is necessary so that security officials can ensure proper vetting is conducted to prevent threats. Mr. Trump's first attempt to impose a travel ban was blocked by a federal judge in Washington State after several days of chaos in which travelers, including permanent residents and those holding valid United States visas, were prevented from entering. In the White House, Mr. Trump and his advisers say those courts were wrong, but they chose to write a narrower travel ban in the hopes of avoiding a lengthy legal battle that might take them all the way to the Supreme Court. The first attempt at a travel ban by Mr. Trump and his senior aides -- including Stephen Miller, his top adviser on immigration issues --...",1878093086,Newspapers," Shear, Michael D

The lasting damage of Trump's campaign rhetoric,"A surprising additional risk to Trump's presidency is a subtle variation on the above: that regardless of attempts at moderation, his actions in the White House would never escape the shadow of his insurgent candidacy. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday, followed by District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland. ""Simply because a decision maker made the statements during a campaign does not wipe them from the 'reasonable memory' of a 'reasonable observer.'"" The legal fight could head to the Supreme Court. Dissenting judges at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard the first immigration ban case, agreed with the government that motive shouldn't be a deciding factor in a ruling, as long as there is a legitimate reason for the action.

No new warmth between two leaders,"Merkel, Trump still clash on policy, and personally, at White House summit A White House summit Friday aimed at easing friction between President Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel was undermined by the visible lack of warmth between the two leaders and sharp differences on immigration and trade. Beyond policy, their summit was marked by an Oval Office photo op during which Trump appeared to disregard Merkel's suggestion that they shake hands and he generally avoided making eye contact with her as news photographers captured the scene. [...]Trump put the German leader on the spot during their news conference when he made an awkward joke about them having ""something in common"" over his unfounded allegations that President Barack Obama had ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to wiretap Trump Tower in New York.

Not going back,"Diana Wolff, Rancho Palos Verdes :: Are Americans' memories so short that we've forgotten taxpayers recently had to bail out two U.S. auto companies for exactly the kind of wrongheaded thinking that led them to oppose higher fuel economy standards? If U.S. automakers move in the other direction, they will be pushing against global consumers who are demanding more fuel-efficient vehicles. More than 50 years of work toward cleaner motor vehicles will not be cast aside to satisfy this administration's predilection for corporate profit over the health and welfare of the people who make those corporations so profitable. Unfortunately, not many people remember today what the air in Los Angeles was like before smog laws were enacted, and not many people remember the bitter fighting the auto industry put up to try to thwart those regulations only to go through the pitiful and easily ridiculed motions of cleaning up their products until they were forced to make real progress.

U.S. News: Gorsuch Criticizes Agency Powers,"  Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, whose confirmation hearing begins Monday, has been unusually forceful with his concerns that judges allow government agencies too much power to make policy, a red flag for liberals who worry that such views could weaken environmental, labor and health regulations. To Judge Gorusch, who sits on the Denver-based 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, Chevron creates problems because it can give agencies room to enact policies better left to Congress, without a robust review by judges.",1878356547,Newspapers," Kendall, Brent

U.S. News: Ruling On Revised Travel Ban Is Appealed,  The Justice Department formally appealed a Maryland judge's decision this week that blocked the implementation of President Donald Trump's revised executive order barring U.S. entry for people from six Muslim-majority countries. The appeal kicks off a new phase in litigation over whether Mr. Trump's latest travel restrictions improperly target people based on their religion. The president says the restrictions are necessary to protect the country from terrorism.,1878356963,Newspapers," Kendall, Brent

U.S. News: Hawaii's Muslims Voice Fears,"  Hawaii may seem an unlikely place to challenge -- and halt -- President Donald Trump's travel ban. Only a half-dozen of refugees are settled here each year. The small Muslim community has quietly thrived, away from the conflicts on the mainland. They built a mosque in the hills overlooking Waikiki, celebrated the end of Ramadan on the beach, and enjoyed good relationships with neighbors in this multicultural state. Anti-Islamic threats or hate speech was virtually unheard of, Muslims here say. But that has changed in recent weeks, as Hawaii's Muslim community has found itself at the center of the nationwide battle over immigration and Islam's place in American society.",1878360013,Newspapers," Lovett, Ian

Leave the 9th Circuit alone,"The 9th Circuit -- the largest and most important of the 13 federal court circuits in the country, encompassing 11 Western states and territories and covering nearly 20% of the U.S. population -- is under siege. [...]none of these complaints is sound. [...]breaking up the court would add considerable costs while potentially lowering the quality of judging. Most of the justifications offered for splitting the 9th Circuit have to do with its size, and it does indeed hear a lot of cases -- more than 55,000 civil and criminal cases in its district courts in 2015 alone, along with 12,000 appeals in its appellate court. The 9th Circuit also encompasses some of the most experimental states in the country, including Arizona, which frequently passes innovative immigration laws; Oregon, with its expansive individual-rights laws on assisted suicide and marijuana; and, of course, California. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, has been a conservative bugaboo since the 1970s, when President Carter and a Democratic supermajority in Congress doubled the number of judges on the court and appointed some of the most liberal jurists in American history.

The poison of the blacklist,"Since 2007, the Southern Poverty Law Center has methodically added mainstream organizations critical of current immigration policy to its blacklist of ""hate groups,"" including the Federation for American Immigration Reform, the Immigration Reform Law Institute and Californians for Population Stabilization, among others. Reasons two and three are almost too trivial to believe: CIS's weekly email roundup of immigration commentary (from all sides) has occasionally included pieces by writers who turned out to be cranks; and a nonresident CIS fellow attended the Christmas party of a group the SPLC dislikes. Equating a group that has such a track record of engagement in the public policy debate with, for instance, the Holy Nation of Odin has nothing to do with warning the public of ""hate."" [...]the SPLC stands apart; it's backed by a quarter-billion-dollar war chest, successful branding by SPLC co-founder and direct- marketing impresario Morris Dees, and a pose of disinterestedness...",1878508615,Newspapers," Krikorian, Mark

New tack in the fight over travel ban; Justice Department asks a Hawaii federal judge to issue a more limited ruling in halting Trump's order.,"If the administration's request is granted, the Hawaii ruling would then largely match a Maryland federal court order against the travel ban that was issued on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Theodore D.

Homegrown labor in short supply; Trump's immigration crackdown threatens to worsen state farmworker shortage,"Growers who can afford it have already begun raising worker pay well beyond minimum wage.Wages for crop production in California increased 13% from 2010 to 2015, twice as fast as average pay in the state, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Some farmers are even giving laborers benefits normally reserved for white-collar professionals, like 401(k) plans, health insurance, subsidized housing and profit-sharing bonuses.[...]companies growing high-value crops, like Cabernet Sauvignon grapes in Napa, are luring employees from fields in places like Stockton that produce cheaper wine grapes or less profitable fruits and vegetables.Last year Klein, a fourth-generation Stockton farmer, ran a mental ledger, trying to sort out the pros and cons of persevering in the wine business or quitting.Wineries pay Klein a tiny fraction of what they pony up for the same grape variety grown in Napa, and the rising cost of labor meant he was losing money on his vineyards.Wineries paid $700 for a ton of grapes, and Klein could make a solid profit paying $8 an hour, the minimum wage.Klein knew his vines were done for when California passed laws raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2023 and requiring daily overtime for field laborers.(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX) California farmworkers Born in U.S.: 9% Born in Mexico: 89% Undocumented: 56% Non-Latino: 4% Average highest grade completed in school: 7th Source: The National Agricultural Workers Survey, U.S. Department of Labor Caption: PHOTO:",1878508651,Newspapers," Kitroeff, Natalie

A tall order for 'Trump's Mini-Me' in Virginia,"With a ravenous appetite for rhetorical bombast, Stewart is campaigning as an unapologetic disciple of President Trump, echoing the president's populist diatribes against the Republican establishment, undocumented immigrants, political correctness and the media. Yet Stewart had only a quarter of the nearly $2 million that Gillespie amassed by the start of this year, according to campaign finance records, and recently sent out fundraising pleas that he said would ""help cover"" the cost of gas, a sound system and security needed to stage a rally. Mixed reviews of approach Four years ago, during Virginia's previous gubernatorial race, a civil war erupted within the state's Republican Party between the business-oriented establishment and grass-roots activists who included libertarians and tea party loyalists. The activists won the struggle, nominating at the party's convention Ken Cuccinelli II, then the state's attorney general, though the division helped lead to Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe's victory. ""Gillespie has been the marriage counselor that the Republican Party needed,"" said Quentin Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Since his forays to Charlottesville ""there has been a palpable change in the direction of the campaign,"" he said, predicting that his standing in future polls ""will have dramatically shifted. Recalling the moment, Willie Deutsch, a conservative school board member, said it suggested that Stewart ""is more focused on winning over audiences he is speaking to than sticking with a core set of principles.",1878508653,Newspapers," Schwartzman, Paul

The battle over who gets to vote,"Said Franklin: ""Today a man owns a jackass worth fifty dollars and he is entitled to vote; but before the next election the jackass dies."" [...]the man cannot vote. On April 11, 1865, speaking from a second-floor window at the White House, Abraham Lincoln announced that he had decided to back voting rights for some African Americans. The greatest breakthrough of all came in the wake of the turbulent 1960s, when the civil rights movement first won passage of the Voting Rights Act, and states enacted constitutional amendments to end poll taxes and to lower the voting age to 18. Conservative partisans realize they can eke out an advantage by changing voting rules. Since 2011, dozens of new state laws have been passed by legislatures trying to make it harder to vote. In North Carolina, a unanimous appeals court panel ruled the state's 2013 voting restrictions had been written to ""target African Americans with almost surgical precision."" Holder ruling, the justices gutted the Voting Rights Act by no longer requiring states with a history of discrimination to ""preclear"" their voting rules with the Justice Department or federal judges.

LETTERS,"[...]we'll be safe Re ""Trump's draconian wish list,"" editorial, March 17 If President Trump's first proposed federal budget gets implemented, Americans will be safe within their border walls. Funding cuts to the National Endowment of the Arts, Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio will affect many Americans who have been blessed with these fine services that cannot survive without government help. While Americans have a wide range of opinions on immigration, the majority oppose these ill-conceived and inconsistent measures that place no restrictions on travelers from the countries that were home to the 9/11 hijackers, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, while targeting students, families and thoroughly vetted refugees from other nations. Robert Sinkovits La Jolla :: So sad that Democrats' protestations against border security and travel ban measures aren't likely to win back voters. Try opposing legislation that would mandate long prison terms for flag-burning or permit public school teachers to lead classroom prayers, and the party forfeits any chance of an electoral victory. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has avoided most opportunities to answer questions from the press probably due to the lack of development of any foreign policy by his boss and his jesters.

Expect that to change on Monday when the Senate Judiciary Committee will launch four days of hearings to determine whether Gorsuch can win the votes needed for confirmation. Trump's criticisms of the judicial branch, his ethnicity-based attack on a Latino judge and his willingness to push legal bounds with two travel bans now blocked by courts raise the stakes for a high court seat that will help serve as a final check on the administration's policies, they say.

ARCHITECTURE; BUILDING TYPE; Basking in Trump wall's shadow,"[...]their path of least resistance is often to move into and occupy vacuums in the physical landscape. After the Department of Homeland Security announced last month that it would be soliciting fast-track bids for ""several prototype wall structures in the vicinity of the United States border with Mexico,"" and then start awarding commissions to build actual stretches of wall by mid-April, a debate broke out about whether it made ethical sense for architects and engineers to take part. According to reporting by Kriston Capps for the website CityLab and my colleague Carolina Miranda in The Times, many large firms, including Bechtel, Boeing and AECOM, decided not to participate in the bidding process. [...]more Mexican immigrants have left the United States to return to Mexico since 2008 than have migrated to this country; what's more, immigrants on the whole are less likely to commit crimes than people born here.)

A partnership that shaped populism,"The champagne was flowing as hedge fund executive Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah hosted a reception during the Cannes Film Festival last May to promote ""Clinton Cash,"" a film by their political adviser Stephen K. Bannon and the production company they co-founded, Glittering Steel. While better-known players such as the Koch brothers on the right and George Soros on the left focus on mobilizing activists and voters, the Mercers have exerted pressure on the political system by helping erect an alternative media ecosystem, whose storylines dominated the 2016 race. Glittering Steel, the Mercer film production company, then brought the book's findings to the screen, portraying Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to a mass audience as a captive of wealthy interests. [...]the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010 paved the way for new forms of unlimited political spending - an opening seized upon by mega-donors on the right opposed to gave $2 million between 2013 and 2014 to the Government Accountability Institute, the Tallahassee-based investigative think tank founded by Bannon and Schweizer. Glittering Steel produced videos for the Mercer-funded super PAC Make America Number 1, which paid the production company about $700,000, according to campaign finance filings. Cambridge was also paid at least $6 million for the work it did helping the Trump campaign identify and target voters, finance filings show. Since the election, its parent company, SCL Group, has stepped up its pursuit of U.S. government contracts.",1878508793,Newspapers," Gold, Matea

Trump defenders' perplexing mission,"[...]how does a dense, small-circulation journal packed with lengthy articles written by assorted theorists exert influence over a president who disdains elites, thinks in outraged bursts, relies on an insular group of advisers, binges on cable news and reads little other than news clips about himself? ""Faced with a political process no longer responsive to or even aware of the stagnation of a middle class once ever improving, those voters grabbed for what they saw as the lost precondition of politics: political sovereignty,"" argues American Affairs deputy editor Gladden Pappin. McGill University management professor Reuven Brenner knocks U.S. policymakers' deference to the ""priesthood of tenured economists,"" only to see National Security Council official Michael Anton criticize the American foreign policy establishment as a ""priesthood"" as well in a subsequent article. American Affairs editor Julius Krein gives anti-elitism a thinkier veneer in his celebration of political theorist James Burnham, author of the 1941 bestseller ""The Managerial Revolution,"" on a new class of technocratic managers wielding economic and political power via corporations and state bureaucracies. [...]savvy.) Pappin recasts Trump's doomsaying inaugural address on the carnage that is America today into a sweet, comforting call for ""civic friendship."" Sandel suggests that workers spanning multiple industries participate in the nation's trade negotiations, and that even congressional representation could be apportioned according to different guilds and professions rather than by geography and population.",1878508794,Newspapers," Lozada, Carlos

The Devil inthe diverse city,"Before his inauguration, in a spat with Atlanta's representative in Congress, he tweeted: ""Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested).""For decades, like-minded people have been clustering geographically - a phenomenon author Bill Bishop dubbed ""the Big Sort "" - pushing cities to the left and the rest of the country to the right.When Trump connects immigration to Mexican cartel crime, he's putting a menacing foreign face on white anxiety about the country's shifting demographic profile, which is pushing traditional white, Judeo-Christian culture out of the center of American national identity. ""The ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty,"" wrote Michael Anton , now a White House national security adviser, is ""the mark of a party, a society, a country, a people, a civilization that wants to die.""A new study of urban crime rates by a team of criminologists found that ""immigration is consistently linked to decreases in violent (e.g., murder) and property (e.g., burglary) crime"" in the period from 1970 to 2010.What's more, according to an analysis of FBI crime data, counties labeled as ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions by federal immigration authorities have lower crime rates than comparable non-sanctuary counties.An exclusive, nostalgic national identity acts like a cancer in the body politic, eating away at the bonds of affinity and cooperation that hold our interests together.",1878508855,Newspapers," Wilkinson, Will

No new warmth between two leaders,"Merkel, Trump still clash on policy, and personally, at White House summit A White House summit Friday aimed at easing friction between President Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel was undermined by the visible lack of warmth between the two leaders and sharp differences on immigration and trade. Beyond policy, their summit was marked by an Oval Office photo op during which Trump appeared to disregard Merkel's suggestion that they shake hands and he generally avoided making eye contact with her as news photographers captured the scene. [...]Trump put the German leader on the spot during their news conference when he made an awkward joke about them having ""something in common"" over his unfounded allegations that President Barack Obama had ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to wiretap Trump Tower in New York.

Steve King was half right. Immigrants do change the culture.,"Journalist says we revised our self-conception Rep. Steve King's tweet this past week in defense of Geert Wilders, the anti-immigrant Dutch politician, won the Iowa Republican praise from white supremacists but a put-down from his colleagues. The Harvard-trained lawyer Prescott Hall, co-founder of the Immigration Restriction League, posed this question in 1897: ""Do we want this country to be peopled by British, German, and Scandinavian stock, historically free, energetic, progressive, or by Slav, Latin, and Asiatic races, historically downtrodden, atavistic, and stagnant?"" Congress offered an answer in 1924 by enacting national-origin quotas, allowing Northern and Western Europeans virtually unlimited entry while restricting immigration opportunities for Southern and Eastern Europeans and effectively excluding Asians, Africans and Middle Easterners. The commission's report, titled ""Whom We Shall Welcome,"" concluded that ""national uniformity"" was neither desirable nor necessary, because ""an outstanding characteristic of the United States is its great cultural diversity within an overriding national unity."" Political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset advanced de Tocqueville's notion of American exceptionalism with his proposition that becoming an American is ""an ideological act"" akin to adopting a new ""political religion"" whose creed includes five essential ideas: liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, populism and a laissez-faire approach to governance and daily life. In 1994, according to the Pew Research Center, 63 percent of Americans saw immigrants as a burden on the nation. [...]diversity promotes tolerance, not conflict. A 2013 study by the Anti-Defamation League found that while 36 percent of Hispanic Americans born outside the country harbored anti-Semitic views, the number...",1878508907,Newspapers," Gjelten, Tom

The Trump disciple vs. the 'illegals',"For years, she has felt she was living the American Dream in reverse, her life sliding backward, in part, she believes, because illegal immigrants take good jobs and drive up her taxes. The way she sees it, life is easier for illegal Mexican immigrants than for taxpaying, working-class white Americans. Little galls her more than ""anchor babies,"" who are entitled to government benefits, including Medicaid, public schools and food assistance. In Texas, undocumented immigrants accounted for a quarter of all deliveries paid for by Medicaid in 2015 - more than 54,000 babies - according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. According to a recent CNN/Kaiser poll, 55 percent of whites without college degrees said they want everyone living in the country illegally to be deported. Increasingly, the first question in any job interview is, ""Habla espanol?"" So when Trump started talking about deporting illegal immigrants who ""compete directly against vulnerable American workers,"" Estes went to his rallies and stuck a Trump sign on her lawn. Some Texas officials have pursued a backdoor approach to cutting benefits to the children of undocumented parents by limiting the forms of parental identification they will accept when issuing birth certificates. After Mexican and Central American parents sued in federal court, Texas officials agreed last year to accept more forms of identification, including Mexican voter ID cards - but only after more than 1,000 babies were denied birth certificates, said Jennifer Harbury, an attorney with Texas RioGrande Legal Aid.",1878767795,Newspapers," Jordan, Mary

"In Tampa, the historic cigar town faces a cloudy future","[...]by my count I'd smoked at least 15 cigars during the previous 48 hours.Yet in Ybor City, it seems as if - whether perversely or refreshingly - one enters a parallel universe where smoking cigars is still a totally natural part of life.At King Corona, I had perused the rows of hundreds of tightly stacked cigars in dozens of garishly labeled boxes inside the humidor before I settled on a box-pressed Padron 1964 Anniversary Series.What size of ring gauge did I want: a thinner lancero or a thicker Churchill or Presidente? I learned that Nicaragua's volcanic soil created a more complex, peppery tobacco, while in Honduras, planted near sugar cane, tobacco had more sweetness.Yet even with all cigar connoisseurship happening up and down Seventh Avenue, it was hard to ignore that Ybor City - a National Historic Landmark District - had seen better days.[...]beyond the small storefront producers still rolling premium handmade cigars, only one large cigar factory remains.At one point, the woman literally blew smoke into Gwendolyn's face, then realizing her faux pas, said, ""Oh my god, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to blow it in your face!"" Gwendolyn shrugged and said, ""Oh honey, I'm used to it.""",1878767800,Newspapers," Wilson, Jason

Schools address deportation fears as families react to Trump moves,"Parents, teachers and administrators have raised questions about how schools should respond if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents come to a school to take away students or obtain records - even though the agency's policy restricts enforcement actions on school grounds. The Los Angeles school board voted days after the November election to resist any Trump administration attempts to use student data against students or families in immigration matters. In Virginia, the state schools chief urged local superintendents this month to ensure schools have current emergency contact information for parents and to prepare for situations in which children are stranded at school. Trump has pledged to deport millions of unauthorized immigrants and erect a wall on the southern border to stop more from entering the country. Since taking office, he has expanded the pool of immigrants prioritized for deportation, sped up some deportation proceedings and called for hiring more border patrol and immigration enforcement officers. Carissa Cuttrell, a spokeswoman for ICE, said the Department of Homeland Security ""is committed to ensuring that people seeking to participate in activities or utilize services provided at any sensitive location are free to do so without fear or hesitation.""

Trump's immigration plan faces obstacles; Shift to a 'merit-based' system may not deliver the economic benefits he predicts.,"President Trump wants to reform the immigration system to favor foreigners who have special skills that would contribute to the U.S. economy, breaking from a decades-long practice of giving preference to family members of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. The larger inflows from Asia's growing affluent class partly explains the increase in immigrants' education and skill levels -- and that trend is likely to continue even without converting to a merit-based system, which Giovanni Peri, a specialist in international migration economics at UC Davis, sees more as a maneuver aimed at drastically cutting immigration. Trump has said nothing precise about his desired immigration numbers, although in a major speech as a candidate last summer he called for keeping ""immigration levels, measured by population share, within historic norms"" -- language that groups have used when pointing to the 1960s and '70s, when the immigrant share of the nation's population was about 1 in 20 people, rather than 1 in 8 as it is today. [...]Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who has talked with Trump about immigration and seems to be in line with his thinking, joined Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) in introducing legislation that would not only reorient policy to favor the highly skilled, but also slash total immigration by 40% to 50%, largely by limiting family-sponsored visas and cutting the number of refugee entrants in half. The result has been frequent tinkering of the point system -- it now gives heavy weight to immigrant applicants with job offers -- and constant...",1878701503,Newspapers," Lee, Don

CAPITOL JOURNAL; No such thing as free lunch -- or legislation,"No spending bill can advance through the Legislature that doesn't pinpoint precisely its source of money. The goal is to eliminate the need to borrow money for nearly 400,000 low- and middle-income students on UC and Cal State campuses. ""A debt-free college education is a laudable goal. Last week, for example, Assemblyman Tony Thurmond (D-Richmond) proposed giving school districts $100 million so they can partner with developers to build affordable housing for teachers. Ricardo Lara of Bell Gardens and Toni Atkins of San Diego -- to enact a single-payer healthcare system for California. Before the Legislature enacts any more grandiose, very expensive programs, it should summon the courage to do one essential thing: reform the state tax system to stabilize the revenue stream. Trump's proposed federal budget -- which U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called ""the most draconian"" she'd ever seen -- would stiff California of many billions of dollars....",1878701768,Newspapers," Skelton, George

She once made liberals hopeful; Ivanka Trump is now seen as 'complicit' in her father's agenda.,"Soon after the presidential election, a group of New York artists started a social media campaign dubbed #dearivanka.The artists considered her part of the ""liberal bubble of New York,"" said Alison Gingeras, an art curator and one of the organizers of the initiative known as Halt Action Group.While she may have softened President Trump's stance on equal pay for women and child care for working mothers, he has pushed ahead with hard-line conservative measures on immigration, the environment and domestic spending, leaving liberals feeling betrayed.There she is standing in the Oval Office jiggling a baby, posing on the steps of the Supreme Court with her daughter or popping up in meetings with heads of state.When Nordstrom announced it was dropping her fashion line because of weak sales, the president took to Twitter to complain that the department store chain was treating her ""so unfairly.""The next day, presidential aide Kellyanne Conway urged viewers of a Fox News show to buy Ivanka's products, prompting a rebuke by the government's ethics watchdog.During the transition, she helped bring former vice president and environmental activist Al Gore to Trump Tower to brief her father, a skeptic about climate change, and floated the idea of becoming a climate czar within the administration.",1878701797,Newspapers," Demick, Barbara

IMMIGRATION; Malibu votes to adopt 'sanctuary city' status; Officials narrowly approve resolution as a gesture of solidarity with workers who are in the U.S. illegally,"The discussion inside Malibu City Hall over whether to become a sanctuary city last week bore the usual hallmarks of the heated national debate over illegal immigration.The idea was inspired by one of the town's many famous residents: actor Martin Sheen.In December, he grabbed the lectern during a City Council meeting and -- as if conjuring his inner President Josiah Bartlet from ""The West Wing"" -- urged the city to become a sanctuary city.Everyone agrees the city has workers who are not authorized to be in the country, and they tend to serve the food at upscale eateries, clean the beachside mansions, look after children and keep the landscaping looking lush.In the face of ""that heroic resolution, and the heightened level of fear gripping so much of our nation since Nov. 8, we urge the council to adopt a resolution declaring the city of Malibu a sanctuary city.""[...]the city contracts out its policing and jailing to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.At the council meeting, resident Elizabeth Stevens recalled how she worked two jobs to get through school and get a car, only to have it totaled by someone who was in the country illegally.For some cities, the sanctuary movement has simply been a push to get people without legal status more involved in government.",1878701822,Newspapers," Oreskes, Benjamin

Gorsuch hearings will test the GOP,"no democrats have pledged support Republicans see him as able successor to Scalia When Judge Neil Gorsuch arrives on Capitol Hill on Monday morning to begin his confirmation hearings for a seat on the Supreme Court, he will give President Trump his first chance to make a lasting imprint on the federal judiciary - and Republicans a fresh test to work their will now that they control all of Washington's levers of power. Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge from Colorado, was promoted by conservative legal activists because of his sterling credentials, a decade of right-of-center rulings and his allegiance to the same brand of constitutional interpretation employed by the late justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia. The left also remains angry about a Supreme Court seat that has been vacant since Scalia died 13 months ago, after which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) decided to block a hearing for President Barack Obama's selection for the seat, Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Gorsuch seemed to forecast what might await him from Democrats in a 2002 column he wrote lamenting the state of the Supreme Court nomination process: ""When a favored candidate is voted down for lack of sufficient political sympathy to those in control, grudges are held for years, and retaliation is guaranteed."" In November exit polls, more than 1 in 5 voters said that Supreme Court appointments were ""the most important factor"" Many conservative activists and GOP lawmakers say that...",1878701837,Newspapers," O'Keefe, Ed

Free pass for bosses; Few businesses are punished for illegal hiring,"Agents pored over records to ferret out forged documents or fake Social Security numbers, and thousands of workers, fearful of being caught without papers, fled the state. The law, commonly called IRCA, granted residency to about 3 million people who were in the country without legal status, bolstered border enforcement and for the first time established penalties for hiring people who were in the country illegally. [...]to win the support of industry, including the powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce and agricultural delegations from the Midwest, the employer sanctions were watered down, said Peter Brownell, research director for the Center on Policy Initiatives in San Diego, who has studied the issue. Around the same time as IRCA's passage, the federal government developed a pilot program, which later turned into E-Verify, the online system that allows employers to check whether Social Security numbers are valid and, therefore, whether an employee can work legally in the United States. In 2009, an independent review of E-Verify for the Department of Homeland Security estimated that 54% of workers approved by the system to work were in the country without authorization. [...]Operation Vanguard targeted the employers, and after more than 3,500 workers fled as word of Vanguard spread, the officials who had urged Reed to step Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, part of the new Department of Homeland Security.

Gorsuch faces partisan divide as hearing opens,"Appeals judge, who has unified GOP, gives deferential statement Judge Neil Gorsuch promised to remember the ""modest station we judges are meant to occupy in a democracy"" if he is elevated to the nation's highest court, as the hearing on his Supreme Court nomination began Monday amid Democratic doubts about his impartiality and lingering resentment over the circumstances of his selection. The day followed a familiar confirmation hearing script - glowing assessments from senators of the party whose president made the nomination, vows of scrutiny from senators out of power and a humble, deferential opening statement from the nominee. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee made clear they are not over the decision of their Republican colleagues to keep open the seat held by the late Justice Antonin Scalia for President Trump to fill it. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said the plan is for the full Senate to vote on Gorsuch by Easter, so he could be on the court for its final round of oral arguments in late April. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, started the day complaining that Republicans blocked consideration of Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's nominee to replace Scalia after the justice's death 13 months ago. In a letter sent to committee Democrats, one of his former students, Jennifer Sisk, claimed that during a conversation about work-life balance in the legal profession, Gorsuch asked students if they knew of women who had ""used a company to...",1878975614,Newspapers," Barnes, Robert

Avideh Moussavian, a staff lawyer at NILC, said police often cooperate with federal law enforcement agencies on criminal matters but emphasized that immigration violations are civil, not criminal.

Democrats Don't Want a Judicial 'Rubber Stamp;' Or Do They?,"  The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on which Judge Gorsuch sits, had held in 2005 that the Justice Department had the authority to waive a provision of immigration law requiring certain illegal immigrants to stay outside the U.S. for 10 years before applying for legal permanent resident status. With hundreds of federal agencies executing tens of thousands of pages of federal law, the line between matters of legal interpretation and matters of administrative discretion becomes critical.",1879854136,Newspapers," Cass, Ronald A

U.S. News -- Capital Account: A Senator's Plan to Reduce Legal Immigration,"  However much they quarreled over illegal immigration, political leaders in both parties used to agree that the U.S. needs more legal immigrants to sustain its aging labor force. Among Republicans, that consensus is dissolving. One dissident who bears watching is Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas. He says the U.S. admits too many legal immigrants based on family ties rather than skills, education or the ability to assimilate. Cotton and fellow Republican Sen. David Perdue have introduced a bill that would cut legal immigration in half. And while it's a low priority in Congress now, Mr. Cotton may one day influence the approach of President Donald Trump, who has also argued for less legal, and illegal, immigration. The core of Mr. Cotton's critique is that historically, immigration comes in big waves. The country struggles to assimilate the newcomers, resulting in a backlash. The last such backlash came in 1924 when the Immigration Act virtually slammed the door shut on foreign entrants, including Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Europe. Mr. Cotton believes that if Congress had tapered the influx sooner, it would have avoided the draconian restrictions of 1924.",1879857618,Newspapers," Ip, Greg

U.S. News: Judge Sides With Trump on Travel Ban,"  Donald Trump won a favorable court ruling on his revised executive order on immigration and refugees, a decision that has no immediate impact but gives the White House new ammunition as it appeals other judicial decisions that blocked his new travel restrictions. U.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga in Alexandria, Va., on Friday said Mr. Trump has broad authority over the border and likely didn't exceed those powers in his revised order, which sought to temporarily bar U.S. entry for people from six Muslim-majority countries. The order, signed March 6, also suspended the U.S. refugee program.",1880647407,Newspapers," Kendall, Brent

U.S. News: Conservative Lawmaker Shows His Influence,"  No lawmaker played a more central role in deep-sixing the Republicans' health-care bill than Rep. Mark Meadows, a previously little-known North Carolina congressman and the leader of a group of conservative lawmakers known as the House Freedom Caucus. That same influence is now being criticized by some in his own party, who say the caucus's successful effort to scuttle the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act means that Obamacare will remain in place, undermining a central pillar of Republican policy.",1880659375,Newspapers," Andrews, Natalie

U.S. News: Ryan Fails To Bridge Divide In GOP,"  Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) gave House Republicans a choice on the GOP health-care bill: take it or leave it. They left it. Their defections showed that the speaker's efforts failed to bridge the divide between House factions that has bedeviled the GOP leadership for years and helped push out Mr. Ryan's predecessor, John Boehner of Ohio.The bill's collapse could weaken Mr. Ryan's negotiating power with President Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, who has been talking regularly with Mr. Ryan, could turn more often to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who kept a low profile in the health-care debate.",1880659377,Newspapers," Peterson, Kristina

U.S. News: Sanctuary Cities to Take a Hit,"  The Trump administration said it would withhold federal criminal-justice grants from cities, counties and states that don't fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities, a first strike in the new administration's battle against so-called sanctuary cities. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday that he was reaffirming a more limited Obama-era policy that threatened to pull grants from jurisdictions that bar officials from communicating with federal agencies about immigration, and implied that more sweeping rules were coming. He also said the Justice Department would try to take back previously granted funding from places that don't comply with the communications law.",1881372642,Newspapers," Meckler, Laura

U.S. News --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Establishment Strikes Back in Recent Votes,"  It's too early to draw any definitive conclusions, and the biggest test comes next month in France's presidential vote. But in elections in the Netherlands, Australia and Germany in recent days, the forces of nationalism and populism that have been on the march across First World democracies suffered setbacks. The most recent test came over the weekend in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union struck a blow for the political establishment with a convincing victory in the state of Saarland, a good sign for the chancellor ahead of a national vote in September. The Christian Democrats' secretary-general, Peter Tauber, said voters had ""opted for stability and trustworthiness. . . . The CDU is the only force that has made clear it wouldn't work with either left- or right-wing populists.""",1881372679,Newspapers," Seib, Gerald F

U.S. News: U.S. Demands Vetting Help,"  The extreme vetting that President Donald Trump has in mind for travel to the U.S. isn't just directed at individuals applying to come here. It is aimed at entire nations. The administration is looking to compel countries around the world to cooperate on a range of issues, including sharing their citizens' criminal histories, lost passports and other information that the U.S. wants to use to evaluate visa applications, administration officials said. That begins -- but doesn't end -- with the six majority-Muslim nations singled out in this month's revised executive order. In assessing visa applications, U.S. officials check names against a range of watch lists, but those databases are only as good as the information put into them, including information from foreign governments about suspected terrorists, convicted criminals and lost passports.",1881372683,Newspapers," Meckler, Laura

How to Engineer a Trump Boom,"  With Republican efforts to replace ObamaCare in tatters, President Trump now says that he should have started with tax reform. Better late than never. With the right mix of policy to stimulate the economy, the Trump administration could realistically generate 3% to 4% growth in gross domestic product. With reduced tax rates, regulatory reform, and infrastructure investment, economic growth could hit 3% to 4% a year for the next couple of years. It will all be wasted, however, if the U.S. ends up in a 1930-style trade war. With any luck, the coming focus on tax reform -- and then on regulations and infrastructure -- will lead the Trump administration away from the idea of adding impediments to international trade.",1881386067,Newspapers," Barro, Robert J

France's Fiery Populist Courts the Elite --- Marine Le Pen seeks advice from same establishment she rails against,"  For more than a year, French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, representing the once-ostracized National Front, met with influential bankers, corporate executives and government officials to get advice on the radical changes promised by her campaign. In recent head-to-head polls, Ms. Le Pen trailed conservative candidate and former Prime Minister Francois Fillon and Emmanuel Macron, a pro-EU centrist who was a French economy minister. Ms. Le Pen has dubbed these members of France's elite ""Les Horaces,"" a reference to the poet who penned verses for the first Roman emperor. It is a measure of her rise that she has lured talent and expertise from parts of the same establishment she rails against. Under Ms. Le Pen, National Front's goal is to move from a xenophobic protest movement founded by her father into a mainstream party espousing economic nationalism.",1881439195,Newspapers," Meichtry, Stacy

America's Growing Labor Shortage,"  Demographic trends coupled with a skills mismatch have resulted in a frustrating economic paradox: Millions of workers are underemployed even as millions of jobs go unfilled. The U.S. workforce is also graying, presenting a challenge for industries that entail manual labor. Construction is ground zero in the worker shortage. Many hard-hats who lost their jobs during the recession left the labor force. Some found high-paying work in fossil fuels during the fracking boom and then migrated to renewables when oil prices tumbled. While construction has rebounded, many employed in the industry a decade ago are no longer there.",1881938180,Newspapers," Anonymous

U.S. News: Wall Lures Builder Interest --- Scores of firms list themselves for possible role in Trump's border barrier,"  More than 200 companies have expressed interest in submitting plans to help design and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, as the Trump administration seeks to fulfill a key campaign promise despite significant obstacles. The companies, whose names were published on a federal contracting website, vary widely in size and capability -- from construction giants like Kiewit Corp.to smaller, family-owned businesses. Among those interested at this early stage are more than three dozen businesses owned by minorities, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows. Roughly 13% of the companies expected to submit proposals for the wall, for example, are owned by Hispanics. Among businesses signaling interest are several major construction companies with past ties to President Donald Trump, who spent decades working with the construction industry as a real-estate developer.",1881938290,Newspapers," Frosch, Dan

U.S. News: Visa Lottery to Follow Old Rules,"  President Donald Trump ran for office promising changes to the H-1B visa program, which brings highly skilled foreign workers to the U.S. But on Monday, the government will open another round of applications using rules that have long been in place. Demand for the program grossly outstrips the supply so, as in past years, the government will use a lottery to decide which companies get them. The visas are coveted by tech companies, which have unsuccessfully lobbied Congress to increase the cap, set at 85,000. The new visas become available each year in early April. Large outsourcing firms typically scoop up a substantial share of the visas, and they have drawn scrutiny for importing foreign workers, particularly in cases where they are hired to do work once performed by Americans. Smaller companies that request just a few visas have said they have a hard time planning because of uncertainty about whether they will win any.",1881940395,Newspapers," Meckler, Laura

"Globalization Backers Face End of an Era --- Nations and companies scramble to adapt to bigger barriers to trade, finance","  After World War II, the global economy rose on a wave of trade and finance, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in developing countries and providing rich countries with cheaper goods, lucrative investments and hopes for a more peaceful planet. Critics of globalization said a slowdown in cross-border trade and finance will help ease pressure on wages of unskilled workers in wealthy nations, stem the threat of financial bubbles and reduce the influence of multinational companies in developing nations.",1881943826,Newspapers," Davis, Bob

U.S. News: Mapping Out Challenges of Building Wall,"  President Donald Trump has promised to build a wall along the 2,000-mile U.S. border with Mexico, a project that would total $21 billion, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security estimate. Only about 650 miles of the border have some sort of fencing today, and adding to that is complicated by geography, politics, landownership issues and funding. Here's a breakdown of which Southwest border-patrol sectors have the most apprehensions -- defined as an arrest of removable aliens -- versus the most or least amount of fencing. (See related graphic -- WSJ March 31, 2017) It's important to note that border security is defined by more than fencing. According to Homeland Security, manpower, communication, lights and technology all aid physical barriers.",1882350726,Newspapers," Stamm, Stephanie

Does Harvard Consider Oscar Wilde 'Marginalized'?,"  Starting next fall, English majors at Harvard will be required to take a course in authors ""marginalized for historical reasons."" Those ""reasons"" include ""racism, patriarchy and heteronormativity,"" the English Department's chairman, James Simpson, told the Harvard Crimson. Campus agitation for an identity-based curriculum is by now drearily familiar. But Harvard's recent mandate goes further, creating a new literary typology: On one side are the marginalized authors; on the other, authors who, by implication, may have benefited from ""racism, patriarchy and heteronormativity."" Academia has already furnished unlettered students with excuses aplenty to ignore the greatest works of Western civilization. Now they've got another one. The Harvard English major imposes few substantive demands: a one-semester survey spanning the millennium from 700 to 1700; a semester of poetry; a course that serves as a vehicle for immigration and postcolonial themes; and one semester of Shakespeare. After that, students are on their own, free to fill out their credits with random classes in literature, theory, creative writing, or ""related courses"" outside the English Department.",1882351665,Newspapers," Heather Mac Donald

The Weekend Interview with Ayaan Hirsi Ali: Islam's Most Eloquent Apostate,"  To regard Islam merely as a faith, ""as we would Christianity or Buddhism, is to run the risk of ignoring dawa, the activities carried out by Islamists to keep Muslims energized by a campaign to impose Shariah law on all societies -- including countries of the West."" By not fighting a war of ideas against political Islam -- or 'Islamism' -- and against those who spread that ideology in our midst, we've committed a blunder.""",1885176250,Newspapers," Varadarajan, Tunku
