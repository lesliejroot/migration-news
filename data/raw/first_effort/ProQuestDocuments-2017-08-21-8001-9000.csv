A growing number of people have been streaming north from Central America, fleeing violence and poverty in their homelands. The waves of Central Americans heading north were severely testing Mexico's border patrol in the south of the country and led to a sharp increase in the number of people applying for asylum in Mexico, with applications more than doubling from 2015 to 2016. In recognition of the troubles in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake there, American border officials allowed undocumented Haitians to enter under a humanitarian parole provision, with permission to stay for as long as three years. Most of the burden of sheltering, feeding, clothing and caring for the nonstop stream of Haitians has fallen to civil society groups and individuals, who have accused the government of doing too little too late. Advocacy and humanitarian groups in Tijuana filed a complaint this week with the National Human Rights Commission alleging that federal officials had violated the migrants' human rights ""in a widespread and repeated manner"" by failing to address the crisis.

Lowell and its many nonprofit organizations devoted to refugees and immigrant groups are haltingly coming to terms with the idea that, at least for now, the flow of refugees here could stop or slow, a startling turnaround for a city built by immigrant labor. ""Lowell has been replenished and re-energized by refugees and immigrants for generations,"" said Jeffrey Thielman, the president and chief executive of the International Institute of New England, which works with the federal government to resettle refugees in Lowell, Boston and Manchester, N.H. ""We won't feel it right away,"" Mr. Thielman said of a halt in refugees, ""but businesses will not have enough workers, and not having enough workers will inhibit Lowell's ability to grow."" Because there are so many nonprofit organizations, volunteers and government services here to support refugees, a decline in the number of refugees could lead to a withering of those support services. ""If everything's closed off for a period of time, the problem would then be figuring out how to rebuild the infrastructure to welcome people in,"" said Robert Forrant, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, whose classes include third-generation Cambodians.

In their overwhelming majority refugees are fleeing violence in their homelands, not plotting it against the United States.

The standoff with Mexico's president was the first full-blown foreign policy clash with a foreign leader of the Trump administration, and was the culmination of months of tension between the two men surrounding Mr. Trump's pledge to build the wall and renegotiate Nafta, the trade accord. On Thursday, Mr. Peña Nieto, who has long urged diplomacy in the face of Mr. Trump's disparaging comments about Mexico, canceled a meeting with the new American leader that had been scheduled for Tuesday. Like a growing number of Mexican business leaders and policy makers, Mr. Slim said that Mexico should be prepared to allow the United States to withdraw from Nafta if the Americans' demands were too high.",1862285889,Newspapers," Semple, KirkKirkKirk SempleSempleKirk Semple",,," Copyright New York Times Company Jan 28, 2017"," 982970-20170128 , 982970-20170128 , 7818 , PQ_7818_Jan282017", News," Jan 28, 2017",0362-4331, English, English, A.14," New York, N.Y.","Jan 28, 2017",New York Times,2017,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1862285889?accountid=14496,,,, A.14,," Presidents , Boundaries , International relations-US , Political leadership , Foreign policy , United States--US , Trump, Donald J , Pena Nieto, Enrique , Mexico",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=Trump+and+Mexican+President+Speak+by+Phone+Amid+Dispute+Over+Border+Wall%3A+%5BNational+Desk%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2017-01-28&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.14&amp;au=Semple%2C+Kirk&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,New York TimesAdmiration and Unease After a Week in Office,"Mr. Trump drew a torrent of criticism after pressing a series of falsehoods about voter fraud, the size of the crowd at his inauguration and his attacks on the intelligence community.

For citizens of countries including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- whose visa applications would be blocked until a new ""extreme vetting"" procedure is put in place -- the policy would separate families, keep parents from attending their children's weddings and perhaps make it tougher for green-card holders to come home to the U.S. ""Why is Trump victimizing Iranians as people?"" asked a 45-year-old engineer in Tehran, who asked that his name be withheld because he did not want to run afoul of U.S. authorities. Even before Trump signed the executive order Friday afternoon, families in the affected countries reacted to reports about a draft of the policy obtained by the Los Angeles Times and other news organizations.

The administration would be on shaky legal ground going after money allocated for anything other than law enforcement, and taking funds away from local police is a risky proposition for a president promising to restore order in the streets. Another measure moving in the state Legislature would provide lawyers to immigrants detained by federal agents, which would force federal authorities to redirect enforcement resources to litigating tedious hearings. State lawmakers are consulting former U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. and his associates -- recently hired as counsel to the Legislature -- on many of these moves, seeking their expertise on the legal constraints on federal law enforcement that they can exploit to undermine Trump.

During the city's mayoral race -- which swept Mr. Khan to power last May, with more than 1.3 million votes and the largest personal mandate of any politician in British political history -- the ""son of a Pakistani bus driver"" became, in the words of the BBC, ""one of the most hackneyed phrases of Mr. Khan's time on the stump ... so overused in his leaflets and speeches."" Sure, Britain might be going to hell in a Brexit hand basket, but Londoners had elected the first Muslim mayor of any major Western city -- the son of a Pakistani bus driver, no less -- and isn't that something?

Since 2012, he has choked through the harshest drought to hit the Great Plains in a century, punctuated by freakish snowstorms and suffocating gales of dust. [...]he is a climate change realist. Regional politicians and business leaders speak of pursuing jobs that clean energy may create, rather than pressing the need to rein in carbon emissions. A science teacher at a community college -- whose deeply religious students sometimes express doubts about the trustworthiness of science that contradicts biblical teachings -- speaks to his class about the positives of scientific discovery (electricity) in order to ease into more contentious subjects (global warming). Much of that consensus has broken down, in no small part because of a well-financed push by fossil-fuel interests, together with influential Republican allies, to attack well-established research on topics like global warming and push back on environmental regulation. President Trump has famously said he believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and his administration has purged nearly all mention of climate-change programs from the White House and State Department websites. The group has been petitioning the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.

A problem for anyone contemplating a real-life pilgrimage to the urban shrines of the Communist Party: Much of the historic city depicted on the virtual map has been wiped off the real map of Shanghai by two decades of breakneck development. The two-story rowhouse, where the future Great Helmsman once folded laundry and ate rice in an attic room, now sits between a climate-controlled luxury mall and the five-star Shangri-La Hotel's steakhouse. On the second floor of a thoroughly modern exhibition space, the Congress is commemorated in the orthodox Communist way -- with starkly lit wax figures displayed behind glass. Less picturesque complexes, though, tend to be occupied by migrant workers, many of whom lack of residency permits, which makes the future of these homes tenuous. &gt; Perhaps the quickest way to get an idea of the vitality of a traditional alleyway complex is to visit Tianzifang, a five-minute walk from the Dapuqiao station. Unlike Xintiandi's international chains, Tianzifang is home to such quirky local businesses as Pureland, which specializes in hand-painted ceramic tile images of koi ponds, pagodas and other traditional Chinese landscapes, and Teddy Bear Family, a Thai restaurant where every surface is covered with plush toys.

The executive order Mr. Trump issued on Friday, which targets Syrian refugees and all travelers from several predominantly Muslim nations, had drawn little dissent from Republicans initially even as Democrats denounced it and protests erupted around the country and the world.

By giving preference to Christians over Muslims, religious leaders have said the executive order pits one faith against another. Jen Smyers, the director of policy and advocacy for the immigration and refugee program of Church World Service, a ministry affiliated with dozens of Christian denominations, called Friday a ""shameful day"" in United States history. John and Noreen Yarwood, who attended Mass at the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph, a Catholic church in Brooklyn, said they feared that a policy of preference for Christians could in practice become a preference for certain denominations of Christianity over others. Among the claims Mr. Trump made at his campaign rallies was that the Obama administration had denied refugee status to Christians, and had given preference to Muslims. The contention was consistent with the conspiracy theories held by some conservative Christians that Mr. Obama was secretly a Muslim, and that he was turning a blind eye to the suffering of Christians while using the reins of government to increase the Muslim population of the United States.

The latest census figures from 2015 show 10,116 foreign-born Syrians living in the New York-New Jersey area, with the most in Brooklyn and in Passaic County, N.J. The older, largely professional immigrants are in contrast to the most recent refugees fleeing from smaller cities of Homs and Daraa, refugee officials say. Avigail Ziv, the International Rescue Committee's executive director for New York and New Jersey, said that the newest Syrians were growing better connected to other Arab and Muslim groups there, and had been embraced by church and synagogue volunteers. Alaaeldin M. Ahmed's grocery store in the nation's capital is about a 10-minute drive from the White House, and it sometimes seems that he could not have picked a better spot to sell halal meats, rice and spices to Sudanese expatriates. (Khartoum is the capital of Sudan, which is covered by Mr. Trump's order; South Sudan, which became independent in 2011, was not affected.) Washington and its suburbs have a larger Sudanese population than any other metro area in the United States, which has long drawn Sudanese seeking to escape their native country's political strife. According to census data, there were 147,597 foreign-born Iranians in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area in 2015.

The administration faced down another torrent of criticism Monday -- from fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill, career diplomats, national security experts and world leaders -- over the hasty rollout of the order, as well as the message it sent to both friends and adversaries in the war on terrorism. The Pentagon, with written support from Republican military veterans serving in Congress, began compiling a list of Iraqi citizens who have worked with the armed forces and is recommending that they be exempt from Trump's temporary ban on entry to the U.S. by people from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries: Despite the backlash, senior White House officials maintain that the ban is popular with Trump's voters, though no reputable polling on the question has been released since Friday. Senior GOP staff on the House and Senate judiciary committees helped write a version of the executive order on their own time during Trump's transition. The trio, who make up part of Trump's inner circle, have a dark view of refugee and immigration flows from majority-Muslim countries, believing that if large numbers of Muslims are allowed to enter the U.S., parts of American cities will begin to replicate disaffected and disenfranchised immigrant neighborhoods in France, Germany and Belgium that have been home to perpetrators of terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years.",1863527776,Newspapers," Bennett, BrianBrianBrian BennettBennettBrian Bennett , Bierman, NoahNoahNoah BiermanBiermanNoah Bierman",,, (Copyright (c) 2017 Los Angeles Times)," LATM201701312695 , LATM201701312695 , 7683 , PQ_7683_Jan312017", News," Jan 31, 2017",0458-3035, English, English, A.1," Los Angeles, Calif.","Jan 31, 2017",Los Angeles Times,2017,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1863527776?accountid=14496,,,, A.1,," Presidents , Travel , Terrorism , Advisors , National security , Muslims , Aliens , Immigration , Diplomatic & consular services"," TRUMP, DONALD J , UNITED STATES , IMMIGRATION , IMMIGRANTS , GOVERNMENT , EXECUTIVE ORDERS",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alatimes&amp;atitle=White+House+aides+see+travel+ban+as+just+a+start%3B+A+dark+view+of+immigrants+fuels+their+radical+experiment&amp;title=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;issn=04583035&amp;date=2017-01-31&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.1&amp;au=Bennett%2C+Brian%3BBierman%2C+Noah&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Los Angeles TimesUpward Mobility: What Will Trump's Immigration Ban Actually Accomplish?,"  [...]not a single American has died as a result of terrorist attacks committed by any citizen of the seven banned countries in this millennium,"" explains Lyman Stone in the Federalist.

The Canadian authorities have recorded thousands of hate-motivated crimes in recent years, but Ms. Perry said Canadian law enforcement officials have played down the threat of right-wing extremists, preferring instead to focus on Islamic terrorism. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service declined to comment on actions they have taken to monitor and stop the spread of white nationalist groups, though the intelligence service has in the past minimized the movement's influence, telling the Canadian news media that ""right-wing extremist circles appear to be fragmented and primarily pose a threat to public order and not to national security.""

For most people here, Trump's indefinite ban on the resettlement of Syrian nationals in America (as opposed to an injunction of at least four months on six other Muslim-majority countries) was further proof that the world has all but abandoned the refugees fleeing civil war. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians, desperate to flee the violence of the six-year civil war ravaging their country, have opted for a risky sea passage between Turkey and Greece en route to refugee-friendly European countries such as Germany and Sweden. Lebanon, whose population before the Syrian civil war was 4.3 million according to the World Bank, has taken in 1.1 million registered refugees -- with an estimated 400,000 more off the books -- a whopping 37% increase in its overall population.

Trump's executive order -- which blocks nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days -- is facing numerous lawsuits from civil rights groups who contend that it discriminates against Muslims, violates another provision of immigration law by targeting certain nationalities and denies due process to people who already have been vetted to enter the U.S. There are also questions about whether the order, which also keeps out refugees from around the world for 120 days and those from Syria indefinitely, actually serves its stated purpose of national security.

Rejected by most serious scholars of religion and shunned by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, this dark view of Islam has nonetheless flourished on the fringes of the American right since before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Asked about the seeming antipathy to Islam that appeared to inform the order, the White House pointed to Mr. Trump's comments in the August speech and on another occasion that signaled support for reform-minded Muslims. James Jay Carafano, a security expert at the Heritage Foundation who advised the Trump transition at the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, said the executive order was simply ""trying to get ahead of the threat.""

In the most startling shift, the White House issued an unexpected statement appealing to the Israeli government not to expand the construction of Jewish settlements beyond their current borders in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The White House has also shown no indication that it plans to rip up Mr. Obama's landmark nuclear deal, despite Mr. Trump's withering criticism of it during the presidential campaign. [...]Mr. Trump presented himself during the campaign as a stalwart supporter of Israel and criticized the Obama administration for allowing the passage of a Security Council resolution in December that condemned Israel for its expansion of settlements. Mr. Trump shifted his policy after he met briefly with King Abdullah II of Jordan on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast -- an encounter that put the king, one of the most respected leaders of the Arab world, ahead of Mr. Netanyahu in seeing the new president. The ""beyond their current borders"" phrase in the White House statement hinted at a return to a policy President George W. Bush outlined to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004, which acknowledged that it was unrealistic to expect Israel to give up its major settlements in a final deal, although they would...",1864062394,Newspapers," Landler, MarkMarkMark LandlerLandlerMark Landler , Baker, PeterPeterPeter BakerBakerPeter Baker , Sanger, David EDavidDavid E SangerSangerEDavid E.

A couple of blocks away, at the Black Tie Affair tattoo parlor, Arlene Escalante, 29, waits for the numbing cream to kick in in her arm before she gets inked.

Niles Resch, 28, an apprenticed tattoo artist, agrees. In East Hollywood, at Kaiser Permanente, David Earl Waterman, 52, is enjoying his lunch break at a cafe where employees have placed stars on a giant world map to point out their places of origin. Yet he won the electoral college vote and the election -- a fact that Waterman thinks could owe, in part, to the relative lack of ethnic diversity in some of the places where he did well.

In a hearing that lasted more than an hour, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to dismiss the administration's arguments that neither the states nor the courts had the authority to challenge the executive order, which seeks to bar travelers from seven countries in the Middle East and North Africa to protect the United States from terrorists. Trump's executive order suspending the admission of new refugees and blocking travelers from countries with possible links to terrorism prompted protests around the world and threw airports into chaos as at least 60,000 foreigners with valid visas saw them suddenly canceled. A federal judge in Seattle last week issued a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the ban, and those potentially affected by it -- students who had been overseas visiting their families, engineers on work visas, relatives hoping to visit their families in the U.S. -- began streaming into the country again. August Flentje, special counsel to the assistant U.S. attorney general, argued that Trump's order merely put a ""temporary pause"" on entry from the seven countries until security concerns could be reviewed.

Immigration -- not trade liberalization or the elimination of barriers to capital flows -- offers the best shot at raising the incomes of the poor and increasing economic output around the world. If barriers to immigration are orders of magnitude steeper than barriers to trade, removing such obstacles -- allowing workers to flock to where they are most productive -- would provide a much bigger impetus to the economy than any effort at trade liberalization. ""If trade deals were strictly about efficiency and growing the size of the overall economic pie,"" argues Dani Rodrik of the Kennedy School, ""trade negotiators would drop everything else on their agenda and spend their whole time trying to strike a bargain whereby workers from poor countries could participate in the labor markets of the rich countries."" [...]some economists have estimated that allowing free cross-border movement of labor could more than double the world's gross domestic product. George Borjas of Harvard, by no means a supporter of liberal immigration, has estimated that the newcomers who arrived in the United States from 1990 to 2010 reduced the wages of American-born high school dropouts over the long term by 3.1 percent -- or some $900 a year.

Public schools must take all comers.

""When you look at the totality -- we've issued 25, plus or minus, executive actions, nominated a Supreme Court justice,"" Sean Spicer, White House press secretary, said in an interview. Presidents eventually figure out they need to shift power away from campaign aides who helped them win election in favor of experts in government who can craft policy and manage the bureaucracy more effectively, said Elaine Kamarck, a former aide in the Clinton White House who writes about the office of the presidency. Yet hours after he moderated on China, he refreshed his attack on the judiciary in unusually personal terms, calling the appeals court ruling ""disgraceful"" on Twitter. Trump advisors who pushed for the travel ban said they were not deterred by Thursday's decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which some expected to lose. Trump's court setback has emboldened Democrats, who are still trying to emerge from a devastating election that saw them surrender White House control to the GOP.

Once there, she said, she found onerous working conditions and lower-than-promised pay. Technically 'Training' Ms. Liu and other Chinese workers at her factory came to Japan through a government-sponsored internship program.

""The system is like calling a crow white,"" said Yoshio Kimura, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who heads the party's labor committee. There are also students in part-time jobs, asylum seekers waiting for refugee applications to be processed -- almost all are ultimately rejected -- and South Americans of Japanese descent who can obtain special visas based on their ancestry. Eventually, Japan plans to lengthen the maximum time that trainees can stay in the country to five years, from three, and allow more kinds of businesses to hire them, including nursing homes and cleaning companies for offices and hotels.

Mr. Basuki's brash political style -- he is on trial on blasphemy allegations after making polarizing remarks about the Quran -- has led some prominent Chinese-Indonesians to denounce him for disrupting Indonesia's delicate ethnic balance. For three decades during the Suharto years, Chinese-Indonesians were accused of being in league with the Chinese government and forbidden to study at Chinese-language schools or publicly celebrate Chinese holidays. After Suharto, the authoritarian president, fell in 1998, anti-Chinese riots swept cities throughout Sumatra and Java Island, after provocateurs blamed Chinese business interests for Indonesia's economic crisis. Among the claims are that the Chinese government has announced it will invade Indonesia to protect Chinese-Indonesians, and that China is poisoning Indonesians by exporting contaminated chili seeds. Christine Susanna Tjhin, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the fake news might be intended to target Chinese-Indonesians even though a majority ""are actually quite disconnected from mainland Chinese,"" in part because of decades of Suharto government assimilation policies.

In Arab towns, the government has made building permits so difficult to obtain, and grants them so rarely, that many inhabitants have resorted to constructing new housing units on their properties without permits just to keep up with growing families that have nowhere else to go. [...]Arab communities have become more and more densely populated, turning pastoral villages into concrete jungles. Several weeks ago, when it became clear that the government would be forced to implement an Israeli High Court ruling to evacuate Amona, an illegal settlement in the occupied West Bank built on land stolen from Palestinians, Mr. Netanyahu vowed to destroy Arab homes throughout Israel in retribution.

After being stopped by the immigration authorities, some detainees have come to learn that they may be eligible for asylum, either through word of mouth from other detainees or during screenings with immigration officials. ""Many come here not knowing that the experiences they've had fit perfectly with asylum,"" said Javier Martínez Hernández, a lawyer at Casa del Migrante, which helped more than 100 migrants apply for refugee status in 2016, more than double the number in 2015. In the past year, the Mexican government has made a number of improvements to its asylum system, including increasing its staff and modifying the screening process to ensure that eligible migrants have a chance to apply, officials said. The Mexican authorities have also begun releasing asylum seekers from detention while they await the resolution of their cases, a process that often takes three or more months, and have improved applicants' access to humanitarian aid and psychological and legal counseling, advocates said.

In years past, Mr. de Blasio used the annual speech to push big-impact campaign promises of universal prekindergarten, the construction of thousands of units of affordable housing, and infrastructure initiatives like a major expansion of ferry service and a light rail line along the Brooklyn and Queens waterfront. In Monday's speech, Mr. de Blasio appeared content to offer repackaged or slightly expanded versions of programs that have thus far defined his administration, demonstrating the shift in a mayor who once saw himself as a promoter of high-minded ideas and a national progressive leader but has repeatedly encountered limitations in the day-to-day grind of running a big city. In addressing affordable housing, Mr. de Blasio said that he would expand an existing program to provide lawyers to poor New Yorkers facing eviction in Housing Court and that he would dedicate more affordable housing units than he had previously proposed for New Yorkers earning less than $40,000 a year. To drive the point home further, a few hours before his speech, he announced that he was renaming the 115th Street library in Harlem after Harry Belafonte, an actor, singer and civil...",1867807311,Newspapers," Neuman, WilliamWilliamWilliam NeumanNeumanWilliam Neuman , Goodman, J DavidJJ David GoodmanGoodmanDavidJ.

I asked Del Bosque when I visited him Monday in his office, a modest double-wide trailer on the edge of an almond orchard off Interstate 5. Del Bosque's water comes from the Central Valley Project, run by the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which provides much of the water consumed by farms and people in the Central Valley. Even though this year has brought a record amount of rain and a boffo snowpack, he thinks he will get shorted again at the end of this month when the feds determine 2018 water allocations. Last year, Del Bosque was able to find some water districts willing to part with water at a steep $1,000 to $1,300 per acre-foot.) He estimates that he has more than a million dollars worth of water sitting in the San Luis right now. Due to the complexities of water law, the federal government then has the right to take ownership of the farmers' expensive water.

Complaints like these are being logged by a Twitter account called @Trump_Regrets. Since November, the account, managed by Erica Baguma, a 23-year-old Canadian college student, has climbed to more than 220,000 followers by curating some 1,500 messages, mostly from exasperated people who claimed to have voted for Mr. Trump. Some of the messages are sent from people hiding behind Pepe the Frog avatars, a mascot of alt-right trolls and a designated hate symbol, or faceless egg avatars. With this in mind, The New York Times reached out to a dozen people whose messages were shared by the account, and checked their names against public records, including activity on other social media platforms. Jon A. Krosnick Jon A. Krosnick, a professor at Stanford University who studies the psychology of voting, said that he was struck by how many of the Trump Regrets messages seemed to focus on Mr. Trump's brash leadership style over his policies.

Last week, a federal-appeals court ruling stayed parts of the executive order, lifting the immigration and travel bans and restarting the flow of refugees. The department's filing came in the San Francisco-based Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel last week ruled the executive order couldn't be implemented because it went too far in limiting travelers to the U.S. Ben Kesling in Erbil, Iraq contributed to this article.

The deliberations show the challenge the administration faces as it tries to reconcile the competing goals of cutting taxes, boosting military and infrastructure spending, preserving Medicare and Social Security programs and keeping budget deficits from soaring. A fast-growing economy produces more revenue while reducing the need for spending on programs such as food stamps or unemployment insurance. The forecasts, which were initiated before President Donald Trump took office, project gross domestic product--a broad measure of national output of goods and services--growing between 3% and 3.5% a year over the coming decade, with inflation-adjusted annual growth ultimately settling at around 3.2% during the later years of the 10-year forecast. Many economists believe sustained growth at more than 3% will be difficult to achieve without a sharp rebound in productivity growth and a reversal in the slowing expansion of the U.S. labor force, developments few are projecting. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates deficit reduction, said Mr. Trump's policies to boost spending on the military and to cut taxes are likely to increase deficits.",1869246414,Newspapers," Timiraos, NickNickNick TimiraosTimiraosNick Timiraos",," Congress921120 , Congressional Budget Office--CBO921120"," (c) 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

After the British consul in Charleston requested the man's extradition for court-martial, U.S. Secretary of State Timothy Pickering and President John Adams determined that this was a simple case of mutiny and murder on a British ship. Republicans launched a congressional investigation in February 1800 and only a largely party-line vote protected Adams from official censure by Congress. Mr. Ekirch shows how the Robbins controversy helped create one of the most polarized presidential elections in American history. Fury over the Robbins extradition helped Republicans win close elections in several states, giving the majority of the electoral college to Jefferson.

But their connection to one factory job embodies the massive economic shift that has accompanied the rise of free trade.","In the United States, that shift has contributed to the loss of jobs that once helped workers buy homes, pay for health insurance and send children to college. Nobody disputes that the loss of manufacturing has left a bruise in parts of the U.S., especially in places like the Rust Belt, where lower-paying service industry jobs are increasingly replacing middle class factory positions. The period of steepest decline in manufacturing jobs, which fell from 17 million to 11 million between 2000 and 2010, is substantially attributable to the free import of goods manufactured more cheaply in China and increasing reliance on machines to do the jobs humans once did, according to Gordon Hanson, an economist and trade expert at UC San Diego. South of the border, free trade has indeed helped modernize Mexico by creating millions of jobs since the passage of NAFTA, boosting investment flow and helping to diversify the country's manufacturing sector. [...]wages have remained low, so that Mexico remains attractive to manufacturers who might otherwise be tempted to locate in China or elsewhere in Asia. Since NAFTA went into effect, there has been no change in the number of Mexicans living below the poverty line -- more than half.

When California dammed the Feather River as part of its monumental project to bring water to Southern California and other parts of the state, the river became more predictable, but not totally so. Though most orchard growers here don't directly draw from the river, they still survive on it. Because the state water project continued to direct the Feather River water down its historical course, the river replenishes the aquifer as it always has. A family of deer picked delicately over the bank and into the orchards' safety, as one of Johl's workers tried to fix a valve in the levee that the farm needed for the land to drain. At the southern end of the project, Feather River water pours out of a 28-mile-long pipeline into the Lake Perris reservoir, more than 500 miles from its source and nearly 700 feet higher in elevation. In 2005, the state Department of Water Resources discovered that parts of the foundation might be at risk during an earthquake and ordered the water lowered by 25 feet.

Economists theorize that migration is primarily a function of labor supply and demand. [...]wages, too, are dependent on the supply and demand for workers. During the past few decades, Mexico's labor supply has been large relative to the U.S., especially for jobs Americans didn't much want to do, such as agricultural field work and some kinds of construction. Part of the reason for that perception is the fact that the supply of labor in Mexico is dwindling and wages are rising there.
