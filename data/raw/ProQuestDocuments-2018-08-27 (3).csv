Durbin (D-Ill.) have introduced legislation that would allow Trump to essentially keep his promise to end Obama's executive action while also creating a new, similar program that would allow young immigrants to remain temporarily in the U.S. The so-called Bridge Act would give DACA-eligible young people ""provisional protected presence"" for three years, providing work permits and deferring deportations if they continue to be law-abiding.",1849116056,Newspapers," Mascaro, Lisa

U.S. could be the next Argentina,"  Up until recently, Argentina had spent most of the past 100 years alternating between left-wing populists who promised to share the country's wealth and right-wing military dictatorships that tried to stop that from happening. [...]left-wing governments just nationalized industries, protected others with tariffs and made promises they could afford only by printing money. The irony, of course, is that even when Argentina did open up its economy and try to cure its congenital inflation in the 1990s, the way it did so - pegging the peso to the dollar one-to-one - made it unable to respond to even the smallest shock.",1852904127,Newspapers," O'Brien, Matt

Murray Snow, off his case for an appeal.","  The Joe and Murray Show, the high-stakes, long-running rivalry between an Arizona sheriff and federal judge, has chosen a federal appeals court as its new backdrop for an eighth year that has turned ugly and increasingly personal. Since 2009, Arizonans have watched the drama play out between Joe Arpaio, 84, and U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow, 57. After reviewing Arpaio's treatment of Latino drivers in massive stings targeting immigrants in the country illegally, Snow deemed Arpaio's application of justice ""unfair, partial and inequitable,"" and found the sheriff broke the law in failing to carry out a 2011 court order to refrain from bias against minorities.",1855261231,Newspapers," Duara, Nigel

The wrong and right business lessons for schools,"  Socioeconomic segregation had intensified, the academic achievement gap among disadvantaged children and their middle- and upper-class peers persisted, for-profit school management provoked protest and reform, and teacher pay remained low.

One Reince to rule them all,"  All of this means that the 44-year-old Priebus will be at the center of an experiment to determine whether Trump's singular style of leadership -- honed in his family business, displayed on reality television and used with devastating effect in a presidential campaign that defied every expectation -- will transform Washington as Trump promised or prove ineffective when applied to the more complex work of presiding over the massive federal government. In his White House, an array of people, some with strong personalities, are expected to have coveted walk-in privileges to bring their viewpoints directly to the Oval Office. Besides Bannon and Kushner, this will probably include counselor Kellyanne Conway, policy adviser Stephen Miller, national security adviser Michael Flynn and counterterrorism adviser Thomas Bossert.",1856220025,Newspapers," Tumulty, Karen

Trump riles Chicago brass,"  Members of Chicago's political class got a crash course Wednesday on how President Donald Trump will govern, as they fretted over an executive order on immigration that could cost the city millions in federal funding and scrambled to respond to a Twitter threat to ""send in the feds"" to fix the city's gun violence. Trump directed Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to work with incoming Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ensure sanctuary cities ""are not eligible to receive federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes.""",1861777904,Newspapers," Ruthhart, Bill

NAFTA under threat; Trump's rift with the president of Mexico over border wall sets off worries about future of the 23-year-old trade pact,"  Trump had threatened during the campaign to walk away from NAFTA and to impose tariffs of 35% on Mexican goods coming into the U.S. On Thursday, the White House proposed a complicated 20% tax on sales by U.S. companies of imported goods from Mexico and other nations to help pay for the wall. Since his election, Trump and top economic officials have spoken frequently about their desire to renegotiate the 23-year-old pact, which many people across the political spectrum believe needs to be revised and updated.",1862029173,Newspapers," Lee, Don

Terrified of Mexican competition, he considers slapping a 20 percent tariff on Mexican goods, even though U.S. exports to Mexico have increased 97 percent since 2005.",1862030414,Newspapers," Brooks, David

"In immigration fight, law may side with state; Stripping funding from 'sanctuary cities' may prove difficult.","The executive order Trump issued Wednesday putting cities and counties on notice that they would lose federal funding if they didn't start cooperating with immigration agents has broad implications for California, a state that aggressively protects its undocumented population from deportation. The administration would be on shaky legal ground going after money allocated for anything other than law enforcement, and taking funds away from local police is a risky proposition for a president promising to restore order in the streets. Another measure moving in the state Legislature would provide lawyers to immigrants detained by federal agents, which would force federal authorities to redirect enforcement resources to litigating tedious hearings. State lawmakers are consulting former U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. and his associates -- recently hired as counsel to the Legislature -- on many of these moves, seeking their expertise on the legal constraints on federal law enforcement that they can exploit to undermine Trump. The complaints could point to the 2012 Supreme Court decision on Obamacare that restricted the federal government's ability to force states to expand Medicaid, finding that the federal government cannot coerce a state to enact a policy by threatening its funding, or in the...",1862499054,Newspapers," Halper, Evan

Thankfully, May publicly answered that question in a way that all conservatives can understand when she said, ""If you think about it, any leader, any government, as we do here in the United Kingdom when we look at any issue, we ensure that we're putting the U.K.'s interests and the interest of British people first.""
