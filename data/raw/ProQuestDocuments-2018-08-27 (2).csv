Rural Vote Fuels Trump; Clinton Loses Urban Grip; Divisions persist in the electorate that have been in place for years,"  WASHINGTON--The race for the White House turned into a neck-and-neck contest largely because Donald Trump was running up wide margins in rural and blue-collar parts of the country, while Hillary Clinton showed a weakened hold on the major, urban areas where Democrats traditionally score big. Mr. Trump magnified his opponent's problem by defying expectations that his support among minority groups would collapse, due to his disparaging remarks about illegal immigrants from Mexico and proposal to ban the entry of Muslims to the U.S. Instead, Mr. Trump was on track to claim a larger share of minority voters than had Mitt Romney, the GOP nominee in 2012.",1837126850,Newspapers," Zitner, Aaron

The Harris-Sanchez contest was the first major test of California's top-two primary system, an experiment in democracy that state voters approved in 2010 in an effort to temper the highly partisan influence of the Democratic and Republican parties and give independents and moderates more clout in the political process.",1837152698,Newspapers," Willon, Phil

Tech Stocks Miss Out on Trump Bump --- Sector joins Tuesday's rise but is down 1.8% since Election Day; Dow at another record,"  Mr. Trump called out Apple Inc. on the campaign trail in February, for instance, saying consumers should boycott the company after Apple refused to help the U.S. government unlock a killer's iPhone. Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., said Mr. Trump's immigration plans as president could affect visa programs, making it more difficult for engineering and other tech talent to work in the U.S. Trade limits also could hurt big technology companies that derive a large percentage of their revenues overseas, he said, particularly for companies with large cross-border commerce such as Facebook and Amazon.com.",1839486580,Newspapers," Driebusch, Corrie

"Some garment makers earn just $4 an hour; Labor Department investigation finds that independent suppliers for firms such as Forever 21, Ross paid less than minimum wage","  Forever 21 is one of several companies that have been supplied by independent Southern California factories that pay workers much less than the state minimum wage, the Labor Department announced Wednesday. Rosalez said the retailers hire monitors to make sure their suppliers abroad are following the law but don't do the same level of inspection in the U.S. That has fueled more wage theft in Southern California over the last decade, as retailers try to put a lid on their prices while the minimum wage rises across the state, he said.",1840607664,Newspapers," Kitroeff, Natalie

If current trends continue, Pew predicts, the absolute number of first-generation immigrants will rise still further in the next five decades, to 78.2 million, and the immigrant share of the population will surge to a record high 17.7%.",1842415849,Newspapers," Galston, William A

Donald Trump Selects Donald McGahn as White House Counsel; President-elect also picks Kathleen Troia 'KT' McFarland as deputy national security adviser,"  President-elect Donald Trump on Friday selected Donald McGahn, his chief campaign attorney, to join him in the White House as his top lawyer, sliding the longtime election-law expert into what promises to be a high-profile job with unique challenges in the next administration. ""The White House counsel tends to be responsible for ethics, compliance with those standards, opening on the constitutionality of legislation and executive orders, and vetting appointments,"" Mr. McGahn said Friday in a brief interview, adding that he expects to be tasked with that ""standard portfolio.""",1843173236,Newspapers," Bender, Michael C

Immigrants fear a wider definition of 'criminal'; Minor offenders worry about deportation under Trump,"  According to enforcement policies set by the Department of Homeland Security in 2014, minor traffic offenses and any crime for which an essential element is immigration status are excluded and do not make a person eligible for deportation. According to two senior officials in his transition team, Trump's advisors will try to widen the deportation net to include migrants who have been charged but not convicted, suspected gang members and drug dealers, and people charged with such immigration violations as illegal reentry and overstaying visas, as well as lower-level misdemeanors.",1843212963,Newspapers," Carcamo, Cindy

Startups wary of Trump's plans on immigration,"  In the current immigration vision detailed on Trump's presidential campaign website, he vows to deport millions of immigrants, curtail foreign worker visas and ensure that open jobs are offered to Americans first. In August, the Department of Homeland Security proposed an International Entrepreneur Rule that, if passed, could grant qualifying foreign entrepreneurs a temporary stay for at least two years and up to a three-year extension to oversee and scale their startup in the U.S. The department is reviewing public comments before it rules on the measure.\n",1844275606,Newspapers," MacArthur, Kate

Internment was wrong in 1942 -- and it's wrong now,"  The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California represented him before the U.S. Supreme Court, challenging the policy of roundups and incarceration. Federal District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel wrote in her 1984 opinion overturning Korematsu's conviction: ""In times of international hostility and antagonisms our institutions, legislative, executive and judicial, must be prepared to exercise their authority to protect all citizens from the petty fears and prejudices that are so easily aroused.""",1844554867,Newspapers," Takei, Carl

Tweet lights a fire on flag desecration debate,"  To undo that ruling, Congress would have to pass a constitutional amendment that would limit the First Amendment -- something that a group of lawmakers tries each year without success, according to Edwin C. Yohnka, spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. ""Because of the Supreme Court's ruling, you can't simply pass a law and you can't do an executive order. In Illinois, an antiquated statute that matches the wording of the statute used in the Texas v. Johnson case remains on the books. Because of this, local law enforcement agencies occasionally arrest flag-burners while citing the statute.",1844555015,Newspapers," Eltagouri, Marwa

Do Illegal Votes Decide Elections? There's no way to know. But the evidence suggests that significant numbers of noncitizens cast ballots.,"  Political correctness has squelched probes of noncitizen voting, so most cases are discovered accidentally instead of through a systematic review of election records. The Trump administration should direct the Department of Homeland Security to cooperate with states that want to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Since this will only flag illegal immigrants who have been detained at some point and legal noncitizens, states should pass laws, similar to the one in Kansas, that require proof of citizenship when registering to vote.",1844750691,Newspapers," Hans von Spakovsky; John Fund

"The Year Populism Went Mainstream; In regard to trade and immigration, words like 'nationalism' are no longer taboo.","  Speaking in Washington, D.C., on Monday at a convention of No Labels, a bipartisan organization that promotes cooperation between the political parties to achieve core national goals, Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci argued that in the wake of World War II the U.S. built an international architecture designed to promote global economic recovery and market economies' ability to resist pressure from the Soviet Union. When nearly all the founding members of the European Union exercised their right to slow immigration from former communist bloc countries, the New Labour government did not--a decision that Mr. Blair's principal EU adviser has defended on moral and geopolitical rather than economic grounds.",1846141081,Newspapers," Galston, William A

Since the church converted the basement into a theater space in 2006, Gillani and Khoury have produced more than 70 plays, readings, video plays and panel discussions, many of which explore being Muslim, Asian or Middle Eastern in America.",1847773237,Newspapers," Pashman, Manya Brachear

John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said GMD's track record showed that the goal of intercepting and destroying long-range ballistic missiles in flight -- a feat likened to hitting one speeding bullet with another -- was impractical.",1848009146,Newspapers," Willman, David
