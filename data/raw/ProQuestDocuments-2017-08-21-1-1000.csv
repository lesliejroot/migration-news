What's Your Consumption Factor?,"Jared Diamond, a professor of geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, is the author of ''Collapse'' and ''Guns, Germs and Steel.'' Per capita consumption rates in China are still about 11 times below ours, but let's suppose they rise to our level. Let's also make things easy by imagining that nothing else happens to increase world consumption -- that is, no other country increases its consumption, all national populations (including China's) remain unchanged and immigration ceases. China's catching up alone would roughly double world consumption rates. Oil consumption would increase by 106 percent, for instance, and world metal consumption by 94 percent. Real sacrifice wouldn't be required, however, because living standards are not tightly coupled to consumption rates. Much American consumption is wasteful and contributes little or nothing to quality of life. For example, per capita oil consumption in Western Europe is about half of ours, yet Western Europe's standard of living is higher by any reasonable criterion, including life expectancy, health, infant mortality, access to medical care, financial security after retirement, vacation time, quality of public schools and support for the arts.

Let It Start Now,"We don't question the enthusiasm or the commitment of the people of Iowa and New Hampshire. But Iowa, where a huge turnout amounts to less than 10 percent of the population, is about 92 percent white, more rural and older than the rest of the nation. New Hampshire has a non-Hispanic white population of about 95 percent. Iowa's Democrats are more liberal and more protectionist than the nation's Democrats. Its Republicans are more conservative, and religiously driven, than the nation's Republicans. And yet, The Boston Globe reported that Mr. [Romney] spent $7 million on ads in Iowa. That's nearly $4 per registered voter. Fear often appears to be the only plank on which Mr. [Rudolph Giuliani], the former mayor of New York, is standing, when you can tell where he is standing at all. Mr. Giuliani, who parlayed the 9/11 tragedy into a lucrative business and now speaks, bizarrely, of the ''9/11 generation,'' has switched his views a dizzying number of times -- on immigration, on abortion, on New York. Mr. [John Edwards] has a strong populist message, but it sounds a bit odd coming from a former tort lawyer and hedge fund executive who ran as a completely different person in 2004. One of his ads features an out-of-work Maytag employee who said Mr. Edwards promised his 7-year-old son: ''I'm going to keep fighting for your daddy's job.'' We're still waiting for Mr. Edwards to explain how he, or any politician, can turn back the tide of economics and globalization. We'd prefer if he explained how to make it work for all Americans.",433772372,Newspapers,, NYTIAO,," Copyright New York Times Company Jan 4, 2008"," 1407406231 , 38003201 , 7818 , NYTIAO , NYT , 158399-20080104", Editorial," Jan 4, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, A.18," New York, N.Y.",4-Jan-08,New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433772372?accountid=14496,,,, A.18,," Editorials , Presidential elections , Primaries & caucuses , Electoral reform , United States , US",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=Let+It+Start+Now%3A+%5BEditorial%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-01-04&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.18&amp;au=&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,New York Times

"In Global Battle On AIDS, Bush Creates Legacy","''He said, 'I will hold you accountable, because this is a big move, this is an important thing that I've been thinking about for a long time,''' recalled Dr. [Jean W. Pape], one of several international AIDS experts Mr. [Laura Bush] consulted. ''We indicated to him that our arms are totally broken as physicians, knowing that there are things we could do if we had the drugs.'' Dr. [Alex Coutinho] said Ugandans were terrified that when Mr. Bush left office, ''the Bush fund,'' as they call it, would go with him. ''When I've traveled in the U.S., I'm amazed at how little people know about what Pepfar stands for,'' he said. ''Just because it has been done under Bush, it is not something the country should not be proud of.'' The story of how a conservative Republican president became a crusader against global AIDS is an unlikely one. Mr. Bush ran for the White House in 2000 with what Joshua B. Bolten, his chief of staff, calls ''a Republican's skepticism about the efficacy of foreign aid.'' He talked of letting ''Africa solve Africa's problems.''

"Across America, Deadly Echoes of Foreign Battles","The troubles and exploits of the returning war veteran represent a searing slice of reality. They have served as a recurring artistic theme throughout history -- from Homer's ''Odyssey'' to the World War I novel ''All Quiet on the Western Front,'' from the post-Vietnam-era movie ''The Deer Hunter'' to last fall's film ''In the Valley of Elah.'' Mr. [Seth Strasburg] had never been screened for post-traumatic stress disorder. Like many soldiers, he did not take seriously the Army's mental health questionnaires given out at his tour's end. ''They were retarded,'' he said. ''All of us were like, 'Let's do this quickly so we can go home.' They asked: 'Did you see any dead bodies? Did you take part in any combat operations?' Come on, we were in Iraq. They didn't even ask us the really important question, if you killed someone.'' At the sentencing hearing in Broken Bow, Neb., in September 2006, however, the judge discounted the centrality of the PTSD. He called Mr. Varney ''the epitome of an innocent victim'' and Mr. Strasburg ''a bully'' who ''misconstrued comments'' and ''reacted in a belligerent and hostile manner.''

No G.O.P. Anchor in Sight,"''The problem for the Republicans is they all have part of it,'' said Lou Cannon, the [Ronald Reagan] biographer, referring to the conservative movement. ''[Mike Huckabee] has the social conservative part of it. Reagan had a lot of draw among independents, and [John McCain] has stepped into that. And you have the conservative Wall Street types who are with [Romney].'' In Iowa, Mr. Huckabee outflanked him, picking off social conservatives in big numbers suspicious of Mr. Romney's changes in positions over the years. But Mr. Huckabee has been hammered by another part of the old coalition -- economic conservatives -- upset over his record of raising taxes and spending while governor of Arkansas. Indeed, the Club for Growth, one of Mr. Huckabee's biggest tormentors over his record on taxes, issued a statement nine minutes after the polls closed Tuesday headlined, ''Huckabee Loses in Michigan, Taxpayers Win.'' ''I think McCain is the one guy in this race who can recreate the Reagan coalition and draw in independents,'' said Mark McKinnon, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain who was media adviser to Mr. [Bush] in 2000 and 2004.",433764217,Newspapers," Nagourney, AdamAdamAdam NagourneyNagourneyAdam Nagourney", NYTIAO," Republican Party813940"," Copyright New York Times Company Jan 16, 2008"," 1413329121 , 38111201 , 7818 , NYTIAO , NYT , 384194-20080116", News," Jan 16, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, A.1," New York, N.Y.",16-Jan-08,New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433764217?accountid=14496,,,, A.1,," Political analysis , Presidential elections , Primaries & caucuses , Michigan , Romney, W Mitt , McCain, John , Huckabee, Mike",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=No+G.O.P.+Anchor+in+Sight%3A+%5BNews+Analysis%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-01-16&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.1&amp;au=Nagourney%2C+Adam&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,New York Times
Solving a Riddle Wrapped in a Mystery Inside a Cookie,"The idea that fortune cookies come from Japan is counterintuitive, to say the least. ''I am surprised,'' said Derrick Wong, the vice president of the largest fortune cookie manufacturer in the world, Wonton Food, based in Brooklyn. ''People see it and think of it as a Chinese food dessert, not a Japanese food dessert,'' he said. But, he conceded, ''The weakest part of the Chinese menu is dessert.'' A character in one of the tales is an apprentice in a senbei store. In Japan, the cookies are called, variously, tsujiura senbei (''fortune crackers''), omikuji senbei (''written fortune crackers''), and suzu senbei (''bell crackers''). That sentiment is echoed among some descendants of the Japanese immigrants who played an early role in fortune cookies. ''If the family had decided to sell fortune cookies, they would have never done it as successfully as the Chinese have,'' said Douglas Dawkins, the great-great-grandson of [Makoto Hagiwara]. ''I think it's great. I really don't think the fortune cookie would have taken off if it hadn't been popularized in such a wide venue.''",433767299,Newspapers," Jennifer 8. LeeJennifer 8.

They've Got Those Mekong Blues Again,"Now Dengue Fever is starting to make its mark far from its hometown. The band recently returned from the Womex world music festival in Seville, Spain, where it was one of a handful of acts to play showcase performances. British publications have included it in ''next big thing'' roundups, and Dengue Fever's songs have been on television and film soundtracks, including Jim Jarmusch's ''Broken Flowers.'' A new documentary, ''Sleepwalking Through the Mekong,'' that follows the group on its first trip as a band to Cambodia, seems likely to gain it further notice. (It plays the Mercury Lounge on the Lower East Side on March 4, and at Southpaw in Brooklyn on March 5.) Dmitri Vietze, a publicist and marketer for many global music acts, sees the band as ''part of a larger developmental pattern'' in world music. ''Can you stick them in the world-music bin at brick and mortar retail stores?'' Mr. Vietze asked. ''I don't know. But as far as how they fit into world music in a larger philosophical context, they are a part of a huge and promising future.'' He noted that the American market had been introduced to world sounds most often by American artists who love and emulate them, like Paul Simon.

"Tony Soprano? No, Here's the Real Italy","''Since 2003, we've had a lot of coming and going to Parma at Montclair State -- artists, musicians. Many wonderful relationships developed,'' said Nancy Goldring, a Manhattan artist and drawing professor. Ms. Goldring's mixed-media work, which grew out of an invitation to be part of a citywide art project in Parma five years ago, will be shown in ''An Italian Sense of Place II,'' an exhibition that opens Feb. 19 at Montclair State's George Segal Gallery; other artists in the show include the late Luigi Ghirri, whose iconic photos of 1970s Italy will also be shown at the Aperture Gallery in Manhattan in February. ''When I was looking at this, the idea of an Italian sense of identity was very interesting to me,'' Ms. Cunningham said. ''We have people who identify themselves as Italian'' -- one-third of Montclair State students do so, she said -- ''but they're very different than Italians. It's a subject many people want to learn about.''

Sounds and Flavors of a Land Left Behind,"After strolling into the crowd and weaving around the cabaret-style tables to take a poll of people's homelands (Cuba, followed by Spain, Brazil, Colombia and the Dominican Republic), Albita sang a passionate tribute to her own land: ''Que culpa tengo yo estas caderas? Que culpa tengo yo este sabor? Que culpa tengo yo haber nacido en Cuba?'' (''What fault of mine are these hips? What fault of mine is this flavor? What fault of it is mine that I was born in Cuba?'') By the end of the song, the entire house had joined in, erupting with extra gusto along with the final chant of ''Cuba! Cuba!'' punctuated by Albita's fist pumping into the air. ''Calle Ocho is everything,'' said Raul Musibay, one of the ''Three Guys From Miami'' whose Web site (www.icuban.com) and cookbook ''Three Guys From Miami Cook Cuban'' strive to bring the Cuban side of the city to the masses.

''You will find more restaurants from other countries there now, just as you'll find Cubans all over Miami,'' he said. ''But Calle Ocho is the place.'' Between bites, Ms. [Mabel Castro] said that while Miami's Latino community has indeed been diversified with Central and South Americans over the years, Cubans still feel special.

Crist, who as a state lawmaker earned the respect of many Florida conservatives for sponsoring tough anti-crime measures such as the adoption of prisoner chain gains, suggested in an interview that his popularity on that front might have rubbed off on the Arizona senator.",422178635,Newspapers," Wallsten, PeterPeterPeter WallstenWallstenPeter Wallsten",," Republican Party813940", (Copyright (c) 2008 Los Angeles Times)," 1420682481 , 38231461 , 7683 , ANGE , LATM080005396", News," Jan 30, 2008",0458-3035, English, English, A.1," Los Angeles, Calif.",30-Jan-08,Los Angeles Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/422178635?accountid=14496,,,, A.1,," Candidates , Political campaigns , Nominations , Presidential elections , Florida , McCain, John",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alatimes&amp;atitle=NEWS+ANALYSIS%3B+GOP+could+have+its+unifier%3B+McCain+gets+support+from+all+corners+of+the+party+base.+It+may+be+a+new+type+of+coalition.&amp;title=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;issn=04583035&amp;date=2008-01-30&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.1&amp;au=Wallsten%2C+Peter&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Los Angeles Times
"Disillusioned With Republicans, and Disappointed in the Alternatives","''We have nobody representing us,'' he continued, adding that he was ''sad to say'' he had voted previously for Mr. [Bush]. He was considering sitting out this election altogether. ''Anyone but Obama-Osama,'' he said, chuckling at a designation that met with mirthful approval at the table. ''Ain't none of the Republicans got me jumping up and down,'' said Ken Sumner, 58, who manages Ken's River View Cafe in High Falls, Ga. ''[John McCain], I think he's a good man. I think he means good. I really don't know if he has the energy to be president.''

Bellwether State Fervently Seeks Choice Who Can Win in the Fall,"''Many I've talked to are getting caught up in this 'he's not electable' mindset, so I don't know how this is going to come out in the end,'' the Rev. Scott Weldon, pastor of Faith Southern Baptist in Marshfield, said of Mr. [Mike Huckabee], whose bumper sticker is affixed to Mr. Weldon's truck and who gets a regular mention in his blog. In Edgar Springs, a rural town known for its census designation in 2000 as the approximate mean center point of the nation's population, Les VanNote, 51, a construction worker, said he had heard questions from his work mates about whether the nation ''is ready'' for either Democrat. ''That's what everyone's asking, but myself -- I say, we shall see.'' Senator [Claire McCaskill] has said she worries that Missouri voters might be unwilling to back Mrs. Clinton in the fall. [Alex Gilbert] is leaning toward Senator [Hillary Rodham Clinton]. ''She's not afraid of ruffling some feathers,'' he said. Les VanNote of Edgar Springs, Mo., said that while some people were unsure whether the nation was ready for either of the top two Democratic candidates, ''I say, we shall see.'' [Dan Shelton] wants a Democrat capable of handling the issues of the day, but also says, ''I am interested in someone who is electable -- now it is a matter of figuring out who that really is.''

From the Housing Market To the Maternity Ward,"''It's something a bunch of us have been thinking about,'' said Morris A. Davis, an assistant professor of real estate and urban land economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Business. ''If you reduce down-payment constraints, more people can buy homes, or buy bigger homes. Does that encourage them to have more kids? I would say nobody knows.'' Several population specialists emphasized that housing is just one influence on fertility, and difficult to tease out from other factors, like income or optimism. ''If you lower the cost of housing, you're going to lower the cost of raising a child,'' said Seth Sanders, director of the Maryland Population Research Center at the University of Maryland. ''But if you look at how much it costs to raise a child, only one-third of the cost is housing. So my guess is that the impact is not very large.'' Ms. [Stephanie J. Ventura] of the health statistics center said it was unusual that 2006 birth rates rose for both teenagers and older women. In the past, a strong economy ''contributed to a decline in the teenage birth rate, because they saw they could get good jobs, so they put off childbirth,'' she said. ''For older people, a good economy makes them say, 'We can afford to have another child.'

How Democracy Produced a Monster,"Ian Kershaw, a professor of modern history at Sheffield University, is the author of the forthcoming ''Hitler, the Germans and the Final Solution.'' In Zimbabwe, President Robert Mugabe has turned democracy into personal rule, ruining his country in the process. In Pakistan, democracy largely provides a facade for military rule, even if President Pervez Musharraf has now put aside his uniform. Most worryingly, perhaps, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has used populist support in a pluralist system to push Iran into a hazardous foreign policy, though he does remain formally subordinate to the ''supreme leader,'' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mercifully, what happened in Germany in 1933, and its aftermath, will remain a uniquely terrible episode in history. What took place then reminds us even so of the illusory assumption that democracy will always be a favored choice of a population torn apart by war, facing enormous privations and burning with resentment at national humiliation through perceived foreign interference. It also reminds us -- if such a reminder is necessary -- of the need for international cooperation to restrain potential ''mad dogs'' in world politics before they are dangerous enough to bite.",433799121,Newspapers," Kershaw, IanIanIan KershawKershawIan Kershaw", NYTIAO,," Copyright New York Times Company Feb 3, 2008"," 1422866271 , 38267321 , 7818 , NYTIAO , NYT , 497622-20080203", Commentary," Feb 3, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, WK.17," New York, N.Y.",3-Feb-08,New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433799121?accountid=14496,,,, WK.17,," Democracy , Dictators , Nazi era , Germany , Zimbabwe , Russia , Hitler, Adolf (1889-1945) , Chavez, Hugo , Putin, Vladimir",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=How+Democracy+Produced+a+Monster%3A+%5BOp-Ed%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-02-03&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=WK.17&amp;au=Kershaw%2C+Ian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,New York Times

"With Issues of War and Peace on Their Minds, Voters Make Choices","Mitt Romney won in his home state, with both the party faithful and independents flocking to his side, according to exit polling. Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, matched Senator John McCain in attracting voters who identified themselves as moderate and took the vast majority of those who identified themselves as conservative. Mr. McCain surprised many by making a campaign stop in Boston on Sunday, where he watched the Super Bowl in a hotel lobby. Polls showed the contest tightening, and Mr. McCain told audiences that he believed he had a chance of winning the state's 43 delegates. Mr. Mc- Cain won the primary in 2000, defeating George W. Bush by nearly two to one. But Mr. Romney dismissed the 11th hour visit by Mr. Mc- Cain, saying, ''I've got a lot of friends there.'' Many observers had said that if Mr. Romney lost his home state, it would signal the end of the campaign. Although state officials had said they expected a record turnout, rain throughout the day seemed to temper that. Mr. McCain's effort to court conservative Republicans helped him win in Illinois, where nearly 4 in 10 primary voters who described themselves as conservatives said they had voted for him, according to early exit polls. Mr. Romney, who had argued that a vote for Mr. McCain represented an abandonment of the party's conservative principles, won slightly fewer votes among conservatives, the exit polls showed. Earlier polls had shown Mr. McCain with a strong lead in Illinois, a state with an open primary and 70 delegates at stake. As was the case elsewhere, Republican primary voters polled here were far less concerned about immigration than about the economy. Although Mr. Romney argued that his business career better prepared him to manage the nation's fiscal matters, voters who cited the economy as their major concern chose Mr. Mc- Cain. Overwhelmingly, voters surveyed in Illinois said that Mr. McCain was more qualified than any of his competitors to be commander in chief.",433792460,Newspapers," RUSS BUETTNER, KAREEM FAHIM, JENNIFER MEDINA, WILLIAM NEUMAN CONTRIBUTED and MICHAEL R.

"Upstate, Drop In Catholics Leads to Drop In Churches","''The loss in population is a political problem whose repercussions have been felt not just on the tax base and the infrastructure of those communities, but also in other areas, including religious institutions,'' said Chester Gillis, chairman of the theology department at Georgetown University. ''The bottom line is simple,'' Professor Gillis said. ''If you have less people donating to the church, it becomes unrealistic -- and it is financially irresponsible, really -- to keep a church building open.'' ''What we were finding was that most, if not all, of the parish collections were going to maintenance, and that a lot of these parishes simply weren't growing,'' Mr. [Kevin A. Keenan] said. The new Catholic immigrants who have moved into Buffalo and surrounding communities, mostly African and Eastern European refugees, ''are not enough to offset the losses,'' he added. ''We're trying to maintain our congregation working as close to normal as we can,'' Ms. Eaton said. ''We're like family.

Recovering the Complex Legacy of the Photographer Jacob Riis,"By [Jacob Riis]'s time, social and political reform efforts had been going on for half a century, but to little effect. What made the difference was his photographs, which Riis used in popular lectures and in his best-selling book, ''How the Other Half Lives,'' published in 1890, five years before the Mulberry Bend tenements were finally torn down. The starkness of Riis's photographs never fades. The memory of how Riis actually used his photographs, especially in his lectures, has faded. We expect the harshness of the camera's eye, its unblinking testimony.

From Dancehall Rapper to Nursery Rhymer,"Mr. Rhoden's act wasn't always so kid-friendly. Just as Mr. [Dan Zanes] was once the lead singer for a 1980s rock band called the Del Fuegos, Mr. Rhoden' had a musical career with an even more unexpected first act. During the 1980s and '90s Father Goose was known as Rankin Don, a hardcore dancehall rapper (or ''D.J.'' in reggae parlance) from Brooklyn. His best-known release was the 12-inch single ''Baddest D.J.,'' a brazen declaration of lyrical superiority punctuated with gun-slinging hyperbole: ''The 16 'pon me back, the Desert Eagle 'pon me hip.'' Perhaps the most striking aspect of Mr. Rhoden's album is the way it reconnects dancehall with its roots in songs like ''Chi Chi Budoo'' and ''Long Time Gal,'' which were first popularized by the folklorist and poet Louise Bennett, a Jamaican national hero better known as Miss Lou. Even as late as 1980 Jamaican dancehall pioneers Michigan &amp; Smiley adapted one of their biggest hits, ''Rub a Dub Style,'' from the nursery rhyme ''Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary.'' Such innocent themes eventually fell out of favor in the dancehall, but as Mr. Rhoden said, ''Sometimes you have to go back to go forward.'' Mr. Rhoden said of his second career: ''To be honest, I didn't expect any of this. Just to see so many people embracing it with so much love is unbelievable.'' Now Father Goose has begun rehearsing his own reggae band and making plans for a tour. And as for his show with Dan Zanes &amp; Friends at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, suffice it to say that Father Goose has invited a few friends. ''It's going be one big party,'' he said. ''Everybody knows I'm the one that normally get the party started. My party started in Jamaica, and everywhere I go there's a party. And the party doesn't stop.''",433786025,Newspapers," Kenner, RobRobRob KennerKennerRob Kenner", NYTIAO,," Copyright New York Times Company Feb 17, 2008"," 1430290511 , 38379581 , 7818 , NYTIAO , NYT , 262811-20080217", Feature," Feb 17, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, AR.1," New York, N.Y.",17-Feb-08,New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433786025?accountid=14496,,,, AR.1,," Rap music , Musicians & conductors , Childrens music , Rhoden, Wayne (Father Goose)",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=From+Dancehall+Rapper+to+Nursery+Rhymer&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-02-17&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=AR.1&amp;au=Kenner%2C+Rob&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,New York Times
"At Suffolk Building Sites, Sweeps For Illegal Workers Net Just One","''It's really meant to keep the contractor honest as a deterrent approach, as the I.R.S. does with its audit process,'' Mr. [Mark Smith] said. ''Not everyone is going to get audited, and the vast majority is going to comply.'' He added, ''We never had a predetermined number, that we were going to catch X number of people.'' Mr. Smith, the county spokesman, said the local law should change nothing for law-abiding contractors, since there has long been a federal law to similar effect: Section 1324a of Title 8 of the United States Code declares it unlawful to hire undocumented immigrants. Mr. [Steve Levy]'s ''Affidavit of Compliance'' simply has contractors swear to follow those laws ''with respect to the alien and nationality status'' of workers. ''These laws are all a public relations ploy playing to an anti-immigrant mentality,'' he said. ''Steve Levy has used the community as political punching bag.

"In Little Little Havana, Not Quite as Much of a Cuban Feel","Union City is still a vital, bustling center of Latin culture. Even the sign for Joe's Pizza promises ''Pollos a la Brasa.'' But once dominated by Cubans, it is now a hodgepodge of the Latin, and sometimes Asian, diasporas. It's not quite New Jersey's answer to Little Italy, a place defined by what it once was. Still, ask Victor Bas, who owns El Waterloo clothing, the store his father opened in 1967, about things now and he shrugs: ''There's a lot of 'used to be' around here.'' He still sells guayaberas and linen shirts in bright colors -- ''happy clothes'' -- to Latin immigrants. But the days when the stores on Bergenline Avenue were, like his father's, named for well-known businesses in Cuba are long gone. ''Back then it was more Main Street, U.S.A., or maybe Main Street, Havana,'' he said. ''Now it's more diverse, more hectic. To be honest, I miss the old days.'' ''In the past, you could never imagine seeing a Che Guevara shirt on Bergenline Avenue,'' she said. ''Now, sometimes I see them, and I have to laugh. I said, 'Oh, my God, you haven't been lynched yet?' But I guess you can wear that now.''",433783954,Newspapers," Applebome, PeterPeterPeter ApplebomeApplebomePeter Applebome , E-mail: peappl@nytimes.comE-mail: peappl@nytimes.com", NYTIAO,," Copyright New York Times Company Feb 21, 2008"," 1432297611 , 38407331 , 7818 , NYTIAO , NYT , 215023-20080221", Commentary," Feb 21, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, B.1," New York, N.Y.",21-Feb-08,New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433783954?accountid=14496,,,, B.1,," Retirement , Hispanic Americans , Neighborhoods , Union City New Jersey , Cuba , Castro, Fidel",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=In+Little+Little+Havana%2C+Not+Quite+as+Much+of+a+Cuban+Feel&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-02-21&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=B.1&amp;au=Applebome%2C+Peter%3BE-mail%3A+peappl%40nytimes.com&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,New York Times

A Fluid Religious Life Is Seen Among Americans,"It shows, for example, that every religion is losing and gaining members, but that the Roman Catholic Church ''has experienced the greatest net losses as a result of affiliation changes.'' The survey also indicates that the group that had the greatest net gain was the unaffiliated. Sixteen percent of American adults say they are not part of any organized faith, which makes the unaffiliated the country's fourth-largest ''religious group.'' Michael Lindsay, assistant director of the Center on Race, Religion and Urban Life at Rice University, echoed that view. ''Religion is the single most important factor that drives American belief attitudes and behaviors,'' said Mr. Lindsay, who had read the Pew report. ''It is a powerful indicator of where America will end up on politics, culture, family life. If you want to understand America, you have to understand religion in America.'' ''I think politicians will be looking at this survey to see what groups they ought to target,'' Professor [Stephen Prothero] said. ''If the Hindu population is negligible, they won't have to worry about it. But if it is wealthy, then they may have to pay attention.''",433778253,Newspapers," Banerjee, NeelaNeelaNeela BanerjeeBanerjeeNeela Banerjee", NYTIAO,," Copyright New York Times Company Feb 26, 2008"," 1434834291 , 38447781 , 7818 , NYTIAO , NYT , 625191-20080226", News," Feb 26, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, A.12," New York, N.Y.",26-Feb-08,New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433778253?accountid=14496,,,, A.12,," Religion , Polls & surveys , Religious conversion , United States , US",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=A+Fluid+Religious+Life+Is+Seen+Among+Americans&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-02-26&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.12&amp;au=Banerjee%2C+Neela&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,New York Times

"Sleepy-Eyed Writer, Wandering Byzantium","He has published steadily every since, eventually turning from more or less autobiographical work to books like ''Clockers'' and ''Freedomland,'' big, Dickensian novels about the drug trade and life in the projects. He has also written the screenplays for ''Clockers,'' ''The Color of Money'' (for which he received the Oscar nomination), ''Sea of Love'' and ''Mad Dog and Glory,'' among other movies, and recently he has written some episodes for the HBO series ''The Wire,'' which won him the Edgar. He's one of a handful of contemporary novelists to work for Hollywood and emerge more or less unscathed. Like ''Clockers'' and ''Freedomland,'' ''Lush Life'' is at its core a thriller or a mystery story -- about a holdup ending in a murder. ''I tend to like crime for a backbone,'' Mr. [Richard Price] said recently. ''An investigation will take you through a landscape.'' The landscape in this case -- the subject of the book, really -- is the Lower East Side, which Mr. Price depicts as a neighborhood of colliding populations: the few remaining Jewish old-timers; the people from the projects; the La Bohemers, as he calls them, the trust-fund couples with their M.F.A.'s and videocams; the Chinese immigrants, many of them illegal, who sleep, stacked on shelves, in some of the old tenements. ''I always like to hang out,'' he said, ''because, one, it's a way of avoiding really writing; and, two, sometimes God is a crackerjack novelist and you can plagiarize the hell out of him.'' He particularly liked hanging out with cops, he said, ''because I'm so not a cop myself. Being with them gets me out of my own self-consciousness.'' ''Lush Life'' begins with an undercover team Mr. Price calls the Quality of Life Task Force, who troll the late-night traffic coming off the Williamsburg Bridge, looking for cars that drive slowly and properly signal for a lane change.

Banks Springing Up to Serve the Underserved,"For bankers, focusing on a niche is a way to set themselves apart from the competition. ''If a person sees three banks on the same block, each one offering the same products at the same price, what differentiates you?'' asks Steven F. Young, senior vice president for consumer banking at Wainwright Bank and Trust in Boston. Wainwright's reputation as a socially responsible bank that invests most of its deposits in community development and progressive nonprofit organizations ''has led us to be very profitable,'' Mr. Young said. ''People like what we're doing with their money.'' In fact, Mr. [David Flores] said, ''25 or 30 Hispanic banks are either starting up now or have started up in the last two or three years.'' Among them is Plaza Bank in Seattle, which offers low-fee fund transfers and Spanish-language checks, statements, loan applications and online banking. ''All of our personnel are bilingual and bicultural,'' says Carlos Guangorena, Plaza Bank's chief executive. ''That helps people who haven't been banked come into the fabric of the economic community.'' Similarly, many of the nation's almost five million Muslims have special banking concerns that often go unaddressed by mainstream banks. In particular, Sharia, Islamic law, forbids the charging or paying of interest. ''This hampers most bank transactions,'' said Amjad Quadri, assistant vice president for business development and new markets at the University Islamic Financial Corporation, a bank based in Ann Arbor, Mich. As a result, many Muslims decide to rent rather than buy homes. ''And most Muslims only have interest-free checking accounts and credit cards that they pay off at the end of the month,'' Mr. Quadri said.",433815888,Newspapers," Galst, LizLizLiz GalstGalstLiz Galst", NYTIAO,," Copyright New York Times Company Mar 8, 2008"," 1442216591 , 38574121 , 7818 , NYTIAO , NYT , 957780-20080308", Feature," Mar 8, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, C.6," New York, N.Y.",8-Mar-08,New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433815888?accountid=14496,,,, C.6,," Community banks , Minority banks , Muslims , Hispanics , Environmental protection",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=Banks+Springing+Up+to+Serve+the+Underserved&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-03-08&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=C.6&amp;au=Galst%2C+Liz&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,New York Times

''Although his innovations quickly became commonplace,'' the authors write, ''Riis posed a series of urgent, often implicit, questions to himself and his readers, which remain surprisingly apt today: What is the structural relationship between persistent poverty and new immigrants? If different 'races' and nationalities possess inherent moral and cultural characteristics, how can that be reconciled with the American creed of individualism? How does environment shape 'character'? What are the proper roles of government, public philanthropy, and religion in reform efforts? How important is spectacle and entertainment in rousing the public conscience?''

"An Aversion to the Death Penalty, but No Shortage of Cases","''Not many New York cases have 'innocent victims,' '' Mr. [Kevin McNally] said. He added that white female victims, for example, were ''death in a bottle for defense lawyers.'' Other Brooklyn judges in recent years have spoken out against the death penalty from the bench and in print. Last March, Judge Frederic Block wrote an Op-Ed piece for The New York Times in which he questioned the ''enormous costs and burdens to the judicial system'' caused by the death penalty. In 2003, his colleague Judge John Gleeson wrote an article for The Virginia Law Review in which he called Mr. [John Ashcroft]'s decision to force prosecutors to seek the death penalty against their own recommendations ''a bad idea.''

Journalism in the Hands of the Neighborhood,"''We are uncomfortable with the term 'citizen journalism,' '' said Todd Wolfson, 35, a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the organizers of the Media Mobilizing Project in Philadelphia.

Normal recovery didn't begin until the most onerous of these policies were reversed, a process that didn't begin until the end of the 1930s when antitrust activity was resumed, and during World War II when the National War Labor Board reduced union bargaining power by limiting negotiated wage increases to cost-of-living adjustments only.",399091444,Newspapers," Ohanian, Lee ELeeLee E OhanianOhanianELee E.
