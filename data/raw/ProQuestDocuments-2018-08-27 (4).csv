Many in the Muslim World See a Provocation: Islam Itself as a Problem,"On Friday, Mr. Trump said that once the United States resumed the intake of refugees, Christians would receive priority. [...]recently, ""If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible,"" he told Christian Broadcasting News. [...]the United States accepts tens of thousands of Christian refugees. According to the Pew Research Center, almost as many Christian refugees (37,521) were admitted as Muslim refugees (38,901) in the 2016 fiscal year. In a recent article for Politico, Mr. Sharro drew on the growing similarities between the United States' political scene and that of many Arab countries, with allegations of vote rigging, feuds involving the security services, accusations of foreign meddling and vicious arguments between the country's leader and the media. Pakistan has nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia is a major source of oil, and the United Arab Emirates is a major source of investment. During the Obama administration, a program to grant special visas to interpreters was continued, even as the process was delayed by resistance in Congress and ever stricter security screening procedures.",1862281750,Newspapers," Walsh, Declan

Travelers Express Shock and Bewilderment Over U.S. Visa Crackdown,"Families, businesspeople, athletes and tourists from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa found their travel plans -- and even their futures -- in a state of suspension on Friday after President Trump signed an executive order temporarily barring thousands from obtaining visas to travel to the United States. During the 90-day period, the Trump administration will assess if the foreign governments on the list are providing enough information about citizens seeking visas to enable the United States to assess whether they pose a terrorism risk. The visa ban will provide an early indication of where relations between Tehran and the Trump administration are headed, one analyst said. Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, a Washington-based advocacy group, said many Iranian citizens with valid green cards and American visas were distraught. Iran's most popular actress, Taraneh Alidoosti, announced on Twitter that she was canceling her trip to the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles on Feb. 26, after reports that Mr. Trump was about to sign the sweeping executive order. In 2015, according to the Department of Homeland Security, a total of 35,266 nonimmigrant visas were granted to Iranians to enter the United States, compared with...",1862285948,Newspapers," Erdbrink, Thomas

Pence: 'Life is winning again in America',"Vice president addresses annual antiabortion march in Washington Thousands of abortion opponents gathered in cold, blustery weather near the Washington Monument on Friday and heard Vice President Pence tell the annual March for Life that the Trump administration is determined to advance the fight against abortion. The massive crowd, bearing flags, banners and placards, then flowed down Constitution Avenue, filling the street, and rallied at the Supreme Court building, across from the Capitol. [...]he said that ""next week, President Donald Trump will announce a Supreme Court nominee who will uphold the God-given liberty enshrined in our Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia."" Scalia, a conservative associate justice of the Supreme Court, died last year. Pence, who has called himself an ""evangelical Catholic,"" has long been a hero among antiabortion activists and as governor of Indiana signed what were considered some of the nation's strictest laws on abortion. Earlier, Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, listed her four demands for Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress: lAppoint an antiabortion justice to the Supreme Court. lMake the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for many abortions in the United States, into a permanent law rather than the one-year provision that has been extended each year since 1976. lPass a law banning abortion nationwide after 20 weeks of pregnancy. lStop all federal funding for Planned Parenthood unless the organization stops performing abortions.

Why Trump's promises look like pie in the sky,"On a host of issues, including health care, trade and immigration, Trump began his presidency with executive orders intended to both placate and excite his base by keeping his bold campaign promises - in rhetoric, if not immediate, tangible results. Under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, the president or any other leaders must give six months' notice of his or her intention to withdraw. [...]specifying U.S.-made steel is a violation of the World Trade Organization agreement, except in cases of national security - which this is not. ""President Trump needs to go back to civics class, because he can direct his employees to do various things, but he cannot repeal a bunch of laws through his executive orders because he needs congressional consent - and the executive orders themselves say that,"" said Rena Steinzor, a professor at the University of Maryland's law school. [...]although there is broad consensus among Republicans about the need to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act - a process Trump began with an executive order the day he was sworn in - there is far less harmony on exactly when and how to handle the issue. David Axelrod, a former senior Obama adviser, pointed to Obama's executive order his first week in office to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, noting that he faced stiff congressional opposition and never completed his pledge.

"Trump suspends refugee entry, vows priority for Christians","[...]we are going to help them."" Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war and the rise of the Islamic State, many more Muslims than Christians have been killed or displaced because of the violence. The order calls for a halt to the flow of refugees from Syria until further notice and suspends all refugee admissions for 120 days until more analysis can determine which countries harbor the greatest threat. The downsizing of the refugee program, which had grown under the Obama administration, fulfills Trump's campaign pledge to start the ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants and refugees, even though the United States already conducts the most rigorous and drawn-out screening process in the world. Refugee advocates slammed the order as cruel, while proponents of tighter immigration controls said it would protect Americans from radical Islamists who might try to sneak into the United States as refugees and launch an attack. ""The ban on refugees will severely cripple the U.S. refugee program, leaving thousands who face life-threatening danger without humanitarian protection,"" said Greg Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

2016 ended with a sluggish U.S. economy,"""The GDP data show that the economy's growth peaked about the middle of 2014, just when commodity prices peaked, and the big downturn in commodity prices led to a slowdown in activity that affected the next year and a half,"" said Kevin Logan, chief U.S. economist at HSBC. Businesses have been reluctant to spend, given the lack of clarity about what the Trump administration might do in terms of economic policy, trade, government spending, immigration, corporate reforms and regulation, Bostjancic said. To reach that ambitious target, the United States will have to overcome significant challenges, such as a working-age population that is shrinking as baby boomers retire, and sluggish productivity growth, economists said. At a news conference in December, Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen implied that the central bank would be looking closely to changes in taxes and government spending as it charts its course for the coming years.",1862287120,Newspapers," Swanson, Ana

Forgotten memorial is set for revival,"On the speedway that Hill Street becomes between downtown and Chinatown, a motorist could never appreciate the structure's eloquently worded tribute to military service, the pioneer spirit and California history. On July 3, 1958, members of the Mormon Battalion of Salt Lake City, some of them descendants of the original military unit that played a key role in early California, reenacted the first raising of the American flag over Los Angeles 111 years earlier. The Mormon Battalion was soon discharged, its place in history secured less for military feats than for blazing a southwest route for the settlement of the new U.S. territory where many of the soldiers' descendants then settled. Donna Williams, who was the consulting conservator for the Hall of Justice and Hollyhock House restorations, will oversee the preservation work, ensuring that it follows U.S. Department of Interior guidelines so the memorial can one day be added to the list of historic sites, Haggarty said. [...]officials are mindful of the need to balance the goals of historical accuracy and water conservation, said David Palma, capital projects manager with the county Department of Public Works. A renovation project is set to replace tiles, scrub graffiti shadows, restore the bas-relief mural and, finally, turn on the water.; PHOTOGRAPHER:",1862497399,Newspapers," Smith, Doug

"LITTLE SAIGON; A CLEAN SLATE FOR NEW YEAR; Vietnamese rush to pay off debts before the start of Tet, a holiday tradition that can often bring stress","At his kiosk at the Asian Garden Mall, Do Le stood alert, hawking all manner of holiday goods at a bargain price -- paper dragons, bronze roosters and a wide variety of ""lucky"" red envelopes used for giving cash. Long before his work shift, Le tended to an ancestral altar at his home, as tradition requires, then drove to South Coast Plaza and Westminster Mall to shop for new clothes for his family to celebrate the Year of the Rooster. Phu Nguyen, vice president at Hoa Phat, a money transfer service with four branches across Orange County and 30 branches nationwide, said a quarter of the company's business comes in the month leading up to Tet. Obligations and expectations around Tet can exceed those at Christmastime in the U.S., said Vu-Duc Vuong, a retired sociology teacher from the Bay Area who edits a publication on education in Vietnam.

Many big names still on fence in the governor race,"Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer was considering a run but now says he may have a higher calling -- contesting President Trump's attempts to roll back policies that combat climate change and protect immigrants.The news site Politico has spent the last month stoking whispers that PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, one of the few tech giants to back Trump's presidential campaign, may be entertaining a run.[...]in May he categorically rejected the idea of a gubernatorial bid when pressed about it during his reelection campaign for mayor.Jason Roe, one of the mayor's political consultants, said Faulconer has been encouraged by many prominent Republicans to run, and although he listened to their arguments, he has not committed.Riordan, who himself ran for governor in 2002 and lost in the Republican primary to conservative Bill Simon, was mulling over a second run during the 2003 recall campaign against then-Democratic Gov. Gray Davis.Riordan said he was all set to jump in after potential GOP rival Arnold Schwarzenegger came to his house one Sunday and urged him to run, offering his full support.Just a week after U.S. Sen.

THE WORLD; Refugee families face a new limbo; Trump's executive order forces many to scramble to rearrange their lives.,"For Syrians attempting to flee the nearly six-year-old civil war in their country, Trump's policy, based on a draft of the order, would indefinitely suspend their chances of finding refuge in the U.S., a country that many blame for failing to stop the conflict. For citizens of countries including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- whose visa applications would be blocked until a new ""extreme vetting"" procedure is put in place -- the policy would separate families, keep parents from attending their children's weddings and perhaps make it tougher for green-card holders to come home to the U.S. ""Why is Trump victimizing Iranians as people?"" asked a 45-year-old engineer in Tehran, who asked that his name be withheld because he did not want to run afoul of U.S. authorities. Even before Trump signed the executive order Friday afternoon, families in the affected countries reacted to reports about a draft of the policy obtained by the Los Angeles Times and other news organizations. The father of three left Homs in late 2012 and settled in Jordan, before migration officials contacted him and asked if he wanted to go to the U.S. This week he called the International Organization for Migration, which processes asylum cases, but officers there said they had heard nothing. The language in the executive order was so broad, Abdi said, that it was not immediately clear whether green-card holders -- who have undergone strict vetting to become permanent U.S. residents -- would be allowed to come...",1862498706,Newspapers," Bengali, Shashank

Schumer added his voice Friday to those who said they will not support Trump's selection for secretary of State, former ExxonMobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson.Having declared a new policy of ""America first"" in his inauguration, Trump's focus with May was on the potential benefits of increased bilateral trade.[...]for a president who has presented himself as a muscular leader, Trump's public statement that a Cabinet secretary's views on a key issue would ""override"" his own was highly unusual.PRESIDENT TRUMP speaks at a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May.",1862501582,Newspapers," Wilkinson, Tracy

TRUMP SHUTS NATION'S DOOR TO MOST REFUGEES; 'Extreme vetting' order is the broadest such policy change since the 1970s,"The action capped Trump's frenetic first week in the White House, as well as a busy day that included his first meeting with a foreign leader, British Prime Minister Theresa May.Trump's action, seen as part of his campaign pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country, sparked an international outcry, given the historical role that the U.S. and other industrialized nations have long played in embracing victims of war and oppression. ""Broad-brush discrimination against refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, most of whom are women and children, runs counter to our national security interests, and will likely be used as a terrorist recruitment tool.""[...]Trump won backing from some key congressional Republicans, including Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who leads the House Homeland Security Committee. ""Donald Trump is retracting the promise of American freedom to an extent we have not seen from a president since Franklin Roosevelt forced Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II,"" said Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect in New York City. -- brian.bennett@latimes.com noah.bierman@latimes.com Times staff writer Michael A.

Anxiety About Muslim Refugees Is Stoked Online by the Far-Right Media,"Type the word refugees into Facebook and some alarming ""news"" will appear about a refugee rape crisis, a refugee flesh-eating disease epidemic and a refugee-related risk of female genital mutilation -- none of it true. Syrian Refugees Spreading Flesh-Eating Disease, Polio, Measles, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis In speaking to pollsters about refugee resettlement, Americans tend to cite concerns about the country's national security and economic health as their biggest worries, but they have also begun to point to disease or rape, experts say. Muslim Refugees Causing Rape Epidemic in the U.S. Mr. Galston said the reaction to misleading coverage of refugees was reminiscent of the wave of measures introduced in state legislatures in recent years to stop the spread of Islamic law, despite scant evidence that it has been promoted anywhere. Muslim Immigration Puts Half a Million U.S. Girls at Risk of Genital Mutilation Outside his job as a police officer in Kansas, Okla., Mike Eason begins and ends his day with the television news -- first CBS, then Fox, but never CNN, which he hates.

Judge Blocks Trump Order On Refugees,"Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, ruled just before 9 p.m. that implementing Mr. Trump's order by sending the travelers home could cause them ""irreparable harm."" Minutes after the judge's ruling in New York City, another judge, Leonie M. Brinkema of Federal District Court in Virginia, issued a temporary restraining order for a week to block the removal of any green card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport. Human rights groups reported that legal permanent residents of the United States who hold green cards were being stopped in foreign airports as they sought to return from funerals, vacations or study abroad. Legal residents who have a green card and are currently in the United States should meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters. A Christian family of six from Syria said in an email to Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, that they were being detained on Saturday morning at Philadelphia International Airport despite having legal paperwork, green cards and visas that had been approved. Mr. Darweesh's wife and children made it through passport control and customs, but agents of Customs and Border Protection detained him. &gt; In Istanbul, during a stopover on Saturday, passengers reported that security officers had entered a plane after everyone had boarded and ordered a young Iranian woman and her family to leave the aircraft.",1862472306,Newspapers," Shear, Michael D

A Sisterly 'No' to Donald Trump,"&gt; On his first full day in office, our new president harangued the National Park Service about more flattering inauguration photos and preened in front of a memorial to real American heroes, crowing about how often he's been on the cover of Time magazine. Before his first full week was done, he temporarily barred refugees from entering the United States, halted immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries and decreed that Christians get preference over Muslims when we let outsiders in. No hoisting of signs. [...]recently they thought it was enough to keep up with the news and cast their votes in accordance with their support of the Democratic Party. [...]we're seeing something else -- something sunnier -- beyond the White House: an awakening in many Americans who were trusting, complacent or distracted before. Mythili told me that as she watches Trump and the people around him reject science, construct alternate realities and try to silence anyone who balks at that, she worries that the very idea of America is in jeopardy. Meera is the head of marketing for a start-up near her home in the Boston suburbs. ""Who talks that way?"" Mythili said, adding that he promoted ""the total objectification...",1862473199,Newspapers," Bruni, Frank

"Soccer Fans From California Cheer the Home Team, in Tijuana","Tents had sprung up between the S.U.V.s and minivans that nearly filled the parking lot, and open grills sent banks of smoke into the cold, wet air. (The Xoloitzcuintli, or Xolo (pronounced SHOW-low, is an indigenous breed of dog, and its image is prominent in the club's branding.) In the two years since Martinez's son got her interested in Xolos games, the other Californians in the X.F.F.X. crew have become some of her closest friends, gathering a few times each year for baby showers and to watch away games on television, texting daily, and seeing one another whenever they can at matches in Tijuana. Hank's many exploits over the years -- including a run-in with the United States immigration authorities involving a suitcase full of elephant tusks and ocelot-skin jackets -- earned him a notoriety to match his financial and political power in the city. Three years later, in 2007, he founded the Xolos and, soon after, opened the stadium that now bears the name of the family company, Grupo Caliente, as do the casino and dog-racing track on the next lot and numerous other large developments around the city. (The zoo moved to an adjacent plot, where Hank's camels and three white Bengal tigers are still visible from the parking lot.) Ricardo and Rodrigo Rodriguez, twins born in Tijuana who have spent the past 17 years living in San Diego, started attending games in 2009 along with their older brother, Oscar.

""Foreigners from those seven nations have killed zero Americans in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil between 1975 and the end of 2015,"" Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote on the group's website.Michael Banerian, 22, who was a Trump elector in the Electoral College, and is the youth vice chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, said he saw the president's more narrowly tailored order as common sense.A Google representative said, ""We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S."" Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in India, sent a memo to the company's workers saying that as many as 187 of its employees were affected.Jen Smyers, director of policy and advocacy for the immigration and refugee program of Church World Service, said that the executive order was ""akin to President Trump taking a wrecking ball to the Statue of Liberty.""",1862475484,Newspapers," Perez-Pena, Richard

Sports Fear Impact of Trump's Immigration Order,"President Trump's ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim nations could have a wide impact on international sports, including jeopardizing a warm relationship between the United States and Iran in wrestling competitions and threatening the chances of Los Angeles hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics and of the United States securing soccer's 2026 World Cup. On Saturday, sports officials struggled to understand the implications of Mr. Trump's executive order, including the question of whether athletes from the targeted nations could enter the United States to compete, especially in the initial 90-day period of the ban. On Saturday evening, a federal judge blocked part of the executive order, but that decision appeared unrelated to the elements of the ban that troubled sports officials. The United States is expected to bid to host the world's other major sporting event, the World Cup, in 2026. Mo Farah of Britain, who was born in Somalia and has won four Olympic gold medals on the track at 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, is a Nike-sponsored athlete coached by Alberto Salazar. Jackie Brock-Doyle, a spokeswoman for track and field's world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, said, ""We clearly need to understand the implications of this new U.S. immigration policy and will be seeking assurances that it will not adversely affect"" the sport's world championships, scheduled to be held in Eugene, Ore., in 2021.",1862475974,Newspapers," Longman, Jere

Talk About the Weather,"Doug Palen, a fourth-generation grain farmer on Kansas' wind-swept plains, is in the business of understanding the climate. Since 2012, he has choked through the harshest drought to hit the Great Plains in a century, punctuated by freakish snowstorms and suffocating gales of dust. [...]he is a climate change realist. Regional politicians and business leaders speak of pursuing jobs that clean energy may create, rather than pressing the need to rein in carbon emissions. A science teacher at a community college -- whose deeply religious students sometimes express doubts about the trustworthiness of science that contradicts biblical teachings -- speaks to his class about the positives of scientific discovery (electricity) in order to ease into more contentious subjects (global warming). Much of that consensus has broken down, in no small part because of a well-financed push by fossil-fuel interests, together with influential Republican allies, to attack well-established research on topics like global warming and push back on environmental regulation. President Trump has famously said he believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and his administration has purged nearly all mention of climate-change programs from the White House and State Department websites. The group has been petitioning the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.

"Fear, anger at O'Hare after Trump order","Thirteen people were believed to be in custody Saturday night at O'Hare International Airport as authorities enforced President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration from certain majority-Muslim countries -- a crackdown that left relatives frantic and prompted protesters to rush to the airport. Late in the day, a federal judge in New York temporarily barred the U.S. from deportations under the order, and lawyers at O'Hare assisting those in custody said they expected them to be freed soon. The couple -- jet-lagged from their 20-hour trip home from Iran -- looked tired and confused as they exited customs around 5:30 p.m. Noorian carried the names of about a dozen people he said were still being held and phone numbers for their relatives. The Department of Homeland Security said the order also bars green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States. White House officials said Saturday that green card holders from the seven affected countries would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the U.S. Hundreds of people protested inside and outside O'Hare's international terminal Saturday night, chanting, ""The whole world is watching.""

IMMIGRATION RULES,"While that sentiment is shared among some advisers to President Donald Trump, the experiences of these towns show how measures targeting such immigrants can leave lasting and bitter racial divisions while doing little to address the underlying forces that determine where newcomers settle. The executive order issued Friday by Trump imposes a 120-day suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns. Kobach, a longtime activist who worked at the time for the legal arm of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, sought to use those towns as a testing ground for his aggressive stance. The municipality that has come the closest to successfully implementing such a law is Fremont, a meatpacking town west of Omaha where a six-year court fight, financed through a tax increase, won the city the right to ban immigrants living there illegally from rental housing. Michael Hethmon, who is senior counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute and helped Kobach handle the Hazleton case, said the local efforts have faced more setbacks than victories, but the towns' money has been ""well spent"" in taking a stance. The law easily won the city council's approval, but its enforcement was held up by an injunction and a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups, including the ACLU. A federal judge eventually ruled the law was illegal because it usurped the federal government's power and would affect not just immigrants in the country illegally but ""those...",1862556674,Newspapers," Chico Harlan

IMMIGRATION AT A CROSSROADS,"Chicago immigration reform advocates and Muslim leaders denounced President Donald Trump's executive order to temporarily block refugees coming to the U.S. while the government reviews screening processes, calling it an effective ban on Muslims in America. In issuing the order Friday, which calls for a four-month halt on all refugee admissions, an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and a temporary moratorium on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries with terrorism concerns, Trump said he seeks to protect the nation from terrorist attacks. The flow of foreign fighters from Iraq and Syria into other countries increases the chances of them winding up in the U.S. and becoming homegrown terrorists, said James Carafano, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies for the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think tank. At a news conference Friday, Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Chicago, said refugees and others seeking haven in the United States ""don't choose to leave"" but are forced out by persecution or violence. ""Because we do it differently or more stringently, that doesn't change that sentiment."" Benito, the advocate for refugees, acknowledged that visa procedures could benefit from a closer look, but he said halting refugee admissions while...",1862556955,Newspapers," Pashman, Manya Brachear

"Fear, anger at O'Hare after Trump order","U.S. authorities took more than a dozen travelers into custody Saturday at O'Hare International Airport in response to President Donald Trump's immigration order -- but lawyers who came to their aid said all were set free after a federal judge temporarily barred deportations.Even before a federal judge in New York ruled to block the U.S. from sending people out of the country under Trump's order, a few of those being held at O'Hare had already been released after hours of questioning.The Department of Homeland Security said the order also bars green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States.White House officials said Saturday that green card holders from the seven affected countries would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the U.S. Hundreds of people protested inside and outside O'Hare's international terminal Saturday night, chanting, ""The whole world is watching.""According to the sons, Noohi was on his plane, traveling from the United Arab Emirates, when Trump signed his order.Another person held, Abdulsalam Mused, 67, of Oak Lawn, was freed after more than six hours of questioning, and he stopped to shake hands with the volunteer attorneys and protesters.",1862556995,Newspapers,," Oakton Community College

"Fear, confusion in Silicon Valley; Immigration order surprises tech execs, compelling many to break their silence on Trump administration.","The morning after Donald Trump won the presidential election, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Amr Shady called his immigration lawyer in a panic. The move blindsided the technology industry, which thought that its main battle on the immigration front was over the number of H-1B visas -- granted to high-skilled foreign workers -- that would be made available each year. The tech sector relies heavily on foreign-born software engineers to meet its staffing needs, and it has long lobbied for the government to lift the cap on the H-1B visa program to allow more foreign workers temporary employment with U.S. firms. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said many drivers for the ride-hailing service are immigrants from the affected countries who often visit extended families abroad and might have trouble reentering the U.S. The company is considering compensating those drivers ""over the next three months to mitigate some of the financial stress and complications with supporting their families and putting food on the table.""

"Wins, losses in import tax plan","President Trump threw trade experts for another loop Thursday by endorsing -- or seeming to endorse -- a new tax system for imports and exports that he said would ""reduce our trade deficits [and] increase American exports.""The change, he added, ""would largely eradicate the 'stateless income' tax planning games through which U.S. multinationals carry on their books more than $2.5 trillion in very-low-taxed offshore earnings, at the expense of the United States and other countries where those firms are actually doing business.""[...]America's current tax structure encourages companies to invest in lower-tax countries, which shifts ""at least some of the corporate tax burden to domestic U.S. labor,"" economist Alan J. Auerbach of UC Berkeley wrote for the liberal Center for American Progress in 2010.A unilateral attack on the Mexican trade deficit would surely violate NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump says he want to renegotiate.Kleinbard observed that conflicts between the new policy and WTO law would ""defy any simple fix"" and present ""a recipe for years of dispute, business uncertainty and potential retaliatory tariffs.""Writing in the Financial Times on Jan. 8, Summers predicted that the change in tax structure ""will be seen by other countries and the World Trade Organization as a protectionist act that violates U.S. treaty obligations.[...]House tax-writers have acknowledged that their corporate tax changes will have to be revenue-neutral -- that is, the revenue gains would have to be used dollar-for-dollar to pay for corporate tax cuts.",1862560998,Newspapers," Hiltzik, Michael

ANALYSIS; A first week both normal and far from it,"All week, the White House rolled out executive orders and presidential memorandums, most of which were strikingly normal -- a word Trump's opponents hate to hear applied to him.In speeches, interviews and off-the-cuff remarks, Trump obsessed about the size of his inauguration crowds, nakedly declared that he favors ""torture"" -- dispensing with George W. Bush-style euphemisms about ""enhanced interrogation"" -- and sought to explain away his loss of the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by insisting on the falsehood that 3 million to 5 million illegal votes had been cast.The day after his inauguration, a rambling speech at the CIA in which he denounced the media for its reporting on the inaugural crowd count overshadowed Trump's initial executive orders.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly indicated that Trump has no immediate plans to act against the more than 740,000 so-called Dreamers who have the temporary right to live and work legally in the U.S. because of the program.Trump, when asked Friday about his comments on torture, said at a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, ""I happen to believe it does work,"" but added that he would defer to his Defense secretary, retired Gen. James N. Mattis, who disagrees.[...]Trump has ""a longer leash than some expect,"" he said.BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May visited President Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, becoming the first foreign leader to meet with the new president.",1862561204,Newspapers," Lauter, David

Police Chief Beck won't budge on immigration,"LAPD Chief Charlie Beck and I were chatting over breakfast, and I told him the story of a Border Patrol maintenance man who spent decades repairing holes in the border fence in Calexico. Beck is not alone among law enforcement and city officials who've taken this position -- city leaders from San Francisco to Chicago to New York have pledged to fight Trump's immigration policies even if it means the loss of federal funding. [...]Beck stands out among top cops, and has for years, having argued that if immigrants in the U.S. illegally were to fear deportation, they'd be less inclined to cooperate on criminal investigations. ""When you create a shadow population ... that fears any interaction"" with law enforcement, Beck said, ""then you create a whole population of victims, because they become prey for human predators who extort them or abuse them because they know they won't contact the police."" [...]he evolved as he better understood practical realities and the essence of Los Angeles, which implemented Special Order 40 in 1979 to prevent police from doing the federal work of immigration control.

"TRUMP ORDER BLOCKED; Ban on U.S. entries sparks confusion, protest and a legal rebuke","President Trump's executive order suspending refugee arrivals and banning entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries spawned chaos and consternation across the globe Saturday, stranding unwitting travelers, prompting passionate debate over American values and igniting a fierce legal pushback that yielded early court victories for the president's opponents. Capping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them ""irreparable harm."" The groups bringing the legal challenge, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry. The suit, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Virginia, argues that the executive order is unconstitutional because of its apparent aim of singling out Muslims. On Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. Some reports have put the number of such permanent residents from the affected countries as high as half a million. A German radio network quoted federal police as saying that 20 people from all seven countries on the list were stuck in the airport's transit zone, unable to board flights for the U.S. There was...",1862561412,Newspapers," King, Laura

Consumer culture and its consequences; America wants to employ immigrants and deport them too.,"The same might be said for carpentry, plumbing, painting, roofing, and building swimming pools. The pallet industry is essential to American commerce and the low price of goods. Wages kept at $11 to $13 an hour in these businesses go some way toward explaining how companies can provide free shipping for e-commerce orders, which is labor intensive. Continued or increased large-scale deportation will surely result in a loss of skill sets and willing workers, particularly for certain regions of the country. (The Obama administration's deportations are probably behind the unionizing energy we've seen in the last year in Southern California at El Super, a supermarket chain, and at Farmer John, a meat-products manufacturer.) Another logical result of increased deportation would be higher consumer prices, of course.",1862561492,Newspapers," Quinones, Sam

"For negotiating tips, Trump should read 'Art of the Deal'","Negotiating with North Korea, the Taliban, Sudan and Cuba is not comparable to bartering with casino moguls, real estate czars and hotel chains. The United States needs to stand firmly behind Israel; in my opinion, our recent abstention at the United Nations on a resolution condemning settlements was a mistake. In 1996, when I persuaded Sudanese rebel leader Kerubino Kwanyin Bol to release three Red Cross workers despite his initial multi-million dollar ransom demand, we held a joint news conference with several diplomats in attendance and praised Bol's humanitarian gesture. Tuesday, Pena Nieto's government floated the idea of pulling out of NAFTA and lessening Mexico's cooperation on cartels, security and immigration, all important U.S. interests. Committing to repealing the Affordable Care Act, before a new plan has been negotiated with the insurance industry and health-care providers, will make President Trump negotiate from a point of weakness, desperate to make a deal. [...]doing away with the Iran nuclear deal instead of using it as leverage to negotiate amendments and change the Iranian regime's unacceptable behavior - such as its support for known terrorist organizations and calls for the destruction of Israel - would be counter to negotiator Trump's logic.

Fears replace lost dreams of living in safety,"ISTANBUL - ISTANBUL - After working as an interpreter for an American security company in Iraq and enduring years of background checks after applying for a U.S. visa, Labeeb Ali's hopes of moving to the United States ended abruptly in Qatar's international airport on Saturday, when officials prevented him from boarding a flight to Texas. President Trump's order on Friday to temporarily ban citizens of several Muslim countries from entering the United States sowed panic, confusion and anguish in airports across the globe Saturday, as nationals of the affected countries were either barred by airlines from traveling or detained upon arrival in the United States. Qatar Airways said that passengers would be allowed to travel only if they were permanent green-card holders or had visas that were exempt from the order. There were unconfirmed reports that Iranian visitors as well as permanent green-card holders were restricted from traveling to the United States by officials at airports in Amsterdam, Abu Dhabi as well as Qatar, according to Hazhir Rahmandad, an Iranian American professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who created a crowdsourced database to track Iranian travelers affected by the ban.

Mexico can thrive without Trump,"Equally erroneous is President Trump's failure to account for how modern transportation systems and information technology have changed international trade. Many American firms are able to compete successfully around the world with those from Europe and Asia, and therefore can provide high-quality, good-paying U.S. jobs, precisely because they are free to develop links along their supply chains in places such as Mexico - in this case thanks to NAFTA. President Trump could even entertain the withdrawal of the United States from that central arbiter of international trade disputes, at which point the Mexican issue would become a global problem that would have to be confronted by the full international community.

"Trump suspends refugee entry, vows priority for Christians","A Pew Research Center study found that overall Christians and Muslims were admitted as refugees in about equal numbers in 2016, and far more Christians have been admitted since 2002. Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war and the rise of the Islamic State, many more Muslims than Christians have been killed or displaced because of the violence. The downsizing of the refugee program, which had grown under the Obama administration, fulfills Trump's campaign pledge to start the ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants and refugees, even though the United States already conducts the most rigorous and drawn-out screening process in the world. Refugee advocates slammed the order as cruel, while proponents of tighter immigration controls said it would protect Americans from radical Islamists who might try to sneak into the United States as refugees and launch an attack. ""The ban on refugees will severely cripple the U.S. refugee program, leaving thousands who face life-threatening danger without humanitarian protection,"" said Greg Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Pence: 'Life is winning again in America',"Vice president addresses annual antiabortion march in Washington Thousands of abortion opponents gathered in cold, blustery weather near the Washington Monument on Friday and heard Vice President Pence tell the annual March for Life that the Trump administration is determined to advance the fight against abortion. The massive crowd, bearing flags, banners and placards, then flowed down Constitution Avenue, filling the street, and rallied at the Supreme Court building, across from the Capitol. [...]he said that ""next week, President Donald Trump will announce a Supreme Court nominee who will uphold the God-given liberty enshrined in our Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia."" Scalia, a conservative associate justice of the Supreme Court, died last year. Pence, who has called himself an ""evangelical Catholic,"" has long been a hero among antiabortion activists and as governor of Indiana signed what were considered some of the nation's strictest laws on abortion. Earlier, Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, listed her four demands for Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress: lAppoint an antiabortion justice to the Supreme Court. lMake the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for many abortions in the United States, into a permanent law rather than the one-year provision that has been extended each year since 1976. lPass a law banning abortion nationwide after 20 weeks of pregnancy. lStop all federal funding for Planned Parenthood unless the organization stops performing abortions.

Why Trump's promises look like pie in the sky,"On a host of issues, including health care, trade and immigration, Trump began his presidency with executive orders intended to both placate and excite his base by keeping his bold campaign promises - in rhetoric, if not immediate, tangible results. Under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, the president or any other leaders must give six months' notice of his or her intention to withdraw. [...]specifying U.S.-made steel is a violation of the World Trade Organization agreement, except in cases of national security - which this is not. ""President Trump needs to go back to civics class, because he can direct his employees to do various things, but he cannot repeal a bunch of laws through his executive orders because he needs congressional consent - and the executive orders themselves say that,"" said Rena Steinzor, a professor at the University of Maryland's law school. [...]although there is broad consensus among Republicans about the need to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act - a process Trump began with an executive order the day he was sworn in - there is far less harmony on exactly when and how to handle the issue. David Axelrod, a former senior Obama adviser, pointed to Obama's executive order his first week in office to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, noting that he faced stiff congressional opposition and never completed his pledge.

Businesses have been reluctant to spend, given the lack of clarity about what the Trump administration might do in terms of economic policy, trade, government spending, immigration, corporate reforms and regulation, Bostjancic said. To reach that ambitious target, the United States will have to overcome significant challenges, such as a working-age population that is shrinking as baby boomers retire, and sluggish productivity growth, economists said.

"Some Republicans criticize travel ban, but others defend it","Facing intense criticism and dramatic news coverage of chaos and protests at airports worldwide, several congressional Republicans on Saturday questioned President Trump's order to halt admission to the United States by refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. ""To my colleagues: don't ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today,"" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) posted on Twitter along with the famous image of a toddler boy who had died in 2015 while his family fled Syria and whose body had washed up on Turkey's shore. [...]as cable news footage brought scenes Saturday of chaos at airports around the country, where business travelers, students and even legal U.S. residents were being barred entry, other Republicans began weighing in. [...]several congressional aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the executive order itself does not single out a preference for Christians, and the temporary travel ban is focused on areas where terrorism is a particular concern. Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer and House GOP policy director who waged an independent presidential bid in 2016, was one of a small number of Republicans to publicly oppose the ban.",1863068599,Newspapers," Snell, Kelsey

Day after Trump's order: Chaos,"A group of advocacy organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a legal action against the policy Saturday in New York, acting on behalf of two Iraqis who were stopped at the John F. Kennedy airport hours after the order was signed. Hours later, as protesters staged demonstrations at several airports around the country including JFK and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, a federal judge granted a request from the ACLU to stay deportations of those with valid visas detained on entry to the United States. The groups bringing the legal action, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry.

Security need or 'backdoor ban on Muslims'?,"Chicago immigration reform advocates and Muslim leaders denounced President Donald Trump's executive order to temporarily block refugees coming to the U.S. while the government reviews screening processes, calling it an effective ban on Muslims in America. In issuing the order -- which calls for a four-month halt on all refugee admissions, an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and a temporary moratorium on immigrants from countries that don't comply with security procedures -- The order ""will paint Islam as an enemy,"" added Sahloul, now an American citizen who has gone on two dozen medical missions to the Middle East since the start of the Syrian conflict. [...]the threat of terrorism warrants such an action, said James Carafano, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies for the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think tank. At a news conference Friday, Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Chicago, said refugees and others seeking haven in the U.S. ""don't choose to leave"" their home countries but are forced out by persecution or violence.

Judge halts deportations as refugee ban causes worldwide furor,"Judge Ann Donnelly of the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn granted a request from the American Civil Liberties Union to stop the deportations after determining that the risk of injury to those detained by being returned to their home countries necessitated the decision. Minutes after the judge's ruling in New York, another came in Alexandria when U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema issued a temporary restraining order to block for seven days the removal of any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport. [...]as the day progressed, administration officials confirmed that the sweeping order also targeted U.S. legal residents from the named countries - green-card holders - who were abroad when it was signed. Though several congressional Republicans denounced the order, the majority remained silent, and a few voiced crucial support - including, most prominently, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who had rejected Trump's anti-Muslim proposals during the campaign. According to the text of the order, the restriction applies to countries that have already been excluded from programs allowing people to travel to the United States without a visa because of terrorism concerns. A senior White House official later said that waivers will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and that green-card holders in the United States will have to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country. In a conference call with reporters, immigration lawyers and advocates said Trump's order violated the Constitution, along with U.S. and international laws that guarantee migrants the right to apply for...",1863770937,Newspapers," Markon, Jerry

Lives Rewritten With the Stroke of a Pen,"At 4:42 p.m. on Friday in Washington, when President Trump signed his executive order barring refugees from entering the United States and halting entry by citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries, he forcefully upended the lives of people who had waited, sometimes for years, for the travel documents that would let them into the United States. After the 2003 invasion, he was an interpreter for seven years, working for the American military and the United States Agency for International Development. A federal agent told him that his mother would be deported on a flight bound for Germany around 9 p.m. The agent offered to put Sgt. Alsaeedy's mother on the phone to say goodbye. [...]his mother was not deported. Joseph Goldstein Tareq Aqel Mohammed Aziz and Ammar Aziz Stranded in a foreign country When two brothers from Yemen landed at Dulles International Airport in Virginia on Saturday morning, they thought they would be connecting to Flint, Mich., to join their father. The two young men had immigrant visas, meaning they were approved for legal permanent residency, because their father, Aqel Muhammad Aziz, is a United States citizen. Because the United States embassy in Yemen has been closed since 2015, the brothers had to go to Djibouti to get their visas approved. Mr. al-Sabahi and his family came to the United States as refugees last year after he spent a decade working for the United States military in Iraq, a job that brought both Mr. al-Sabahi and his wife threats from...",1862684583,Newspapers," The New York Times

"U.S. Immigration Policy May Alienate Iraqis, Crucial Allies Against ISIS","Though he holds dual British and Iraqi citizenship, he said information he had received from the American Embassy in Baghdad indicated that he would not be allowed to travel to the United States in the coming weeks to participate in a long-planned conference, he said in a telephone interview from Iraq. [...]we ban their citizens?"" The order, which administration officials said was drafted without the input of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Middle East experts at the State Department, has offended the Iraqis in several respects. Yet another worry has been expressed by veterans, and even members of Mr. Trump's own party: that the order will interrupt the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have worked closely with the Americans and have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans who have been strongly supportive of the military, expressed concern that a strict application of the order might even block Iraqi pilots from coming to the United States for training. The more fundamental question is whether the White House can balance the fulfillment of a campaign promise to carry out...",1862685076,Newspapers," Gordon, Michael R

Visa Ban Leaves Artists in Limbo,"""Scholarly exchanges and international collaborations are key to our ongoing work, and we are very concerned that a number of programs we have in place could be threatened, just at a time when the world needs more, not less, exchange and mutual understanding,"" said Thomas P. Campbell, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Marcel Mettelsiefen, the director of ""Watani: My Homeland,"" an Oscar-nominated documentary, said the film's Syrian protagonist, Hala Kamil, would not be able to travel to the Oscars ceremony because she has a Syrian and a German refugee passport. Philip Himberg, the artistic director of the Sundance Institute Theater Program, said he feared the visa ban would shut down a fruitful workshop exchange for theater professionals from the Middle East and North Africa. Since it started in 2012, about 60 Arabic-language professionals have attended the workshops in Utah, Wyoming, Berlin and Morocco. Curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art said the order could disrupt or limit its loans to and from the affected countries and would restrict travel by colleagues and artists to the United States for education, research, fellowships, workshops, conferences and other training. Mr. Trump's move is ""particularly ironic, given that the earliest formulation of what we recognize today as the concept of habeas corpus was expressed in the Codex Hammurabi, an ancient Iraqi monument about justice, set up in public so that all citizens could access their rights,"" said Kim Benzel, the curator in charge of the museum's Department of Ancient Near Eastern...",1862686266,Newspapers," Donadio, Rachel

Confusion and Disorder at Airports as Travelers Are Detained Without Lawyers,"Drab airport screening areas and waiting rooms were transformed into chaotic scenes on Sunday, with lawyers saying that border agents had put pressure on detainees and created an information blackout that left many struggling to discern how President Trump's immigration order was being applied. [...]in the Washington area, agents told lawyers that officials had barred detainees from getting legal help, despite a federal judge's order that legal permanent residents be given access to lawyers. In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said, ""We are committed to ensuring that all individuals affected by the executive orders, including those affected by the court orders, are being provided all rights afforded under the law."" When two brothers from Yemen, Tareq Aqel Mohammed Aziz, 21, and Ammar, 19, landed on Saturday morning at Dulles International Airport near Washington with immigrant visas, they planned to board a connecting flight to Flint, Mich., to join their father. On Saturday night, after a federal judge in Brooklyn ruled the government could not remove travelers who had arrived with valid visas, she was put on a plane back to Europe, her lawyers said. Dr. Ahmadi, a general practitioner in the Australian city of Gold Coast and a dual citizen of Australia and Iran, arrived for a long-planned visit without the siblings' parents, who hold only Iranian passports and canceled their flights on Saturday. A federal judge in Alexandria, Va., on Saturday ordered government officials to give lawyers access to all legal permanent residents being detained at Dulles.",1862687134,Newspapers," Mueller, Benjamin

Officials fear move will set back efforts to fight terrorism,"Through inflammatory rhetoric and hastily drawn executive orders, the administration has alienated allies, including Iraq, provided propaganda fodder to terrorist networks that frequently portray U.S. involvement in the Middle East as a religious crusade and endangered critical cooperation from often-hidden U.S. partners - whether the leader of a mosque in an American suburb or the head of a Middle East intelligence service. An executive order - issued Friday and titled ""Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States"" - bans entry to people from a list of Muslim-majority nations including Iraq, where U.S. military and intelligence agencies have for years relied on cooperation from Iraqi and Kurdish authorities, not to mention thousands of individual translators and contractors. [...]Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement, ""In light of attempts by Islamic militant groups to infiltrate fighters into refugee flows to the West, along with Europe's tragic experience coping with this problem, the Trump Administration's executive order on refugees is a common-sense security measure to prevent terror attacks on the homeland."" Moqtada al-Sadr, an influential Shiite cleric, called the decision to block Iraqi entry while Americans still come and go ""arrogance,"" and he demanded that U.S. nationals leave the country. Iraqis also have questioned the omission from the travel ban of certain Gulf and North Africa countries, whose nationals have been involved in high-profile terrorist attacks Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for Abadi, said that the U.S. security partnership with Iraq, including American...",1862688816,Newspapers," Miller, Greg

Rulings Blocking Parts of Trump's Order Are the First Step on a Long Legal Path,"David Cole, the A.C.L.U.'s legal director, said the order from Judge Ann M. Donnelly of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn, which issued a nationwide injunction, was an important first step. ""The scariest scenario,"" said Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University, ""is one in which the Department of Homeland Security simply ignores the court orders. The New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, sent a letter to federal officials Sunday demanding information about those held at John F. Kennedy International Airport after receiving what he called ""alarming reports"" that the federal government was planning to violate the court order. Judge Donnelly, in Brooklyn, wrote that there was a strong likelihood that the two plaintiffs in the case, who seek to represent a class of refugees, visa holders and others, could establish that their removal would violate the Constitution's due process and equal protection guarantees. The order from Judge Leonie M. Brinkema of the Federal District Court in Alexandria applied only to legal permanent residents being held at Dulles International Airport.",1862690375,Newspapers," Liptak, Adam

"Byron Dobell, 89, Magazine Editor","Byron Dobell, an editor at Time-Life, Esquire and New York magazine who played a pivotal role in the careers of Tom Wolfe, Mario Puzo and other writers, died on Jan. 21 at his home in Manhattan. In the early 1960s Mr. Dobell (pronounced dough-BELL) was a managing editor at Esquire, under Harold Hayes, when Tom Wolfe approached the magazine offering to write about Southern California's subculture of car customizers. Early in his career, he was a picture editor at U.S. Camera, an associate editor at Popular Photography and a features editor at Pageant, a small-format general-interest monthly, and at This Week, a supplement for Sunday newspapers. After Rupert Murdoch bought New York magazine, Mr. Dobell returned for two tours of duty at Esquire, serving as editor in chief in 1977 and as a top-level editor under succeeding changes of ownership.

Congregations across U.S. hear messages of inclusion,"When Jesus talks about those who are striving for justice, think about the mothers and fathers standing over the dead bodies of children,"" preached Gench at the church in the denomination Trump affiliates that stands just three blocks from the White House. Are we willing to take risks on behalf of our faith?"" he asked. ""Because practicing intentional, even radical hospitality toward strangers is inherent to the Christian ethic."" Evangelical leaders - including the National Association of Evangelicals' World Relief organization and more than 100 prominent evangelicals who gathered at Wheaton College to discuss refugee issues in December - have largely denounced Trump's executive order. Evangelical attitudes are perhaps best reflected by a 2016 Southern Baptist Convention resolution that urged churches and families to welcome refugees while also calling on the government to ""implement the strictest security measures possible"" in screening them. If they don't love the country, why should we bring them here?"" Trump said that the new vetting system he plans to put in place during his 120-day stay on refugee admissions would prioritize religious minorities. ""Any proposal that preferences Christians over Muslims as refugees makes Catholic leaders nervous because it feeds that narrative that this is a war between the Christian West and the Muslims,"" said the Rev.

"In a Muslim enclave, torn families and Trump supporters at odds","Money had grown so tight in recent days she told them, that she was eating little more than small bits of bread and cheese. Since late Friday, when Trump ordered a ban on refugees, migrants and foreign nationals from Syria and six other majority-Muslim nations, few places have embodied the anger, pain and division like the Badats' newly adopted home in Southeast Michigan. The area surrounding Detroit boasts one of the largest Muslim communities in the nation; Hamtramck, an independent enclave in Detroit, has the country's only majority-Muslim city council. [...]Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes, largely on the strength of disaffected white auto and factory workers angry about their declining economic prospects and the immigrants and refugees who are reshaping their neighborhoods. At a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant in Warren, just north of Detroit, workers said they have been impressed by Trump's apparent resolve to renegotiate trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and to bolster American manufacturing. Since Friday night, Jondy, who also is a board member at the nonprofit organization United for a Free Syria, has heard from wives on vacation abroad and unable to return to their husbands in Michigan. In interviews at mosques, restaurants and cafes, Muslim residents said Trump's order had darkened their vision of America, the values it represents, its status as the one place in the world they can call home. The Badats escaped that carnage of Aleppo and spent three years in limbo in Turkey. Since...",1862695617,Newspapers," Friess, Steve

THE NATION; Trump's powerful political duo; Travel ban signals the intent by advisors Bannon and Miller to reshape the country.,"Miller, who developed detailed knowledge of the nation's immigration laws while working on the staff of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump's nominee to be attorney general, spent much of Saturday making policy decisions based on a strict interpretation of the immigration order and instructing senior Homeland Security officials on how to implement the plan.Regarding the status of permanent residents, Bannon and Miller at one point overruled an interpretation by Homeland Security officials in favor of a more limited policy that blocked green card holders until they apply for a waiver from the ban, the officials said.Former President George W. Bush kept his powerful strategist Karl Rove out of the Situation Room, where National Security Council meetings are usually held, Joshua Bolten, a White House chief of staff under Bush, said at a conference in September at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library in Austin, Texas.National security experts and even some Republican lawmakers believe that Trump's executive orders, which don't target citizens who have been involved in attacks against the U.S., are more likely to inflame resentment against the U.S. than to make the country more secure.",1862743526,Newspapers," Bennett, Brian

Police wary of new duty; Trump's order to use local units to enforce immigration laws elicits resistance by some L.A. officers.,"After Trump's unveiling last week of two executive orders that called for empowering local law enforcement officers to take on the duties of immigration agents, police officers and sheriff's deputies across the Los Angeles area said in interviews that enforcing immigration laws is not in their job descriptions.During the presidential election, Trump found support among some law enforcement officers who viewed him as more pro-police than his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.Trump's executive orders call for the resurrection of Secure Communities, a program from earlier in Obama's administration that asked jail officials to hand over inmates to immigration authorities, including inmates who had no criminal records and were guilty only of immigration violations.An Arizona law, Senate Bill 1070, tested the legal limits of what immigration enforcement duties police officers could perform.In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down most of the Arizona law but let stand a provision that required police to check the immigration status of someone they had already stopped if there was ""reasonable suspicion"" that the person was in the country illegally.After the presidential election, the LAPD's Central Division, which includes Hollenbeck, held a series of community meetings to reassure immigrants that police officers are there to help them, not deport them.",1862743774,Newspapers," Chang, Cindy

"CONFUSION REIGNS; Trump calls travel ban a success as chaos mounts on many fronts Thousands of protesters turn out at airports, and even top Republicans criticize the directive.","Even as the White House defended the directive's rollout as a success, advocacy groups and administration officials remained locked on an apparent collision course. Since its signing on Friday, the measure has led to the detention of more than 100 people landing at airports across the country with valid entry documents. [...]the emergency stay issued by a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Saturday represented an ""absolute base line"" prohibiting the removal of any of those who were halted upon arrival, said Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project. In Boston, where a judge's order appeared to guarantee landing rights to anyone with a valid visa during the coming week, legal observers were watching for a potential increase in arrivals. ""Prohibited travel will remain prohibited,"" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement, adding that the government retains the right to revoke visas on national security grounds. European leaders have expressed shock and dismay over Trump's directive, and some U.S. allies were taken aback by the blocked entry of their own nationals with dual passports from one of the affected countries in the presidential order. British news reports said Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had received White House assurances that the restrictions would apply only to dual-national British passport holders who were traveling from a country on the list. Lawyers countered that some enforcement went far beyond national security considerations, citing the blocked entry of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen with parents who held green cards; and...",1862743778,Newspapers," King, Laura

By nightfall, dozens had blocked traffic along the departures level of World Way -- the main thoroughfare that snakes through the airport -- and Assistant Los Angeles Police Chief Michael Moore used a megaphone to repeatedly ask protesters to move to the sidewalk. Attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and other public interest law groups raced to file court papers to release those being held. On Saturday, after mass demonstrations across the country, a federal judge in New York ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them ""irreparable harm.""

"You can't build a wall on a river; Border fence must be set back from Rio Grande, leaving some Texans on wrong side.","Robert Cameron drove his pickup truck toward the Texas-Mexico border, past cotton and sugar cane fields, up to a 20-foot-tall metal and concrete border fence -- and passed right through a gap in the barrier wide enough for a tractor-trailer. Because of international treaty and flood zone requirements, the fence is set back from the winding Rio Grande, and because it divides some U.S. properties, the fence is broken up by gaps Texas residents use to traverse their land. The fencing had to meet requirements of a 1970 treaty administered by the International Boundary and Water Commission, a joint U.S.-Mexican agency, which requires that structures built along the Rio Grande cannot disrupt its flow. To the east in Brownsville, near where the valley meets the Gulf of Mexico, the federal government seized land in 2009 to erect a stretch of fence on Eloisa Tamez's ancestral home, a Spanish land grant from 1767. Tamez, 81, a nursing professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, filed a federal lawsuit to stop the fence. Finding space will be a challenge in the Rio Grande Valley, where the river winds alongside homes, through wildlife refuges and parks. Chris Cabrera, vice president of the Rio Grande Valley chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents, said plugging gaps and extending the wall will work only if enough agents are sent to monitor it. On the riverbank below, Border Patrol agents spotted a smuggler launching a yellow rubber raft with...",1862744674,Newspapers," Hennessy-Fiske, Molly

THE WORLD; Mexico braces for uncertain era; Trump's tough talk on cross-border trade threatens to cut off region's lifeblood.,"For Mexican officials and global automakers, the dispiriting scene -- the site of Ford Motor Co.'s now-scrapped plans to build a $1.6-billion factory in central Mexico -- stands as the harbinger of a clouded future.Highway 57, which passes by sundry factory complexes en route to the northern industrial hub of Monterrey, has been dubbed the ""NAFTA Highway,"" after the landmark trade pact that went into effect Jan. 1, 1994, and prompted Mexico to abandon its protectionist trade policies.Sizable numbers of Japanese, German, South Korean, French and Italian factories are part of the mix, many producing parts for U.S.-bound autos.Throughout Mexico's export-oriented industrial zones, new housing developments line the highways of dusty towns-turned-industrial-hubs that churn out cars, refrigerators, air conditioners and other products for the U.S. market. ""Free trade made a lot of money for foreign companies and rich Mexicans, but it hasn't really helped the working classes,"" said David Rios, an independent union leader who was among labor activists in the central plaza of San Luis Potosi on a recent evening protesting the layoffs of state workers.The region, once a sleepy ranching and farming community, is home to a number of massive industrial parks and fueled by the steady growth in Mexican manufacturing of exports to the United States.; PHOTOGRAPHER:",1862744683,Newspapers," McDonnell, Patrick J

SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL; Prizing women's place in the story; 'I Don't Feel at Home' is a winner as feminist works and female artists share in awards.,"A Sundance Film Festival that was colored, gripped and sometimes overshadowed by the early days of the Donald Trump administration saw a slew of feminist films win big at the gathering's awards. [...]Eliza Hittman's gay-oriented coming-of-age story ""Beach Rats"" won the directing award for the U.S. dramatic section -- ensuring that a gathering that began with a march down Main Street that championed feminist values closed out with the same motif. Matt Rus-kin's tale of wrongful imprisonment, ""Crown Heights,"" about a real-life Trinidadian immigrant who fought for 20 years to exonerate his friend, took the audience award in the U.S. dramatic section, while ""Chasing Coral,"" Jeff Orlowski's environmentally oriented story about a disappearing natural resource, won for documentary. The world documentary grand jury prize went to Firas Fayyad and Steen Johannessen's Syria-themed ""Last Men in Aleppo""; the former made a plea to people in the U.S. to help fight for the rights of Syrians, noting a need for ""freedom and justice."" Later, the grand jury prize for world cinema dra-matic went to the Egypt-set ""The Nile Hilton Incident,"" a detective story set against the backdrop of the Arab Spring from director Tarik Saleh -- who told a story about a...",1862744701,Newspapers," Zeitchik, Steven

BONDS MADE CLOSER; Muslim Americans 'standing shoulder to shoulder',"The confusion and consternation after President Trump's order barring the entry of citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries has hit an established community of Southern California immigrants whose flight to this country was precipitated by the rise of a Muslim theocracy.[...]she said, she was ""released from prison.""Of the 87,000 people of Iranian ancestry who live in Los Angeles County, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, most trace their roots in this country to the Islamic revolution that overthrew the Western-oriented rule of Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1979. ""All of these folks are cultural or marginally practicing Muslims now standing shoulder to shoulder with the practicing Muslim community from Iraq and scores of other Muslim communities in Southern California,"" Syed said.Lalezarzadeh's mother worked her way through Pakistan and Vienna before gaining legal entry to the U.S. Her husband came on a visa and applied for political asylum when it expired.The 46-year-old assistant manager said that a co-worker who went to visit his mother in Iran was now stuck abroad, in limbo despite holding a green card.Zarang immigrated to the U.S. as a refugee nearly two decades ago, fleeing religious persecution in Iran because of his Bahai faith.DARIUSH ZARANG, 46, is assistant manager at the Farsi Cafe in L.A.

Confusion prevails at U.S. airports,"Miller, who developed detailed knowledge of the nation's immigration laws while working on the staff of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Trump's nominee to be attorney general, spent much of Saturday making policy decisions based on a strict interpretation of the immigration order and instructing senior Homeland Security officials on how to implement the plan.On one of the order's most controversial and confusing parts, the status of permanent residents, Bannon and Miller at one point overruled an interpretation by Homeland Security officials in favor of a more limited policy that blocked green card holders until they apply for a waiver from the ban, the officials said.Former President George W. Bush kept powerful strategist Karl Rove out of the Situation Room, where National Security Council meetings are usually held, Joshua Bolten, a White House chief of staff under Bush, said at a conference in September in Austin, Texas.",1862871742,Newspapers," Bennett, Brian

"Netanyahu applauds Trump's plan for wall, to Mexico's chagrin","JERUSALEM - JERUSALEM - On Saturday evening, Israel's prime minister tweeted his praise of President Trump's decision to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. In addition to border fences facing Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt, Israel also has an internal security fence - with remote-controlled machine guns - along the periphery of the Gaza Strip, as well as separation barriers in the West Bank to keep Palestinians, and Palestinian terrorists, out of Israel. Hours after Netanyahu's tweet, his office issued a clarification: ""The prime minister was addressing Israel's unique circumstances and the important experience we have and which we are willing to share with other nations. Mexico's Foreign Ministry ""expressed to the government of Israel, via its ambassador in Mexico, its profound astonishment, rejection and disappointment over Prime Minister Netanyahu's message on Twitter about the construction of a border wall.

Questions multiply over Bannon's rolein decision,"[...]even as the mechanism for full consultation with defense, diplomatic, intelligence and other national security chiefs remains incomplete, Bannon's policy influence was established late Saturday in a presidential directive that gave him something no previous president has bestowed on a political adviser: a formal seat at the NSC table. While they are listed as attendees to meetings of the NSC - the highest decision-making body, chaired by the president - the directive says they will attend meetings of the national security principals meeting without Trump ""where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed."" The directive, based on a template that all modern presidents have used in organizing national security decision-making, changed a number of things from the Obama White House. Outside the White House, reaction to the new NSC organizational directive was less positive, with some saying that the immigration directive suffered from jumping ahead of the normal policy process, allowing it and other orders to be composed by political operatives such as Bannon and Stephen Miller, the White House senior adviser for policy, who is a Bannon ally and a former aide to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump's populist and conservative nominee for attorney general. According to several people familiar with their relationship, Bannon has cultivated a rapport with Trump over security issues in recent months, and impressed Trump with his grasp of policy in talks they have held together with top intelligence and military officials.",1863155671,Newspapers," DeYoung, Karen

"As they become Americans, a mix of elation and worry","The preamble?""

[...]a screen rolled down for a video called ""Faces of America,"" and music began playing over a photo montage of a woman in a headscarf, a man wearing lederhosen, the Statue of Liberty, kids smiling out from a crowded boat landing at Ellis Island.

Democratic officials across the U.S. build off protests kindled by their base,"Opposition moves include slowing Cabinet picks, legislating on immigration Democrats spent the weekend building a full-scale opposition push against President Trump's executive order banning entry into the United States for refugees, migrants and even green-card holders from seven mostly Muslim countries. Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) are inviting all Democratic lawmakers to join them at 6 p.m. Monday on the steps of the Supreme Court to show solidarity with legal attempts to block Trump's travel ban. [...]in an interview, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said he would introduce legislation to overturn Trump's order by forcing him to comply with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin. Details of the legislative proposals were still being sorted out Sunday afternoon, but most are likely to be introduced by Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has oversight of refugee and immigrants' rights issues, aides said. Democratic leaders also were exploring the options for holding more public events to draw attention to the opposition to Trump's orders - with the party seeking once again to tap into the anger that has driven millions of Americans into the streets. Jerrold Nadler and Nydia M. Velazquez, who represent parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, showed up at John F. Kennedy International Airport and helped activists and attorneys seek the quick release of green-card holders and refugees stuck in legal limbo upon U.S. arrival. In the House, Rep.

Denied entry,"Iranfard, who goes by Ellie, has had legal permanent residency for two years, but her green card didn't help her Friday when she tried to get on a flight, any flight, to the United States. For two sleepless days, Kargaran said, he has tried desperately to get information from airlines, government officials, friends and family. At one point, he staked out a part of San Francisco International Airport where Customs and Border Protection officers take their break. What he was hearing now, as friends advised him to scrub from his phone any social-media posts that suggested that he disagreed with Trump, reminded him of the Iranian repression that drove him from the country.

An alarming national security shake-up,"The document sounds like a simple bureaucratic shuffle, outlining the shape the National Security Council will take under President Trump. The idea of the National Security Council (NSC), established in 1947, is to ensure that the president has the best possible advice from his Cabinet, the military and the intelligence community before making consequential decisions, and to ensure that, once those decisions are made, a centralized mechanism exists to guarantee their effective implementation. Organizing the NSC this way does not reflect well on national security adviser Michael Flynn - whether the bad decision is a result of his lack of understanding of what the NSC should do or because he is giving in to pressure from his boss. [...]elevating Bannon is a sign that there will be more than one senior official in Trump's inner circle with top-level national security responsibility, an arrangement nearly certain to create confusion going forward....",1863156641,Newspapers," Rothkopf, David J

A psychological and emotional toll on would-be immigrants and refugees,"From Europe to the Middle East, politicians who condemned the travel bans said they were unjustified, would do little to combat terrorism and would bring more woes to the most vulnerable people in the world. ""The chancellor regrets the entry ban imposed by the U.S. government against refugees and nationals from certain countries,"" read a statement issued by the office of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The Iranian speaker of parliament, Ali Larijani, said that the decision to ban citizens of the seven Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Sudan - was ""hasty"" and based on fear, according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency. The outspoken Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose militia once battled the U.S. occupation of Iraq following the 2003 invasion, released a statement Sunday calling for American nationals to be expelled. Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, said that Iraq hopes that the new procedures won't damage the relationship between Baghdad and Washington. [...]Turkey's deputy prime minister, Mehmet Simsek, said on Twitter on Sunday that refugees are welcome in Turkey, ""the world's largest refugee hosting country.",1863161871,Newspapers," Raghavan, Sudarsan

"Order violates Constitution and a 1965 law, scholars say","16 state attorneys general predict courts will strike down Trump's measure President Trump's executive order on immigration, parts of which have already been put on hold by several federal judges, is likely to face a series of new legal challenges about whether it violates a 1965 anti-discrimination law and the Constitution, scholars said Sunday. A host of groups are gearing up for legal battle, including the American Civil Liberties Union, which won the injunction from a New York judge Saturday, immigrant legal aid societies, public-interest groups and the alliance of 16 state attorney generals. Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, issued a statement Sunday saying he and his colleagues in 15 other states representing 130 million Americans and foreign residents ""are confident that the Executive Order will ultimately be struck down by the courts."" Donnelly wrote in her order that she ruled in the ACLU's favor because it has ""a strong likelihood of success in establishing that the removal of the petitioner and others similarly situated violates their rights to Due Process and Equal Protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution.""

"Trump stands by order as confusion, dissent swirl","PRESIDENT: 'This is not a Muslim ban' Mixed signals sent on green cards, enforcement President Trump's executive order temporarily prohibiting entry into the United States for migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and for refugees from around the world fueled confusion, angst and a wave of protests across the country Sunday. Even as the president and other top advisers defended the ban, some Trump officials appeared on Sunday to walk back one of the most controversial elements of the action: its impact on green-card holders, who are permanent legal residents of the United States. In a separate statement, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly was less definitive, suggesting that green-card holders' status would help them gain entry to the country but that they nonetheless would be subject to a ""case-by-case"" review. ""Prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,"" the agency said in a statement. The president's far-reaching action triggered a wave of criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, who plan to assemble Monday on the steps of the Supreme Court in a show of solidarity with legal attempts to block Trump's travel ban. [...]at least one House member said he plans to introduce legislation to overturn Trump's action by forcing him to comply with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.

Most frequently, lawyers worked to file habeas corpus petitions in federal court challenging the detention of specific individuals. The spontaneous rush to help, spurred in part by social media, echoed the protests that arose at numerous airport terminals, cities and the White House opposing Trump's ban on travelers from seven countries. The immigrant rights community braced for a legal fight with the Trump administration over the order banning entry to the United States for refugees, migrants and foreign nationals from seven mostly Muslim countries. Late Saturday, the American Civil Liberties Union won a nationwide temporary injunction against the order from a federal judge in Brooklyn. An email circulating in the Washington-area legal community illustrated the hardship at Washington Dulles International Airport, where lawyers were still being prevented from talking to detainees as of Sunday afternoon in contravention of a court order.",1863179212,Newspapers," Viebeck, Elise

""Because our country was not on the list, we were able to travel,"" Formukong said.

Confusion prevails at U.S. airports,"President Donald Trump defended his new immigration crackdown on Sunday as a stand against terrorism that will improve American national security, even as the White House appeared to back away from a key element amid the chaos at U.S. airports. The statement came after the White House -- facing a backlash from lawmakers, including some Republicans -- appeared to back down on one piece of the new immigration order, signaling that travelers trying to enter the country from the seven banned countries -- White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said that these legal permanent residents are exempt from the travel ban ""moving forward,"" even though over the weekend other administration officials said the rule did apply to them.

Make China Great Again,"ISIS wants to eliminate the world's ""gray zone,"" the places where Muslims, Christians, Hindus and Jews live in harmony. The president of the United States himself now seems to agree that Muslims and non-Muslims can't live together. Besides the immorality and apparent illegality of Trump's order, it's worth weighing the strategic effects as well. ""The end result of this ban will not be a drop in terror attacks,"" as dozens of American diplomats wrote, in a dissenting draft memo that leaked. The United States already has few barriers to Asian imports, which is why some combination of your car, television, computer, phone and clothing comes from Asia. If China succeeds, it will gain more sway in Asia, as will a more bare-knuckle economic system in which copyrights, worker rights, product safety and the environment aren't taken very seriously.",1862941037,Newspapers," Leonhardt, David

"" ""For tech leaders, it's a work force issue,"" said Michael Schutzler, the chief executive of the Washington Technology Industry Association, a trade group representing the state's technology companies. Technology companies are bracing for another executive order, expected to be signed by Mr. Trump soon, that could affect them further with changes to the system for issuing visas to foreign workers.

Lawyers Join Forces and Fan Out to Fight Trump Policies,"The calls and emails went out a little past 10 p.m. Friday, rippling through an informal network of current and former Yale Law School students who had worked at the school's immigrant rights advocacy clinic. Several leaders of the effort said their hope is that the judiciary may serve as a strong check to a government controlled by Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress across a broad range of anticipated fights. (The litigation joins a lawsuit filed last week arguing that Mr. Trump's ownership of businesses that take payments from foreign governments violates the Constitution.) Propelling the effort is an outpouring of financial support and volunteers that legal rights group leaders say dwarfs the campaign that gradually emerged to counter the George W. Bush administration's post-Sept. 11 national security policies, including detention without trial at the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. [...]Nan Aron, the president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, which focuses on judicial nominations, said in the past her group has had trouble getting support from corporate law firms that seek to avoid entanglement in politics, but since the election, several ""major"" ones -- she would not name them -- have volunteered their services to research...",1862976942,Newspapers," Savage, Charlie

Mosque Killings Force Canadians to Confront a Strain of Intolerance,"The attack was particularly shocking for Quebec City, where the bulk of the population of 750,000 works for the provincial government, universities or in tourism. [...]Sunday there had not been any murders in the city for 21 months. Even outspoken critics of the religion recoiled at the prospect that an increasingly acrimonious debate over rising Islamic immigration may have contributed to the violence. Kellie Leitch, a conservative member of Parliament who has proposed screening immigrants for ""Canadian values,"" issued a statement calling the attack ""not just on those gathered in a house of worship but on the very fabric of Canadian society."" In 2005, the province became the first to explicitly ban the use of Shariah law and, less than a decade later, the Parti Québécois government tried to pass a ""charter of values"" that would have banned provincial employees from wearing Muslim head scarves and other ""overt"" religious symbols. Quebec City, meanwhile, is a conservative bastion within the province and home to right-leaning radio talk shows that push an anti-Islam agenda -- unusual for Canadian broadcasters. [...]other leaders at the mosque said there have been hate letters, and swastikas painted on its door, episodes that led to the installation...",1862981032,Newspapers," Austen, Ian

Relationship Recast as U.S. Turns Away,"For more than a quarter-century, since the first Persian Gulf war in 1991, the United States military has been involved in Iraq. Through the most difficult times -- when sectarian violence was tearing the country apart, when revelations came of torture by Americans at the Abu Ghraib prison -- there were always the personal interactions between Iraqis and Americans, nurtured against the backdrop of war. Mr. Trump has explained his executive order as a way to keep America safe from terrorism, but officials and analysts say that it is likely to hinder his efforts to wipe out the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL, given that the United States is leaning on the Iraqis to do most of the fighting. The issue could also become a political liability for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who has spoken optimistically about expanding cooperation between Iraq and the United States under Mr. Trump in the fight against ISIS. Other leaders, including the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, and the spokesman for Iraq's paramilitary units that have been fighting the Islamic State, said that Americans should be barred from Iraq. Henri J. Barkey, the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that the barring of Iraqis from the United States would work against American efforts to stabilize Iraq once the Islamic State was defeated.",1862985633,Newspapers," Arango, Tim

Allied Leaders Extend a Hand at Their Peril,"Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain had just left Washington on Friday evening after a tense but successful first visit with President Trump for a 10-hour flight to Ankara, Turkey, for her next awkward encounter, with the increasingly autocratic Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The danger of playing nice with Mr. Trump should come as little surprise to his country's allies. Besides campaigning on an ""America First"" platform, he has regularly argued that allies have been taking the United States for a ride, in trade, security and financial terms. Last year, in the name of conciliation and dialogue, he invited Mr. Trump to Mexico, a somewhat questionable move given Mr. Trump's contempt for Mexico and his promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, raise tariffs, deport millions of Mexicans, and build (or finish) a border wall and make the southern neighbor of the United States pay for it. The Trump effect has been felt even in Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has come under criticism for saying it is not his job to comment on the domestic policies of other countries. Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular in the country, but as Mr. Trudeau's father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, once said, proximity to America ""is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant; no matter how friendly or temperate the beast, one is affected by every twitch and grunt."" Canada was able to get quick clarification from the White House that the directive would not affect the...",1862985798,Newspapers," Erlanger, Steven

"He Was Sent Back to Iran. Now, a Court Says the U.S. Must Readmit Him.","[...]thanks to a court order, he is the only foreigner who was refused entry after President Trump issued a travel ban and has since been given permission to return to the United States. [...]the ruling, by a United States District Court judge, Dolly M. Gee, is one of the most aggressive actions a federal judge has taken against the executive order. Judge Gee held that barring Mr. Vayeghan's entry likely violated immigration law and the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. [...]that White House officials walked back a provision that included green-card holders in the ban, the brothers were feeling the sting of its impact.

Acting attorney general fired over ban Justice Dept. says it won't defend immigration order,"TOLD department not to defend order U.S. prosecutor in Virginia named in her place President Trump fired acting attorney general Sally Yates on Monday night after she ordered Justice Department lawyers not to defend his immigration order temporarily banning entry into the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from around the world. A Justice Department official said that hours after Yates released her memo refusing to defend the president's executive order, she was delivered a one-line letter from the head of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel saying that she had been removed. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, who worked on one of the legal challenges, said of Yates's memo, ""It sends a very strong message that there's something very wrong with the Muslim ban."" George J. Terwilliger III, a deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, said Yates's memo was a ""foolish, naked political move by what appears to be an ambitious holdover official"" that would only create ""unnecessary disorder."" (Amazon owner Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post and has voiced Amazon's opposition to the order personally.) White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that one lawsuit ""doesn't make any sense"" and sought to minimize the action as simply subjecting 109 people to more rigorous screening. According to State Department statistics, about 90,000 people received nonimmigrant or immigrant visas in fiscal year 2015 from the seven countries affected by Trump's executive order. matt.zapotosky@washpost.com...",1863404738,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

Possible new role for Koch network: Resistance movement within the GOP,"The weekend gathering of wealthy donors who help finance the conservative Koch network was supposed to serve as a celebration of the policy victories within reach now that Republicans control Washington: a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, a rollback of environmental regulations, perhaps even a corporate tax overhaul. The mixed emotions on display here reflect a provocative role for the Koch network in the age of Trump - as a potent resistance movement within the GOP, well positioned to fight the president and his allies on Capitol Hill when they push policies that run counter to the group's libertarian credo. The network could present a political dilemma for many GOP lawmakers ahead of the 2018 midterm elections as they choose between two influential forces within the party, a populist wing buoyed by Trump's ""America First"" call and the well-organized, well-funded Koch-aligned activists who embrace open trade. The Koch operation counts several highly placed allies within the Trump administration, including Vice President Pence; Scott Pruitt, the nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency; and Marc Short, a former top Koch official who is serving as the White House legislative liaison.

"Many Catholic leaders, supporting refugees, condemn Trump's travel order","'Like others, we have been on the other side of such decisions' President Trump, who won the majority of Catholic votes, is facing fierce opposition from Catholic bishops and nonprofit leaders who are issuing strongly worded statements condemning his executive order on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from around the world. Under the Obama administration, some international religious freedom advocates say Christians and Yizidis who were targeted by the Islamic State were marginalized in key U.S.-supported United Nations aid programs. ""Pope Francis was among the first to decry ISIS' genocide against religious minorities, so the fact that the executive order gives refugee priority to individual claims from persecuted religious minorities, whether Christian, Yizidi or Muslim, is welcome news,"" Nina Shea, who is Catholic and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said in an email. ""Any proposal that preferences Christians over Muslims as refugees makes Catholic leaders nervous because it feeds that narrative that this is a war between the Christian West and the Muslims,"" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit who sits on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom - an independent government commission. Bestowing honorary degrees on presidents is a tradition for Notre Dame and caused a stir when the Catholic university issued one to President Obama when he spoke at commencement, given his support for abortion rights.

Trump's actions could affect L.A. Olympic bid,"Garcetti, a Democrat and one of the prominent faces of the city's Olympic bid, spoke with Trump on the phone shortly after the presidential election, at which time the soon-to-be president pledged to help attract the Summer Games to the United States. Trump already has had a phone call with IOC President Thomas Bach, and some U.S. Olympic officials have been buoyed by his enthusiasm for Los Angeles' bid, even if they aren't certain whether he is a help or hindrance in the process. Officials with the U.S. Olympic Committee spent the weekend trying to understand the ramifications of the travel ban. The USOC said in a statement Monday afternoon that the organization has received assurances from federal officials that they ""will work with us to ensure that athletes and officials from all countries will have expedited access to the United States in order to participate in international athletic competitions....",1863427620,Newspapers," Maese, Rick

High Commissioner for Refugees said Monday that 20,000 people in precarious conditions would be banned from traveling to the United States under the 120-day suspension on refugee admissions that was announced Friday.

Christian Syrians in U.S. echo Trump's concerns,"Hookah smoke drifted through the restaurant as Elias Shetayh and Aziz Wehbey spoke intently about their support for President Trump, whose temporary halt on immigration from war-torn Syria - their homeland - had touched off a political firestorm. Elias Shetayh's view is a common refrain up and down the 6th Ward, where many agree with Trump's decision to end the Syrian refugee program, even as they dispute the wisdom of his blanket ban on all legal immigration from Syria as too extreme. The national conversation about the U.S. position on accepting refugees of the Syrian civil war has hit a fever pitch in the days since Trump signed an order halting the program, amid fears that along with refugees, terrorists will seek to surreptitiously enter the country. Like other pro-Trump Syrian Americans in Allentown, Younes was frustrated by President Barack Obama's calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down. There remains a strong sense among many of the Syrians in Allentown that Assad led the country reasonably and that things were going in the right direction before the civil war. The Younes family's story is typical for immigrants in Allentown; they arranged U.S. residency through family connections and marriage and in turn helped other family members enter the United States as permanent residents, including Mouna Younes's mother. Many in the community believe that the U.S. government will make exceptions for Christian Syrians, particularly those with family members already in the United States.",1863441076,Newspapers," DelReal, Jose A

PERSPECTIVE; Journey from rhetoric to real,"Two more guards arrived, eyed me, inspected my papers and led me to a room. Days before I landed in December 2002, the Iranian government had ordered that American journalists be fingerprinted and questioned on entering the country. Bursts of Farsi crackled around me; the guards appeared to be giving advice to the man with the ink. The commander sighed and, wanting to regain control of the situation, ordered tea. Farhadi's decision came after President Trump's executive order to suspend the U.S. refugee program and temporarily prohibit entry to citizens of seven predominantly Muslim nations. In a statement directed at Trump and Iran's religious conservatives, he said: ""For years on both sides of the ocean, groups of hard-liners have tried to present to their people unrealistic and fearful images of various nations and cultures in order to turn their differences into disagreements, their disagreements into enmities and their enmities into fears.

Ban leaves global firms hanging; Trump's immigration order creates chaos for businesses with foreign-born workers.,"For all Trump's campaigning about how his business acumen would boost the economy and help entrepreneurs, company founders such as Eslami were quick to point to the chaos that Friday's executive order has created for them. The Department of Homeland Security said Sunday that green card holders from the seven Muslim-majority countries affected by the order would be able to reenter the country, but the rushed implementation has left many with a sense of uncertainty about whether they will be turned away at the border. Some executives, like Husayn Kassai, chief executive of British background check start-up Onfido, find irony in how an administration that pledged on the campaign trail to help create jobs may wind up doing the exact opposite. Soroush Pour, a software engineer who is a citizen of Iran and Australia and has lived in the U.S for seven years on a visa, booked a trip to visit Australia in February to attend a wedding. Over the weekend, he was advised by immigration attorneys to avoid traveling outside the U.S. ""I love the company I work for, and I love living in the Bay Area, but it's hard for me to go through this visa process, and...",1863452168,Newspapers," Lien, Tracey

THE NATION; ANALYSIS; Early missteps mark path ahead; Refugee ban's botched rollout underscores the risks of Trump's go-it-alone approach.,"The botched weekend rollout of a refugee and travel ban was reminiscent of President Obama's stumbling introduction of his healthcare website and President George W. Bush's tortured response to Hurricane Katrina.First is the danger of defying the normal niceties of Washington.Consulting and gaining feedback from more experienced hands, including those on Capitol Hill and the administration's own departments, could have smoothed out problems privately and prepared agencies to implement and defend the new travel policy.Ignoring the sharp divisions in the land, Trump again focused on pushing a policy that is popular with his own voters but that breeds suspicion among those who did not support him, further cementing the nation's political divide.[...]as yet there has been no public talk by the administration of homegrown terrorists, who have been assailants in recent attacks including the Boston marathon bombings, the San Bernardino shooting and the Orlando, Fla., nightclub shooting.Television screens blared with scenes of elderly, wheelchair-bound travelers and, in one case, a 5-year-old child, being released after hours in custody.Trump's campaign benefited from a deep desire for change among American voters, particularly in the rural and industrial areas that secured the presidency for him.",1863458978,Newspapers," Decker, Cathleen

Acting attorney general canned,"President Donald Trump fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates Monday night, after Yates ordered Justice Department lawyers Monday not to defend his immigration order temporarily banning entry into the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from around the world. The National Immigration Justice Center, along with the Chicago chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, issued an advisory Monday telling U.S. residents from those targeted countries to expect hourslong questioning at the airport and that their phones, email and social media accounts may be checked. On Monday, in what could be the first volley in an intense legal battle, Bob Ferguson, Washington state's attorney general, said he plans to file a federal lawsuit seeking an immediate halt to the order's implementation. The House Judiciary Committee is confirming that committee staff worked with Trump administration officials as they drafted an executive order temporarily halting the nation's refugee program. Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly fumed privately to associates over the weekend because they had been caught unaware by a travel ban that was drafted and set into action largely in secret by the White House, according to three people who have spoken with them.

THE WORLD; Iraqis feel betrayed by travel ban; Their nation's army has been fighting side by side with Americans against Islamist extremism.,"American forces are backing Iraqi and Kurdish fighters as they seek to drive Islamic State militants from Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul. ""Iraq is on the front line of the war on terrorism,"" the parliament's foreign committee said in a statement Monday.In comments directed at the Trump administration, Muqtada Sadr, a powerful Shiite cleric and political leader, said on his website, ""It would be arrogance for you to enter freely Iraq and other countries while barring to them the entrance to your country ... and therefore you should get your nationals out.""The Pentagon, which has 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, was seeking to shield Iraqi citizens who have worked with the U.S. military from the travel ban, compiling a list of Iraqis it will recommend for exemption.Experts said any move to seize oil reserves as spoils of war would have been in violation of international law, but Trump -- who had floated the idea during his campaign -- brought it up again after taking office.To many inside and outside Iraq, the travel ban posed the potential to undercut the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State, and at the very least provided a propaganda gift to jihadist supporters.",1863460177,Newspapers," King, Laura

"Mexico's a great neighbor, for now","Migration between both countries, contrary to what you hear on the nativist media outlets that created the receptive swamp for Trump's campaign narrative, has been an asset for the North American economy. Trump is making much of the roughly $60-billion trade deficit the U.S. runs with Mexico, but let's not lose sight of the fact that Mexico is now the second-largest purchaser of American goods, to the tune of $236 billion in 2015. Under Pena Nieto, Mexico has also enacted politically sensitive reforms to its energy sector that are hugely beneficial to U.S. business and national security interests, and opened other sectors of its economy to American investment. Ours is the only great continental power in history to have the luxury of not having to deploy the bulk of its military to protect its borders -- despite the fact that we snatched away half of Mexican territory in a 19th...",1863463136,Newspapers," Martinez, Andres

PROTESTING TRAVEL BAN; 'Not succumbing to that fear' on campus; Leaders voice strong dissent as directive throws students and faculty into turmoil.,"President Trump's recent executive order imposing a 90-day ban on entry into the United States from seven Muslim-majority nations is roiling universities across California and the nation, fueling deep anxiety about the future of international academic exchange. Napolitano, who served as U.S. Homeland Security secretary in the Obama administration, said an extensive screening process already exists, and Trump is needlessly jeopardizing academic collaboration. The majority of them are from Iran, with 1,286 visas issued to them in 2015, according to U.S. Department of Homeland Security data compiled by College Factual, a New York-based firm that analyzes higher-education data.

"OBITUARIES; WILLIAM A. NORRIS, 1927 - 2017; Ruling expanded gay rights","William A. Norris, a former federal appeals court judge who wrote an iconic ruling on gay rights long before same-sex marriage entered the lexicon, has died. While serving on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, William Norris, who was appointed by President Carter, authored a majority decision that said gays had the same constitutional protections as racial minorities. Norris' ruling has been described as the first to use an equal-protection analysis in the context of gay rights. Norris helped build a thriving appellate practice at the Akin Gump law firm after leaving the court and served as a confidante to many public officials. In addition to his wife and Kim Norris, Norris is survived by his son, Don Norris; two other daughters, Barbara and Alison Norris; stepchildren David Jelenko, Jill Bauman, James Weister and Joni Martino; two grandchildren, Nathan and Semantha Norris; and a sister, Dorothy Lankford. -- maura.dolan@latimes.com...",1863466784,Newspapers," Dolan, Maura

"Finding their voices; More companies regard speaking out against the White House as a moral, fiscal imperative","A growing number of companies are deciding it's a bigger risk to their investors and bottom line to stay quiet than it is to protest Trump's ban on refugees and travel from seven Muslim-majority nations, betting vocal opposition to the executive order scores them a moral and fiscal victory. [...]on Monday, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and Chief Executive Mark Fields criticized the refugee ban, saying in a statement: ""We do not support this policy or any other that goes against our values as a company."" Other executives who have spoken out against the White House include Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings and, to some astonishment, Lloyd Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, who told employees over voicemail that the executive order was at odds with the company's diversity practices. Despite issuing a statement criticizing the order Saturday afternoon, the bad PR metastasized that evening into a boycott, with the hashtag #DeleteUber trending after the ride-hailing giant publicized its continued operations at Kennedy International Airport in New York following a taxi strike protesting the immigration order.

Here, more than 120 miles from the border, Arizona voters outraged with President Obama's executive orders that welcomed the foreign-born to America are delighted with Trump's first week in office, when his actions seemed to have done the opposite.

LETTERS,"Defending Muslims Re ""Confusion reigns,"" Jan. 30 To President Trump's ban on travel to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries -- which harkens back to a dark period in Europe when German soldiers asked, "" Ausweis, bitte,"" (""papers, please"") -- let's instead look to the German words of another American president who said, "" Ich bin ein Berliner."" Neil Snow Manhattan Beach :: Your articles have mentioned the effect this ban may have on teaching hospitals and training new physicians.

Democrats prepare to impede Trump however they can,"The Senate Finance Committee is expected to consider the former Goldman Sachs banker on Tuesday, at the same time it will vote on the nomination of Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. On Monday, the Senate voted on a key procedural step toward the nomination of former ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, with four members of the Democratic caucus supporting him - Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Angus King (I-Maine), Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.). How far Democrats go will be closely watched by the liberal activists who joined them to protest Trump's ban Monday night on the steps of the Supreme Court. [...]when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told the crowd, ""What the president did is not constitutional,"" one protester retorted: ""You're not doing anything if you don't stop Sessions!"" Meanwhile, statements from top-ranking Republicans in the House and Senate were at odds with comments earlier in the day from White House press secretary Sean Spicer. A member of Grassley's committee staff worked alongside other congressional staffers to assist the Trump transition team on legislative issues, including early drafting of the executive order, said one Senate GOP aide. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who faces a 2018 reelection bid in a swing state, sent a letter to transportation secretary nominee Elaine Chao on Monday with seven questions about enforcement of the ban.

"PROTESTING TRAVEL BAN; Pro-immigrant, pro bono; Attorneys volunteer to help those detained at LAX under Trump's ban","Scanning her emails, Inlender saw an emergency plea from a refugee assistance organization asking for attorneys to help people being detained by border officials at U.S. airports. Many, like Inlender, are part of a battle-tested network of advocacy groups in Los Angeles that has been working for years without fanfare on immigration issues, and now they have suddenly found themselves in the international spotlight as they push back against the president's action. [...]veteran advocates and attorneys who tried to organize the outpouring of help described a frenetic, largely improvised effort that was thwarted badly by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials who refused to allow attorneys to see people being detained and released no information on the detainees. Inlender said she responded to an email from one nonprofit, the International Refugee Assistance Project, that sought volunteers for a legal rapid response team should the need arise. White House officials initially said it applied as well to people with green cards, which give them legal status as residents in the country. The Playa Vista attorney, who normally handles cases involving technology and transactions, drove to LAX on Monday after reading news reports of the prolonged detentions and deportations of people that continued after federal judges in Los Angeles and elsewhere issued emergency stays against the executive order.

An Afghan national traveling on an SIV was detained briefly Friday at San Francisco International Airport while his wife and children were allowed through, said Matt Zeller, an Afghanistan veteran and founder of No One Left Behind, a nonprofit group that helps Afghan and Iraqi combat interpreters resettle in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers held the Afghan man for several hours because they were unclear on which nationalities were subject to the ban, Zeller said. The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of Darweesh and another Iraqi detainee, winning a judgment late Saturday that blocked the deportation of visa holders. Trump's nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, is one of the harshest critics of the visa program and has argued that it should be killed. ""If that's the prevailing narrative, how are we ever going to find allies in future conflicts or humanitarian situations around the world if we don't keep our word to leave no one behind?""

White House aides see travel ban as just a start; A dark view of immigrants fuels their radical experiment,"Even as confusion, internal dissent and widespread condemnation greeted President Trump's travel ban and crackdown on refugees this weekend, senior White House aides say they are only getting started.The administration faced down another torrent of criticism Monday -- from fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill, career diplomats, national security experts and world leaders -- over the hasty rollout of the order, as well as the message it sent to both friends and adversaries in the war on terrorism.The Pentagon, with written support from Republican military veterans serving in Congress, began compiling a list of Iraqi citizens who have worked with the armed forces and is recommending that they be exempt from Trump's temporary ban on entry to the U.S. by people from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries:Despite the backlash, senior White House officials maintain that the ban is popular with Trump's voters, though no reputable polling on the question has been released since Friday.Senior GOP staff on the House and Senate judiciary committees helped write a version of the executive order on their own time during Trump's transition.The trio, who make up part of Trump's inner circle, have a dark view of refugee and immigration flows from majority-Muslim countries, believing that if large numbers of Muslims are allowed to enter the U.S., parts of American cities will begin to replicate disaffected and disenfranchised immigrant neighborhoods in France, Germany and Belgium that have been home to perpetrators of terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years.",1863527776,Newspapers," Bennett, Brian

IOC's 2024 vote not free of politics; President Trump's travel ban is only one issue that voters will have to consider.,"While the global debate over President Trump's travel ban has heightened concerns that International Olympic Committee members might turn away from L.A., problems have arisen in Budapest.

Even Paris -- seen as a slight favorite in the three-city race -- could face pushback as Marine Le Pen, head of the far-right National Front party, runs for president on an anti-immigration platform.

Congolese Family Warmly Embraced at a Precarious Time for Refugees,"At Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday afternoon, a refugee family of five arrived on an 18-hour flight from Africa and, unlike others who had hoped to enter the country over the weekend, was soon standing outside the airport, watching as snow fell like confetti. According to a State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity, the order allowed for exemptions to admit refugees ""when in the national interest and when they do not pose a risk to U.S. security or welfare, including for certain religious minorities and certain refugees in transit."" The family was heading north to the Hudson Valley, where Christ Episcopal Church and Vassar College -- both in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. -- had arranged for their resettlement. Customs and Border Police, which in the previous two days had detained visa holders and permanent residents in what was a scene of chaos at airports worldwide, asked Masu several questions about his reasons for leaving Congo, his line of work and his family. A German history professor at Vassar College, Maria Höhn, first had the idea in 2015 and consulted with a refugee group in Connecticut that was working with Church World Service.",1863330693,Newspapers," Robbins, Liz

"Honey, Soap and Towels: Signs of Welcome That a Refugee Family Will Not See","In other cities and towns, apartments were rented, furnished and made ready, some by faith groups, some by neighbors. At that local, practical level, executive orders on refugees are not baffling pronouncements, indifferent to human needs, but shopping lists for dish detergent and diapers and too many rolls of paper towel. The Syrian family bound for Connecticut had been living in Jordan since leaving Syria in 2013, said Ghassan Atohmashli, a distant cousin who lives in West Haven and provided a valuable credential in the United States approval process: a family tie. Mr. Atohmashli and his relatives are clients of Integrated Refugee &amp; Immigrant Services, or Iris, an agency that resettles refugees in Connecticut and collaborates with the community and religious groups to get newcomers set up. A State Department website describes the process: ""U.S. Security screening of all refugees involves multiple U.S. agencies, including the Departments of State, Homeland...",1863330710,Newspapers," Dwyer, Jim

Travelers Unable to Enter the U.S. Are Left Stranded Abroad,"The largely spontaneous and spirited protests at American airports over the weekend focused on several aspects of Mr. Trump's order, including a 120-day ban on all refugees, an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and an attempt -- later blocked by judges -- to deport people with valid visas or refugee status who had already arrived in the United States. [...]many travelers were stuck in various states of limbo abroad -- far from the sightlines of American protesters -- and their plight has only slowly come to light, in many cases through the efforts of volunteer lawyers who have been working on their cases. A 38-year-old Syrian man said that he had been blocked from flying from Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, to the United States, where he had a research position lined up at a university in North Dakota. In an email to The New York Times, he shared a copy of his United States visa -- the word CANCELED was written over it -- but asked that his name not be used because he did not want to jeopardize his residency status in the United Arab Emirates.

A Threat to Home,"Permanent green-card holders are more secure than provisional ones; political asylum or refugee status can be canceled with the stroke of a pen; asylum applicants are the most vulnerable -- thousands of people are in the country legally, awaiting an interview or a decision on their application, but their right to remain here can be snatched away for any reason. For Martina, freedom of speech also figured strongly in the imagined freedom of the United States. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, which had deported dozens of people a year in the 1950s and 1960s, had stopped actively hunting down homosexuals, but an openly gay or bisexual person could still not be granted citizenship. [...]in 1993, she spoke at a gay and lesbian march on Washington. [...]this was the promise that had brought us here: not that we would find home immediately but that we would have the freedom to make our home here.

THE WORLD; Feeling like 'the worst scum'; Trump's specific rejection crushes the hopes of many Syrian refugees,"Like so many Syrian refugees who have clustered together in this northern Lebanese port, where an abandoned, weed-strewn train station stands as a metaphor for dashed dreams, Abu Moussa is feeling the frustration of exile. For most people here, Trump's indefinite ban on the resettlement of Syrian nationals in America (as opposed to an injunction of at least four months on six other Muslim-majority countries) was further proof that the world has all but abandoned the refugees fleeing civil war. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians, desperate to flee the violence of the six-year civil war ravaging their country, have opted for a risky sea passage between Turkey and Greece en route to refugee-friendly European countries such as Germany and Sweden. Lebanon, whose population before the Syrian civil war was 4.3 million according to the World Bank, has taken in 1.1 million registered refugees -- with an estimated 400,000 more off the books -- a whopping 37% increase in its overall population. In a meeting with U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi in the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Monday, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem ""reiterated the Syrian government's call for the Syrian refugees in the neighboring countries to return to...",1863513739,Newspapers," Bulos, Nabih

High-tech worries in India; U.S. visa program that has represented a path to the middle class for thousands may be under threat.,"Two California members of Congress, Darrell Issa (R-Vista) and Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose), have introduced legislation aimed at raising the salaries of H-1B visa holders from the minimum of $60,000, aiming to make it harder for foreign workers to undercut Americans. In the Senate, Illinois Democrat Richard J. Durbin and Iowa Republican Charles E. Grassley are planning a bill that would end the computerized lottery system for H-1B visas -- which Indian companies flood with applications -- and require employers seeking the visas to demonstrate they attempted to hire Americans first. Indian corporate leaders also point to Trump's nominee for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who as a senator was one of the visa program's toughest critics. Shivendra Singh, vice president of global trade development at Nasscom, an Indian industry group, said previous efforts by Congress to shrink the visa program, such as by raising fees, have not reduced the number...",1863578532,Newspapers," Bengali, Shashank

"THE WORLD; Trump's shadow over Europe; The U.S. has joined Russia and China as a threat to the continent, council president writes.","Tusk, who heads the council that defines EU priorities, said the external threat posed by the U.S. administration was among geopolitical conditions that include an assertive China, especially on the seas, Russian aggression toward Ukraine and its neighbors, and anarchy in the Middle East and Africa, with radical Islam playing a major role. The Tusk letter came a day after former Belgium Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief negotiator as Britain prepares to leave the EU, said during a speech at a London think tank Monday that he believes Trump is trying to encourage exit referendums in Germany and France. In Britain, where 48% of voters favored remaining part of the European Union while 52% voted to leave in the bitterly fought referendum campaign, and more than 100,000 people recently took to the streets in a series of anti-Trump women's marches, tension has also been running high.

THE NATION; Turmoil at Justice Department; Sally Yates' defiance of Trump's order elicits praise and criticism from her former colleagues.,"[...]other lawyers, including former Obama administration appointees and current Justice Department officials, questioned her order's legal underpinnings and described it as a gesture designed to allow her to leave office on a high note. Yates and Lynch had been criticized by Democrats and former Justice Department officials for not halting FBI Director James B. Comey in October from issuing a letter to Congress announcing that his agents were reviewing new emails potentially related to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of State. Jack Goldsmith, a respected former top Justice Department official who resigned his post in 2004 after sparring with the George W. Bush White House about the legality of torture and other matters, wrote in a blog that Yates' justification for not defending the executive order was ""extraordinarily weak.""

Some travel bans could stay put,"Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen -- many ""are in various states of collapse,"" Kelly said, and have poor record-keeping or unreliable police forces that undermine U.S. border officials' efforts to determine travelers' identities and criminal histories.Customs and Border Protection, the agency that runs hundreds of immigration checkpoints at the country's airports and ports of entry, did not prepare instructions for border officials in advance of the order being signed Friday evening.White House officials understood that they risk their relationships with Republican lawmakers over how the order was executed, said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.[...]they maintained that all court orders were followed, rebutted reports that some legal residents were denied access to attorneys at airports and said everyone detained by border agents was treated with ""dignity and respect.""White House officials have asserted that the ban has wide support, but a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Monday and Tuesday found that 49% of Americans said they either ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" agreed with Trump's order, and 41% ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" disagreed, with the divide split along party lines.",1863668634,Newspapers," Bennett, Brian

Trump's executive order -- which blocks nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days -- is facing numerous lawsuits from civil rights groups who contend that it discriminates against Muslims, violates another provision of immigration law by targeting certain nationalities and denies due process to people who already have been vetted to enter the U.S. There are also questions about whether the order, which also keeps out refugees from around the world for 120 days and those from Syria indefinitely, actually serves its stated purpose of national security.

"Trump Effect is in full swing, and no one is immune","The abrupt firing of acting attorney general Sally Q. Yates, after she announced that the Justice Department would not defend the administration's immigration ban in court, crystallized all that had occurred since Trump took the oath on Jan. 20. Trump's administration, which at this point is not much more than an overworked and beleaguered White House staff aided by a few confirmed Cabinet officials, has moved swiftly to implement in some fashion his campaign promises. When asked about that Monday at his daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that, if they have a problem with the policy, ""They should either get with the program or they can go."" Other signs of the resistance include the decision by various mayors to ignore Trump's vow to end federal assistance to cities that protect undocumented immigrants and that the American Civil Liberties Union raised $24 million over the weekend, which is six times the amount it normally raises online in a full year. The president, responding to attacks, has taken to Twitter or in public words to belittle Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.).",1863711477,Newspapers," Balz, Dan

Breyer depart, giving conservatives, including the court's conservatives, an opportunity to overturn the abortion right and other liberal precedents.In 2013, the 10th Circuit, including Gorsuch, ruled in favor of the Green family, owners of the Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores, who sought a religious exemption from paying for drugs or devices that they believed could destroy a fertilized human egg.A year later, the Supreme Court came to the same conclusion in a 5-4 decision. -- david.savage@latimes.com -- (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX) Neil M.

Kelly said at a news conference Tuesday that department officials ""are and will remain in compliance with judicial orders,"" though attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union said they were not fully convinced that was the case.Senior Homeland Security officials on Tuesday sought to quell concerns about travelers being denied entry in violation of court orders, holding a news conference to discuss the details with reporters.Acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Kevin McAleenan said that in the past 72 hours, 721 people with visas from the seven countries listed on the executive order had been denied permission at foreign airports to board flights headed to the United States, and asserted, ""There were carriers that overinterpreted our guidance.""",1863720693,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

San Francisco sues Trump; Lawsuit challenges order targeting 'sanctuary cities' [Corrected 02/04/17],"[...]New York is challenging a different Trump executive order on immigration -- one temporarily blocking people from seven Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the United States.The filing in federal court comes less than a week after President Trump issued orders putting cities and counties on notice that they would lose federal funding if they did not start cooperating with immigration agents.San Francisco's sanctuary law prohibits local law enforcement officers from cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention requests and limits when the officers may notify the federal agency of a person's release from jail.UC Irvine Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor, said the Supreme Court has interpreted that the Constitution prevents the federal government from commandeering state and local governments to administer a federal law.In 1997, the conservative majority on the high court ruled that the federal government could not force states to do background checks prior to gun sales.The law declared that local authorities could not keep immigrants in custody to be handed over to federal immigration officials if they had no violent felonies on their records and did not face charges.",1863755482,Newspapers," Dolan, Maura

After the war, he was one of the early hires of what became U.S. News &amp; World Report. Eventually, he became a correspondent for Westinghouse, and his coverage of the peace talks to end the Vietnam War won the 1968 Overseas Press Club award for best radio reporting from abroad. The next year, he received a master's degree from Columbia University's journalism school and was awarded a Pulitzer traveling scholarship that eventually took him to Mexico.

Lawsuits in Chicago challenge travel ban,"The first lawsuits in Chicago over President Donald Trump's controversial executive order on immigration have been filed, including by a young doctor who traveled to the United Arab Emirates to be wed only to have his visa canceled on his attempt to return home.A Syrian citizen and legal resident of UAE, Al Homssi's travel visas were canceled by U.S. officials, a move that not only threatens Al Homssi's future as a doctor in the U.S. but also could lead to his forced return to war-torn Syria, according to his lawyer, Thomas Anthony Durkin.According to the suit, the man was planning to return to Chicago early this month in time for the birth of his first grandchild, but when he tried to get a return flight Saturday, the ticketing agency ""refused to issue a ticket for his travel to the United States due to the executive order.""Doe's lawyer, Taher Kameli, said Tuesday that his client is ""anxious"" to get home to see his family but afraid to try to re-enter the U.S. with reports of immigration agents detaining travelers for hours of questioning even if they have permanent residency or green cards.",1863759357,Newspapers," Meisner, Jason

Trump picks Gorsuch,"President Donald Trump nominated federal Judge Neil Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia, choosing a Western appeals court judge seen as the most likely choice from Trump's shortlist to win Senate confirmation. Because Scalia was a stalwart conservative, Gorsuch is not likely to change the balance of the court. Trump made his announcement with trademark showmanship, on the grand stage of the White House's East Room before a national audience, creating an aura of mystery -- or in the more critical view of some, a reality-show atmosphere -- around what is traditionally a staid, sober process. Liberal activists have already begun to take aim at Democrats who voted to advance some of Trump's Cabinet nominees and are likely to press further to try to block Gorsuch, given the consequential nature of recent Supreme Court decisions in preserving abortion rights, extending marriage rights to same-sex couples and twice upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.

[...]before federal judges issued stays of the order, detainees at Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C., included an Iranian couple in their 80s, both with green cards confirming their status as legal permanent residents of this country, according to news reports.

Six questions about court cases filed after Trump's immigration order,"On Saturday night, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn barred the removal of all refugees previously approved to enter, visa holders and permanent U.S. residents who were detained or barred under the executive order.In Boston, U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs issued a seven-day restraining order that prohibits federal officials from deporting and detaining immigrants and refugees from the seven countries who have valid visas.U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema in the Eastern District of Virginia also issued a seven-day restraining order that applies to legal permanent residents from those same nations who were being held at Dulles International Airport.U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles directed homeland security officials to return Iranian native Ali Khoshbakhti Vayeghan to the United States after U.S. authorities had sent him back to Iran.The court battle is moving into a second, nonemergency phase, as immigrant advocates and civil liberties groups begin weighing challenges not just on behalf of those stopped at airport entry points, but also on behalf of different groups of individuals and businesses inside and outside the United States who could be affected longer term. ann.marimow@washpost.com spencer.hsu@washpost.com Ellen Nakashima and Mark Berman contributed to this report.",1863781392,Newspapers," Marimow, Ann E

Va. joins suit against Trump ban on travelers,"Airport detentions led to violation of residents' rights, Herring says The Commonwealth of Virginia intervened Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by attorneys for two Yemeni brothers who arrived at Dulles International Airport on Saturday and were quickly put on a return flight to Ethiopia in response to President Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries.At a news conference Tuesday, Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) called Trump's executive order ""sweeping, poorly understood and chaotically implemented,"" and said it ""led to the violation of the constitutional and statutory rights of numerous residents of Virginia.""[...]he said, the state would face difficulty in attracting students and faculty, and would suffer financial damage.On Saturday night, U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema issued an order guaranteeing access to attorneys for all legal permanent residents detained at Dulles and barring the removal of those residents for seven days.",1863783062,Newspapers," Weiner, Rachel

"Trump, Giuliani TV interviews informed Yates's decision","Official: Their comments put immigration orderin 'a very different light' As acting attorney general Sally Yates struggled to figure out how or whether to defend President Trump's immigration order last weekend - while protests erupted at airports nationwide, immigrants were denied entry to the United States and civil rights lawyers rushed to court - two events helped crystallize her decision. Jonathan Turley, a constitutional-law scholar at the George Washington University Law School, called Yates's letter to the department ""a mistake"" and said that President Barack Obama's Justice Department argued last year ""that a federal court should not second-guess a president on immigration decisions"" and ""defended the president's power to act unilaterally."" Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School and a former assistant attorney general who headed the Office of Legal Counsel under President George W. Bush, said that Yates should have resigned if she could not defend the president's order. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel had been asked by the White House to review Trump's executive order.",1863783851,Newspapers," Horwitz, Sari

Democrats vow to fight Trump moves,"Maryland Democratic legislative leaders are launching an effort to wage legal war on what they called President Trump's attacks on immigration, health care and civil rights, vowing to protect state residents from potential negative impacts of policies enacted by a Republican-controlled White House and Congress. Democrats said they are concerned that Republicans would use a convention to mandate conservative policies or remove protections such as abortion rights, especially with the GOP controlling the White House, both chambers of Congress, 33 governorships and the majority of state legislative chambers. The legislative package includes a resolution calling on Maryland's congressional delegation and Hogan to strongly oppose and resist a repeal of the federal Affordable Care Act, which the chair of the state Senate's budget committee said could result in the loss of $3.5 billion in federal funds. House Democrats say the measure would help combat air pollution and climate change while creating...",1863785363,Newspapers," Wiggins, Ovetta

In the past 15 years, he shifted into entertainment and conservative media, making films about Ronald Reagan and Sarah Palin and then taking a lead role at Breitbart News. At Breitbart, Bannon cemented his role as a champion of the alt-right, the anti-globalism movement that has attracted support from white supremacists and found a home on the far-right website. ""The middle class, the working men and women in the world ... are just tired of being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos,"" Bannon said in a 2014 speech to a conference at the Vatican in a recording obtained by BuzzFeed.

An Apology to Muslims,"In effect, Trump took a real problem, inflated it with hysteria, handled it with incompetence and created an unjust policy that targets seven mostly impoverished Muslim countries that haven't produced a single person involved in a lethal terrorist attack in America since before 9/11. Trump's national security adviser, Mike Flynn, has referred to Islam as a ""cancer"" and has shared a video asserting that Islam ""wants 80 percent of humanity enslaved or exterminated."" Raised by a struggling single mom, sometimes showing up at high school at 5:30 a.m. to study, he attended Cornell and won the university's outstanding student award. If we need an inspiring example of how moderates can successfully challenge extremists, consider an extraordinary Somali gynecologist, Dr. Hawa Abdi, who ran a displaced persons camp in Somalia, including a 400-bed hospital (and a jail for men who beat their wives).

U.S.-Australia Rift Possible After Call,"A phone call between President Trump and the Australian prime minister is threatening to develop into a diplomatic rift between two stalwart allies after the two men exchanged harsh words over refugee policy, and Mr. Trump abruptly ended the call. The phone call last Saturday between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull turned contentious after the Australian leader pressed the president to honor an agreement to accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. The details of the call were confirmed by a senior administration official with direct knowledge of the exchange who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the diplomatic talks. On Wednesday night, the senior Trump administration official said the president's comments to Peña Nieto were made in jest and the comments reflected Mr. Trump's standing offer to help Mexico battle drug gangs and control boarder crossings.",1863551877,Newspapers," Thrush, Glenn

Pence's Presidential Pet,"The world was a-swoon over Donald Trump's nomination to the Supreme Court. [...]he did suggest he's ""studied"" Gorsuch's work. Since the judge does not have a history of either tweeting or writing about Donald Trump, serious presidential perusal seems highly unlikely. The Democrats could filibuster, but then McConnell might try to change the rules so it would only take a simple majority to push a Supreme Court nominee through. The Gorsuch nomination is important, but there could be an even more critical one later if either Justice Anthony Kennedy or Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the court. [...]instead of the dots, I got an announcement asking me to support the American Civil Liberties Union. Trump, you'll remember, once said he thought a great Supreme Court justice would be one who would put on the robe, sit down and begin investigating Hillary Clinton's email practices.",1863551908,Newspapers," Collins, Gail

Trump's Mexican Shakedown,"In Mexico's so-called drug war, cartel gunmen have often used their violent power to demand money from innocent people. Mexico's minimum wage has just risen to about $4 per day, and 28 million Mexicans can't afford a healthy diet. In the campaign, Mr. Trump released a memo saying the United States could force Mexico to pay by blocking remittances, the nearly $25 billion sent home by Mexicans every year, money earned from hard labor that supports the poorest communities south of the border. If Congress passes a bill to fund the wall, lawmakers need to force out any wording that commits to collecting the money from Mexico.

Trump badgers leader of Australia,"[...]President Trump blasted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a refugee agreement and boasted about the magnitude of his electoral college win, according to senior U.S. officials briefed on the Saturday exchange. The characterizations provide insight into Trump's temperament and approach to the diplomatic requirements of his job as the nation's chief executive, a role in which he continues to employ both the uncompromising negotiating tactics he honed as a real estate developer and the bombastic style he exhibited as a reality television personality. [...]Trump is also notoriously thin-skinned and has used platforms including social-media accounts, meetings with lawmakers and even a speech at CIA headquarters to depict his victory as an achievement of historic proportions, rather than a narrow outcome in which his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote. The friction with Turnbull reflected Trump's anger over being bound by an agreement reached by the Obama administration to accept refugees from Australian detention sites even while Trump was issuing an executive order suspending such arrivals from elsewhere in the world. Trump made the call to Turnbull about 5 p.m. Saturday from his desk in the Oval Office, where he was joined by chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, national security adviser Michael Flynn and White House press secretary Sean Spicer.",1863785271,Newspapers," Miller, Greg

A new era foreign policy,"Just before the Senate confirmed Trump's new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, on Wednesday, national security adviser Michael Flynn made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room to deliver a tight-lipped warning to Iran over its most recent ballistic missile test. Tillerson takes office after a chaotic first dozen days for the Trump administration that saw big swings away from national security and foreign policy policies stances in place under the Obama administration. A day later he stood beside British Prime Minister Theresa May for an event that is a staple of world leader diplomacy - the cordial and mutually congratulatory joint news conference. Gates, a Republican who recommended Tillerson to Trump as a dark-horse candidate, is among a long bipartisan list of foreign policy experts who have argued that actions appearing to target Muslims play into the hands of extremists who claim that the United States is at war with Islam. Trump is breaking with the practices of both Republican and Democratic administrations by including a political adviser, Bannon, in National Security Council meetings with Cabinet officials. A European diplomat who recently met with Trump aides and pressed for cooperation at the United Nations and elsewhere to promote peace in the Middle East recounted a startling exchange with Jason D. Greenblatt, then Trump's in-house lawyer and now his chief of international negotiations.",1863785477,Newspapers," Gearan, Anne

"UNEASY OVER TRUMP EDICT; Feelings are mixed in San Bernardino, where attack helped fuel the travel ban","Rep. Pete Aguilar, a Democrat whose congressional district includes San Bernardino, has strongly denounced the ban and Trump's repeated mention of the terrorist attack as a motivation for it.Since the order was announced, there have been mixed signals about whether it would apply to green-card holders, lawful permanent residents.On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said he deemed ""the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.""Houser also said he was angered that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, where the San Bernardino attackers had ties, were not on the list of countries affected by the travel ban.The executive order issued Friday suspends new refugee entries into the United States for 120 days and restricts for 90 days immigration from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.Amanios, a finance student at the University of San Francisco, was a toddler when she and her father came to the U.S. from Eritrea on travel visas in 2000 to attend her mother's graduation from nursing school.Robert Gauthier Los Angeles Times; PHOTO: ""I DON'T know why he has rushed so quickly to implement this policy,"" said Hal Houser, a Trump supporter who saw the San Bernardino attack, of the travel ban.; PHOTOGRAPHER:",1863796001,Newspapers," Parvini, Sarah

Arab American Republicans are divided over entry ban,"Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) was born in the United States, the son of a Palestinian refugee father and a Syrian immigrant mother. Amash is one of six lawmakers of Arab descent suddenly thrust into the spotlight thanks to a heated national debate over Trump's executive order banning entry into the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from around the world. The split points to a deepening division between GOP partisans eager to applaud Trump's actions and others who are debating whether and how to resist in the early days of the administration, when dissent could risk a public rebuke from the president. Trump's order prompted chaos at U.S. airports, sparked widespread protests and drew a swift wave of legal challenges, plunging the administration into chaos after only one full week in office. LaHood, son of former GOP congressman and secretary of transportation Ray LaHood, said the travel ban ""should be viewed as protecting our homeland and its citizens. "" ""The United States will continue to be a beacon of hope and opportunity for those looking to immigrate to a better way of life, but first and foremost, national security for our American citizens and our homeland...",1863813809,Newspapers," Viebeck, Elise

A fraught journey to safety,"The answer for the Tenleytown church, whose more than 3,500 members include many government employees and former employees, was to resettle a family seeking refuge from a war-torn corner of the world. ""The situation remains in flux and is completely unpredictable,"" said an email from Sunday school teacher Joanne Lin that was sent to church families Thursday, after news organizations began reporting that travelers with refugee visas, as well as citizens from certain majority-Muslim countries, might not be let into the United States. Refugees from Afghanistan and elsewhere were detained at immigration stations or barred from boarding U.S.-bound flights starting Saturday, and lawyers and protesters flooded major U.S. airports, including Dulles International, where the family sponsored by St. Columba's was expected in just three days. Jim Losey, co-chair of the committee, repeated something he'd been told by Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, which resettled 1,040 refugees in the area in 2016, and had connected this family with the church: ""Don't believe they're here safely until they've cleared customs and are in your car. At Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown, more than 50 volunteers have gathered furniture, food and clothes for a family of eight Syrians. On Tuesday morning, a parishioner dropped off a portable stroller and a car seat, to be installed in Losey's car, as well as disposable diapers, baby wipes and a couple of changes of toddler-size clothing. Wajid, who said he was resettled by a Virginia chapter of Lutheran Social Services, had rented...",1863821487,Newspapers," Sullivan, Patricia

"U.S., Mexico appear to take steps to renegotiate NAFTA","The United States and Mexico appear to have taken the first steps toward renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to a Mexican government document, walking down a path that would fulfill one of President Trump's big campaign promises and potentially transform the hemisphere's economy. If the White House is indeed proceeding under fast-track authority, that suggests Trump could intend to scrap NAFTA altogether and forge bilateral trade deals with Mexico and Canada instead, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Renegotiating NAFTA was one of the major promises Trump made on the campaign trail, where he criticized the trade pact, which took effect in 1994, for hollowing America's manufacturing sector. Mexican officials plan to use the 90-day consultation period to meet with domestic industry leaders in farming, manufacturing, textiles, petroleum and other sectors, to see which aspects of NAFTA could be improved.",1863822796,Newspapers," Swanson, Ana

Ruling adds to rebukes of ban,"Using sweeping, unambiguous language, U.S. District Judge Andre Birotte Jr. on Tuesday night granted a temporary restraining order against the executive order Trump signed late last week.The wording would seem to mean that government officials would not be allowed to continue the practice of instructing airlines and border officials in other countries to stop immigrants from the affected countries from boarding planes bound for the U.S. The judge's language also seemed to pose a direct challenge to a decision by a U.S. State Department official on Friday to provisionally revoke valid immigration visas granted to people from countries named in the executive order.Newly sworn-in Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said earlier this week that the restrictions target some countries that ""are in various states of collapse"" and have poor record-keeping or unreliable police forces that undermine U.S. border officials' efforts to determine travelers' identities and criminal histories.According to O'Farrell's office, the Los Angeles metro area has about 161,000 residents born in the countries listed in the travel ban, by far the highest number in the nation.",1863827697,Newspapers," Rubin, Joel

"Tillerson takes over an agency in tumult; Confirmed in a mostly party-line vote, he assumes the reins of a State Department roiled by mass dissent.","Newly confirmed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's most urgent task at the State Department isn't necessarily to manage the threat from Iran and North Korea, to recast relations with Russia and China, or to calm nervous allies in Europe and the Far East. Trump's critics describe confusion and concern at the State Department as career diplomats and civil servants struggle with what they see as worrying overtures to Russia and seeming snubs of NATO allies, as well as an early dispute with Mexico and an executive order temporarily barring entry to visitors and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. Selecting replacements for those positions may put the former Texas oil man at odds with the White House, which already has taken heat for sweeping executive orders that government agencies say were issued without input from them. During a rocky Senate confirmation hearing last month, he faced sharp questions from Democrats about his personal friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his refusal to condemn Saudi Arabia and the Philippines for human rights abuses, and his views on efforts to ease global warming. The dissent channel is a rarely used but time-honored system that allows State Department officials to offer signed opinions on...",1863833364,Newspapers," Wilkinson, Tracy

"CAPITOL JOURNAL; Yes, fight Trump -- but carefully","[...]it has been pretty good politics so far. Should they be focusing their energies on defending immigrants and fighting the new Republican president rather than concentrating on such acute state problems as crumbling highways and short water supplies? I asked a veteran Democratic campaign strategist who advises moderate legislators. Michael S. Dukakis was the governor, a fact voters were reminded of by George H.W. Bush in an odorous TV ad when the two ran for president in 1988. The sanctuary bill, by De Leon, would prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from using their officers or jails to uphold federal immigration laws. ""If President Trump moves forward forcefully with the massive deportation of working families -- law-abiding residents who pay their taxes, contribute greatly to our richness -- the state of California will not participate in any way, shape or form,"" De Leon told me.

"Trump trip to Wis. canceled amid protest plans, reports say","President meets with Harley-Davidson leaders at the White House Five Harley-Davidson motorcycles rolled onto the White House's South Lawn Thursday afternoon, where they were greeted by President Trump. The group organized a call-in campaign, urging activists to flood Harley-Davidson and chief executive Matt Levatich with messages, emails and phone calls condemning the Trump appearance. During a White House briefing Wednesday, press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that the trip was never set in stone and suggested that the planned protest had no bearing on whether Trump would make the appearance. Secret Service members had cleared rooms in a Hilton hotel in Milwaukee, and agents had toured the Menomonee Falls plant, said a hotel worker and two factory employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because their employers had not authorized them to talk to the media.

Visa Ban Is Amended to Allow Iraqi Interpreters Into U.S.,"The change, recommended by the Pentagon, eased some of the anger generated in Iraq by President Trump's executive order imposing the ban, which has stoked anxiety and confusion around much of the world since it was issued last week. Even with valid visas in hand, some were refused entry at American airports and others were removed from planes scheduled to fly to the United States. The Pentagon recommended that the White House exempt from the travel ban Special Immigrant Visa holders and others who had demonstrated their commitment to American military forces. Munther A. said his family had been forced to find emergency housing with friends in Baghdad. Since 2007, the State Department has issued more than 1,700 Special Immigrant Visas to Iraqi interpreters and their family members. Many had received refugee visas to resettle in the United States with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration, but they were blocked by the travel ban this week. A 33-year-old Iraqi father of two who worked seven years for a contractor that supplied American troops said he and his family had been granted visas for relocation to Charlotte, N.C., after passing extensive security checks.",1864052613,Newspapers," Zucchino, David

Putin Swaggers Into Hungary as Europe Wonders About the U.S.,"When President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last paid a visit to Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban was under siege for his autocratic style, Russia was isolated for its seizure of Crimea, and both men were called xenophobes for their hard-line stance on immigration. Many here, skeptical that the Americans and Russians will actually bridge the chasm of interests dividing them, are injecting a note of caution about the balancing act ahead for leaders like Mr. Orban and his governing right-wing party, Fidesz. Andras Racz, a Russia expert and associate professor at Pazmany Peter Catholic University in Budapest, predicted that the reset in relations between the United States and Russia would result in ""a brief honeymoon, but nothing else, soon overwritten by conflicting interests."" [...]Zoltan Kovacs, Viktor Orban's spokesman, said in an interview that both nations would treat Mr. Putin's visit as ""business as usual,"" with energy policy and a Russian deal to build a nuclear power plant in Hungary at the top of the agenda. Efforts are underway to arrange a meeting with Mr. Trump -- the timing and location are still under discussion -- and Mr. Orban is also planning a visit to Beijing and a meeting with...",1864052741,Newspapers," Lyman, Rick

""The Shabab will be suspicious of us,"" said Deck Abdi Korriyow, another refugee, referring to the militant group that has slaughtered thousands of people across eastern Africa. Refugee officials said the Shabab fears could be real, but that some refugees also played up such concerns in an attempt to delay or stop their return to the camps, which can be depressing on a good day. For more than a quarter-century, the brothers had been living together in a small makeshift house in a refugee camp, usually jobless and surviving off the monthly United Nations rations, which they said had been cut down to seven pounds of grain, one cup of oil and a bottle capful of salt.

"For Europe, There's a New Threat in Town: The U.S.","A European official, Donald Tusk, created a stir this week when he wrote a letter to 27 leaders of the bloc's 28 member states suggesting that the Trump administration presented a threat on a par with a newly assertive China, an aggressive Russia and ""wars, terror and anarchy in the Middle East and Africa."" Intentionally, he left out Britain, because it has voted to leave the bloc and its prime minister, Theresa May, has rushed with what some Europeans consider unseemly rapidity to the side of Mr. Trump, who has derided the European Union and praised Britain's withdrawal, or ""Brexit,"" saying, ""I don't think it matters much for the United States."" In his letter, Mr. Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who is the president of the European Council, made up of the national leaders, wrote of ""worrying declarations"" from the Trump team, adding: ""Particularly the change in Washington puts the European Union in a difficult situation, with the new administration seeming to put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy."" There have been other moments when Europeans judged American policies as harmful, including the Iraq war and the assaults on multilateralism early in the first term of President George W. Bush. Another result, said François Heisbourg, a senior adviser with the French Foundation for Strategic Research, may be a more serious European effort at forming its own defense capacity, which may not be in the interests of NATO or the United States.

"In Austin, salvos in the 'sanctuary city' battle","While thousands of protesters gather nationwide to decry Trump's temporary travel ban on refugees and on citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations, Rigby and other activists in cities with large immigrant populations are bracing for what they fear will come next: a wave of raids and deportations. In one of his first acts as president, Trump ordered the Department of Homeland Security to look at withholding federal funding from cities that refuse to assist immigration officials, a loose collection of municipalities known as ""sanctuary cities."" If DHS finds someone who is undocumented, and that person is charged with murder, sexual assault or human smuggling, Hernandez says she will comply with federal requests to hold the person for 48 hours so they can be taken into custody by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, and ultimately deported. Federal courts have repeatedly concluded that local jailers have no legal obligation to comply with ICE detainers. [...]courts have said that holding someone without a warrant could violate their constitutional rights, putting jailers at risk of lawsuits. Said Rachel Rosenbloom, a professor of immigration law and policy at Northeastern University: ""Cities are definitely emerging as the protectors of immigrants."" Since Trump's election in November, she said, ""there have been a number of cities that have really doubled down on their support for immigrants."" [...]they're planning mass acts of civil disobedience, soliciting churches to shelter undocumented immigrants, developing neighborhood warning systems so people know to hide when ICE comes through and training volunteers as...",1864059071,Newspapers," Hauslohner, Abigail

Tech firms' opposition to immigration policies rises,"SAN FRANCISCO - SAN FRANCISCO - The tech industry's opposition to President Trump escalated Thursday as corporate leaders drafted a letter warning of the economic risks of his immigration policies, Uber's chief executive quit an administration advisory board and Lyft pulled its ads from Breitbart News, the site founded by the White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. Sam Altman, the president of Silicon Valley's Y Combinator, called the reaction to the immigration ban a watershed moment in which the tech industry - rivals and all - made the unusual move of coming together and drawing a line in the sand against a sitting president. The steps taken by tech companies become more urgent after a draft of what appeared to be a Trump administration executive order limiting workers on H-1B visas circulated widely in Silicon Valley this week. [...]White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters this week that the administration expects to scrutinize work visa programs closely as part of its immigration agenda. In separate letter, more than 115 Silicon Valley start-up founders and venture capitalists pleaded with the administration to cancel the immigration ban.",1864059086,Newspapers," Dwoskin, Elizabeth

"Wary of Rhetoric, Groups Turn Down U.S. Aid to Fight Extremism","Last month, the Department of Homeland Security, under the Obama administration, awarded $10 million in grants to more than two dozen community groups and cities for programs to counter recruitment efforts by terrorist and white supremacist groups. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment, though people briefed on the matter said there was fierce resistance inside the department to making changes to the program that could further alienate Muslim communities assisting antiterrorism efforts. Erroll G. Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California, said a singular focus on Muslim extremism would offer only a partial picture of violence in the United States. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of killings in the United States by white supremacists, antigovernment fanatics and other homegrown extremists has been comparable to that of Islamic terrorists. The federal programs have prompted a heated debate among Muslim scholars and activists, with civil rights groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations saying they stigmatize entire communities. Faiza Patel, a co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said the proposed change to the Countering Violent...",1864059153,Newspapers," Nixon, Ron

Travel Order's Policies Create Visa Confusion for Immigrants in U.S.,"Much of the criticism of the executive order signed by President Trump has focused on foreigners prevented from entering the country, but a court filing in the legal battle over the travel ban reveals a far broader impact, imperiling the residency status of tens of thousands of immigrants everyone from asylum seekers to students and technology workers already living in the United States. In addition to reviewing how the Department of Homeland Security carried out the executive order, the inspector general's office said it would review the agency's adherence to court orders and allegations of individual misconduct. Some immigration lawyers said they feared that the State Department's cancellation of visas could expose immigrants and other legal foreign residents to deportation, but officials at the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security said those in the United States were not affected. Unlike the refugee ban, which was announced with much fanfare, the canceled visas came to light only as a result of court filings by government lawyers defending the ban on travelers from the seven countries against litigation. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that legal permanent residents from the seven countries, also known as green card holders, would be able to enter the United States without getting special waivers. ""Basically, they are trapped without some other measures they would have to take, another application process they would have to go through,"" said Doris Meissner, senior fellow and director of the United States immigration...",1864059364,Newspapers," Kulish, Nicholas

Looking to the heavens for answers about Trump,"Normally, customers coming to Shastri's tiny office - a fading sign over the door reads ""Astrological Council &amp; Research Institute"" - give a handful of rupees in exchange for his help predicting auspicious times for marriage, charting a career path or healing a broken heart.

To achieve his best, the astrologer recommends that the new president wear a 6.25-carat ruby ring and keep a self-portrait in a wooden frame facing south in the Oval Office.

Trump Reverts to Pillars of Obama Policies Abroad,"President Trump, after promising a radical break with the foreign policy of Barack Obama, is embracing some key pillars of the former administration's strategy, including warning Israel to curb settlement construction, demanding that Russia withdraw from Crimea and threatening Iran with sanctions for ballistic missile tests. In the most startling shift, the White House issued an unexpected statement appealing to the Israeli government not to expand the construction of Jewish settlements beyond their current borders in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The White House has also shown no indication that it plans to rip up Mr. Obama's landmark nuclear deal, despite Mr. Trump's withering criticism of it during the presidential campaign. [...]Mr. Trump presented himself during the campaign as a stalwart supporter of Israel and criticized the Obama administration for allowing the passage of a Security Council resolution in December that condemned Israel for its expansion of settlements. Mr. Trump shifted his policy after he met briefly with King Abdullah II of Jordan on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast -- an encounter that put the king, one of the most respected leaders of the Arab world, ahead of Mr. Netanyahu in seeing the new president. The ""beyond their current borders"" phrase in the White House statement hinted at a return to a policy President George W. Bush outlined to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004, which acknowledged that it was unrealistic to expect Israel to give up its major settlements in a final deal, although they would...",1864062394,Newspapers," Landler, Mark

"U.S. coach, team oppose Trump's ban","Bruce Arena, who just began his second tenure in charge of the U.S. men's national soccer team, became the latest high-profile coach to criticize President Trump's executive order temporarily barring refugees and others seeking U.S. entry from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Arena's comments come after NBA coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich had spoken out against the White House decisions. In his second U.S. stint, which began in December, he will attempt to resurrect the American team's hopes of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia after a pair of defeats under his predecessor, Jurgen Klinsmann. The executive orders have been a topic of discussion among the more than two dozen U.S. players who have been together the past three weeks for the program's annual winter training camp. The Americans will close their winter camp Friday against Jamaica at Chattanooga's Finley Stadium, the final test before World Cup qualifying...",1864064090,Newspapers," Goff, Steven

"Trump's early foreign policy rattles allies and foes alike; 'Don't worry,' he says, but longtime strategic ties could be at risk.","Before the sun was even up on Thursday in Washington, Trump was tweeting about Iran, warning in all-capital letters that he was putting the country ""ON NOTICE"" for carrying out a medium-range ballistic missile test and attacks by proxy forces on a Saudi frigate. Mattis, meanwhile, held his first meeting with a foreign head of government, South Korea's prime minister and acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, promising to continue a united effort to confront North Korea, whose nuclear ambitions threaten the region. Ali Akbar Velayati, senior advisor to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a former foreign minister, was quoted by the Tasnim news agency using his own tough talk. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that Iran has had a ""common thread of malign influence"" in the world, listing its ongoing support for Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, Houthi rebels in Yemen and Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces in their fight against rebels, some of which the U.S. supports. Davis said the Iranian missile that was launched Sunday, which flew southward 650 miles before exploding and failing, violated a United Nations Security Council resolution. U.S. military commanders are considering whether to send an additional warship to join the two other American military vessels operating near the narrow waterway between Yemen and the Horn of Africa, where millions of barrels of oil pass through daily on ships bound for Europe, Asia and the U.S. Experts predicted contradictions will abound in Trump's unorthodox attempts to make foreign policy, including frequent Twitter...",1864064660,Newspapers," Bierman, Noah

A moving goal post; Trump era poses a challenge for Super Bowl ads,"Super Bowl Sunday traditionally has been a day for Americans to come together in a celebration of friends, football and big-ticket TV commercials. ""If you are not creating something that transcends the 50 other ads in the Super Bowl, then you are wasting your money,"" said Jason Sperling, executive creative director of the Santa Monica ad agency RPA, which designs ads for American Honda Motor Co. Advertisers, he said, try to read the national mood so commercials feel topical. Concepts for this year's Super Bowl typically were approved last summer -- when most political observers predicted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was about to become the first female president. The Arlington, Va.- company helped the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign reach disaffected Democrats in Rust Belt states. Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser commercial, titled ""Born the Hard Way,"" was meant ""to highlight the ambition of our founder, Adolphus Busch, and his unrelenting pursuit of the American dream,"" said Marcel Marcondes, vice president of marketing, in a statement. In its commercial for the Honda CR-V, ad agency RPA used computer generation to bring to life old-school yearbook photos of real-life celebrities, including basketball great Magic Johnson, actor Steve Carell and ABC's late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel, who clutches a clarinet in his school photo. Figuring out the best approach often comes down to ""the use of humor -- or an emotional pull,"" said David Angelo, chairman of the El Segundo agency David &amp; Goliath, which does work for Kia, the South Korean automaker....",1864088967,Newspapers," James, Meg

"'I can see the fear'; A blend of cultures, L.A. sees a different world under Trump","Whether or not Angelenos regularly socialize with people of different ethnic backgrounds, they interact with other cultures constantly. Because Southern California brims with immigrants who bring along their native foods, art, music and customs, most residents have a deeper experience of ""all forms of difference,"" says Don Waldie, a Lakewood-based author who has devoted much of his life to thinking about and explaining Los Angeles. A couple of blocks away, at the Black Tie Affair tattoo parlor, Arlene Escalante, 29, waits for the numbing cream to kick in in her arm before she gets inked. Escalante says her Mexican-born parents have green cards but canceled a trip to visit their family in Jalisco because they feared they might not be let back into the U.S. ""We donate clothes in Tijuana. Niles Resch, 28, an apprenticed tattoo artist, agrees. In East Hollywood, at Kaiser Permanente, David Earl Waterman, 52, is enjoying his lunch break at a cafe where employees have placed stars on a giant world map to point out their places of origin. Yet he won the electoral college vote and the election -- a fact that Waterman thinks could owe, in part, to the relative lack of ethnic diversity in some of the places where he did well. Even in Los Angeles County, however, some note that there's another fear driving Trump's immigration policies, and that concern about a surge of immigrants from parts of the Middle East is not without some basis in international, if not domestic, events....",1864348333,Newspapers," Mozingo, Joe

Trump's Aussie call 'the worst ... by far',"[...]President Donald Trump blasted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a refugee agreement and boasted about the magnitude of his Electoral College win, according to senior U.S. officials briefed on the exchange last week.At one point Trump informed Turnbull that he had spoken with four other world leaders that day, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that, ""This was the worst call by far.""[...]Trump has used platforms including social-media accounts, meetings with lawmakers and a speech at CIA headquarters to depict his victory as an achievement of historic proportions, rather than a narrow outcome in which his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote.The friction with Turnbull reflected Trump's anger over being bound by an agreement reached by former President Barack Obama's administration to accept refugees from Australian detention sites even while Trump was issuing an executive order suspending such arrivals from elsewhere in the world.Trump made the call to Turnbull from the Oval Office, where he was joined by chief strategist Stephen Bannon, national security adviser Michael Flynn and White House press secretary Sean Spicer.",1864610513,Newspapers," Miller, Greg

NEWS BRIEFING,"Unsealed records shed light on S.C. church killer's mental state CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Documents unsealed in federal court reveal new details about the mental health of convicted Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof, including a psychiatrist's finding that his disorders make it hard for him to focus, interact with others or express emotion. Quoting from a psychiatrist's testimony during one of those hearings, his lawyers wrote ""the defendant suffers from 'Social Anxiety Disorder, a Mixed Substance Abuse Disorder, a Schizoid Personality Disorder, depression by history, and a possible Autistic Spectrum Disorder.""' Some of the other trademarks of those disorders, according to the filings, are anxiety about unknown outcomes, a tendency to become overwhelmed and trouble retaining information. [...]Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu said the government would not repeal the decree, deepening the political crisis.

Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that Iran has had a ""common thread of malign influence"" in the world, listing Tehran's continuing support for Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, Houthi rebels in Yemen and support of Syrian President Bashar Assad against U.S.-backed rebels.",1864953430,Newspapers," Bierman, Noah

Immigration Order Complicates U.S. Companies' Plans in Middle East,"Top American energy, military and industrial companies have helped rebuild parts of Iraq since the war there began in 2003, and Iraqi leaders are irritated that their country, which is working closely with the United States to battle the Islamic State, was one of seven predominantly Muslim nations included in the 90-day immigration ban imposed by the order. Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a research group financed by Boeing and other military contractors, said that given how closely Iraq was working with the Pentagon, it was hard to believe that the strain caused by Mr. Trump's immigration ban would threaten any contracts to provide Iraq with military equipment. The Trump administration has said the order is meant to keep terrorists from slipping into the United States, but it set off widespread protests over concerns that it was blocking legitimate refugees and travelers. Besides Iran and Iraq, the countries named in the ban are Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a manufacturer based in West Chester, Pa., that has supplied rigs to companies working in more than 100 countries including Iraq, said that tensions over the...",1864890483,Newspapers," Drew, Christopher

Lawyers welcome role as 'good guys',"Claire Murphy saw the call go out on Twitter last Saturday, just after hearing about lawyers flocking to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport to offer free legal aid amid reports that some arriving international travelers were being detained. Several dozen lawyers were already there, pressing for access to an estimated 50 to 60 airline passengers being detained under President Trump's new executive order temporarily banning citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. Protesters had been chanting ""Let them in!"" as Customs and Border Protection officials refused to allow lawyers into the closed-door screening area, despite a federal court order issued that evening. (At a federal court hearing Friday, Erez Reuveni, an attorney from the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation, said security at Dulles bars lawyers from anything other than telephone access to people in screening. ) ""Seeing how many lawyers were here, I thought, 'I don't want to ever hear another lawyer joke,' "" Murphy, 27, said a few days later. While the American Bar Association recommends that lawyers provide at least 50 hours of free legal aid every year and many do much more, some of those at Dulles say rarely does pro bono work feel so immediate and public, let alone have international implications. On Friday, a federal judge in Washington state temporarily blocked enforcement of the order, though the practical implications of the ruling were unclear. ""Should I be worried about anything?""

Europe's Leaders Aim to Slow Migration on Dangerous Sea Route From Africa,"European Union leaders pledged on Friday to slow the movement of African migrants crossing the Mediterranean in a desperate and often deadly bid to escape war, chaos and poverty. ""With hundreds having already lost their lives in 2017 and spring approaching, we are determined to take additional action to significantly reduce migratory flows along the Central Mediterranean route and break the business model of smugglers,"" the leaders said in a joint statement in Malta, which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union. The leaders agreed on a plan that would increase support and training for Libya's Coast Guard, and give African countries more aid to discourage the paying of smugglers to undertake the perilous maritime journey. Nonetheless, immigrant rights groups expressed concern on Friday that the latest plan would result in the warehousing of migrants in decrepit centers. [...]while the bulk of those fleeing for Europe through Turkey were Syrians escaping the persecution and sectarian violence of the civil war, those leaving through Libya are a more heterogeneous group, including many West Africans escaping privation, who may not qualify for asylum.",1864898215,Newspapers," Kanter, James

"BACK STORY; Executive orders, in context; Trump's opening flurry has drawn outrage, but is it that unusual?","Since the days of George Washington, U.S. presidents have been issuing executive orders that do not require the assent of Congress. President George W. Bush's orders included instructions to his secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a national program to enhance physical activity and participation in sports. Some notable examples: * President Lincoln's 1862 Emancipation Proclamation, which declared slaves free in rebel states during the Civil War. * President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1942 order authorizing the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. * President Truman's 1948 order to integrate the armed forces. President Obama signed nine executive orders during his first two weeks in office in 2009, including ones to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp within a year, shut down the CIA's network of secret overseas prisons and end the agency's use of interrogation techniques that critics describe as torture. In addition to the travel ban, they include instructions to begin construction of an expanded border wall with Mexico and threats to withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Bannon planned film about 'Islamic States of America',"The eight-page draft, written in 2007 during Bannon's stint as a Hollywood filmmaker, proposes a three-part movie that would trace ""the culture of intolerance"" behind sharia law, examine the ""Fifth Column"" made up of ""Islamic front groups"" and identify the American enablers paving ""the road to this unique hell on earth."" Walid Phares, a Lebanese-born Maronite Christian who has warned that jihadists are posing as civil rights advocates, and Heritage Foundation security expert James Jay Carafano, who has defended Trump's executive order. The proposal names two dozen conservative writers and terrorism experts who could serve as potential on-screen guests, including Robert Spencer, director of the Jihad Watch website, who is labeled by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-Muslim ""propagandist."" The proposal also lists other ""enablers,"" including The Post, the New York Times, NPR, ""Universities and the Left,"" the ""American Jewish Community,"" the ACLU, the CIA, the FBI, the State Department and the White House. Bannon's work on the ""Great Satan"" project came after the release of his well-received 2004 Ronald Reagan biopic, ""In the Face of Evil."" Bannon then produced political documentaries including ""Border War: The Battle Over Illegal Immigration""; ""Generation Zero,"" an examination of the global economic crisis; and ""Battle for America,"" which hammered an ""out-of-touch, arrogant, and ever-expanding central government.""",1864922316,Newspapers," Gold, Matea

Bob Warnock Los Angeles :: Those fighting Trump's executive order have blind spots when it comes to immigration. Thinking of ""danger"" in terms of crime statistics alone, for example, endangers Americans of all political leanings. With millions of Americans under-employed and out of the workforce, expanding immigration is incredibly irresponsible and shortsighted, especially given the steady erosion of the American middle class.

Candidate's tendency to stoke fear continues in presidency,"""Because poor neighborhoods can't get any worse, why not try something new? Because America is already a jihadist battleground, why not take a radical and discriminatory new direction on immigration? Because the planet is in chaos, why not entirely reorient American foreign policy toward alliances and great power rivals? ""Things, after all, can't get any worse,"" Gerson continued. Perhaps most famous was the line that most Americans can still recite from Franklin D. Roosevelt's first inaugural address, when he told a country in the depth of the Great Depression that ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."" There were also other presidents - Bill Clinton in the wake of the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City, Bush standing on the rubble of the World Trade Center in 2001 - who seemed to grow into the job as they summoned the nation to defy what it feared rather than succumb to it. [...]after the Obama administration's struggles to respond to the civil war in Syria, and the gruesome images of the Islamic State beheading American hostages, the public grew more fearful. Chris Newman, an immigrant rights advocate with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said Trump has purposely blurred the lines of various potential threats to the country, including undocumented immigrants living here, refugees from abroad and even the unfounded claims that there were as many as 5 million illegal...",1864926477,Newspapers," Tumulty, Karen

Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson cited Mushkaad's case in a suit she filed against the Trump administration that contends the executive order - which names Somalia as one of the targeted countries - is unconstitutional.

Judge halts ban on entry to U.S.,"TEMPORARY ORDER APPLIES NATIONWIDE Tens of thousands of visas already revoked A federal judge in Washington state on Friday temporarily blocked enforcement of President Trump's controversial ban on entry to the United States, and airlines planned to begin allowing passengers from banned countries to board, according to a person familiar with the matter."" ""The president's order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,"" the White House said.The federal judge's ruling, which was broader than similar ones before it, set up a high-stakes legal confrontation between the new president and the judicial branch over his temporary ban on entry by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries as well as refugees. ""The order makes it clear that all of the main provisions of the executive order cannot be enforced at this time,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project.Since it was first rolled out a week ago, Trump's travel ban has been evolving - both because of legal challenges and as a result of decisions by the administration to walk back aspects of it.",1864931826,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

"Canada's Prime Minister, Under Pressure to Take a Stand, Opts to Get Along","Mr. Trudeau promoted Chrystia Freeland, the international trade minister, to minister of foreign affairs and set one priority above all else for her: to ""maintain constructive relations with the United States."" [...]Mr. Trudeau's government resisted calls from lawyers and civil rights groups to bring in all the refugees and other non-Americans who are now shut out of the United States and also to suspend some cross-border immigration agreements. Especially jarring to Canada is the new administration's promise to revamp key components of Canada's economy, like the North American Free Trade Agreement; threats to tighten the border; and demand for drastic increases in military spending by allies. Last month Mr. Trudeau's cabinet met with Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, who heads a group of business leaders advising Mr. Trump on economic issues. [...]if Mr. Trump reopens Nafta to limit the flow of Mexican goods to the United States, Mr. Trudeau's government may have to weigh protecting its trade relationship with the United States against standing up for Mexico's free-trade status -- and implicitly its support of the principle of open commerce. Ms. Freeland noted that the government's early efforts to make contact with the Trump administration allowed it to swiftly confirm that dual citizens of Canada and countries blocked by the executive order on immigration would still be able to cross the border.

The notion must cross Tillerson's mind that Trump's inaccurate tweet is needless provocation of a friend; that simultaneously infuriating Asian and European allies may not be smart; and that his task will be a thankless one as Trump's White House coterie hatches seat-of-the-pants policy and leaves his already restive State Department to deal with weighty issues in Luxembourg and the Solomon Islands. From the pointless, counterproductive, prejudice-reeking temporary ban on immigration from seven mainly Muslim countries to a botched Navy SEAL raid on Al Qaeda in Yemen, the same traits of haste and imprudence have been apparent.

Judge Issues Interim Halt to Travel Ban,"The federal government was ""arguing that we have to protect the U.S. from individuals from these countries, and there's no support for that,"" said the judge, James Robart of Federal District Court for the Western District of Washington, an appointee of President George W. Bush, in a decision delivered from the bench. Judge Robart made clear that his order applied nationwide, citing a similar nationwide injunction from a federal district court in Texas that had blocked President Barack Obama's plan to shield some undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to legally work in the United States.

Super Bowl ads scrutinized with political lens this year,"Anheuser-Busch released its tale of co-founder Adolphus Busch coming to America -- ""I vant to brew beer"" -- just as extraordinary new Trump administration rules restricting entry into the U.S. provoked a national furor. Some advertisers court controversy. 84 Lumber, a Pennsylvania company, has won the annual rejection bowl, producing a spot with political overtones that the Fox network, which is televising the game, said it wouldn't air. In the past GoDaddy, the Web services provider, would win that game by making a deliberately risque ad, allowing it to sound off about how the cowardly network didn't dare show its cutting-edge creative genius (so come to our website to see the banned spot). [...]GoDaddy in recent years has been producing commercials that fall in the Super Bowl advertising mainstream: an attempt at humor, an attempt to tie that humor to a message about the company's product.

"Approaching with caution; CEOs on Trump's business policy forum face 'a tough choice,' an economist says.","Tesla's Elon Musk said he would use the meeting to ""offer suggestions for changes"" to Trump's controversial action, which temporarily banned all refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. Other chief executives on the panel, called the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, did not speak out -- among them Walt Disney Co.'s Robert Iger.In that case, Disney was credited with putting pressure on Gov. Nathan Deal, who eventually vetoed the bill that would have offered protections to faith-based entities that refused to provide services that they said violated their beliefs.[...]Disney also is one of the more image-conscious companies in corporate America, and is typically careful to not take positions that could offend its customer base, which, like any major enterprise, includes people of many political and ideological perspectives.Before Trump's immigration executive order, it appeared imprudent for business leaders to speak out against the president, who since his election has used social media to chastise companies including Boeing.Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, associate dean of leadership programs at the Yale School of Management, said he had spoken with ""a number"" of the attendees after the meeting, and ""to a person they were pleased with the meeting.",1864940724,Newspapers," Miller, Daniel

Judge'stay of Trump order triggers race to enter U.S.,"The decision late Friday by a federal judge to temporarily halt Trump's denial of entry to travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries had created an opening - and in a frantic race on the other side of the globe, thousands of people rushed to book flights to the United States, uncertain of how long the opportunity would last. [...]amid the euphoria and excitement, the Jalili family of Iran passed through the checkpoints at Logan and onto American soil in a heartbroken state, even though their dream to emigrate - 10 years in the making - had been revived by the federal judge. Only a small number of citizens of the seven Middle Eastern and North African countries covered in Trump's banning order arrived at U.S. airports Saturday, but attorneys representing them expected a flood in the coming days. [...]the people who are suffering are the people who desperately need to come to the U.S."" She said her group is hearing reports from travelers of inconsistencies in how airlines are complying with the judge's order; it appeared that some low-level employees of some carriers were still unaware Saturday that a stay of Trump's ban had been issued. [...]Heller urged travelers to book flights soon, given the Trump administration's impending challenge of the stay, which was issued by U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle but affects the entire nation. A number of airlines - including Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways, Air France and Lufthansa - announced that they would allow travelers from...",1864986869,Newspapers," Weintraub, Karen

Trump's facile claim that his refugee policy is similar to Obama's in 2011,"President Trump, statement on executive order, Jan. 29, 2017 The Trump White House made a number of misleading statements in justifying its executive order denying entry into the United States for travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries. The Facts The only news report that we could find that referred to a six-month ban was a 2013 ABC News article that included this line: ""As a result of the Kentucky case, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News - even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets."" The ""Kentucky case"" refers to two Iraqis in Kentucky who in May 2011 were arrested and faced federal terrorism charges after officials discovered from an informant that Waad Ramadan Alwan, before he had been granted asylum in the United States, had constructed improvised roadside bombs in Iraq. The newspaper quoted a senior official as saying the State Department's National Visa Center has been ordered to flag special visa applications for expedited action. [...]Obama's policy did not prevent all citizens of that country, including green-card holders, from traveling to the United States.",1864986946,Newspapers," Kessler, Glenn

"The last, best hopeto re-Reaganize the GOP","President Trump's election has caused many observers to bemoan Reagan's supposedly waning influence on today's Republican Party. [...]Trump's election does not represent the de-Reaganization of the Republican Party; it presents Republicans with their last, best hope to re-Reaganize it. Where Goldwater attacked Republican President Dwight Eisenhower and Vice President Richard Nixon for supporting Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, Reagan enthusiastically backed both men in their presidential campaigns. Trump's belief in building more public infrastructure could be funded by a gas tax hike just like Reagan's was. A re-Reaganized Republican Party would, like Reagan, meld this belief in limited but forceful government action with the traditional belief in the private sector.",1864986957,Newspapers," Olsen, Henry

Trump's very brief crusade to lower drug prices,"Amid all the kerfuffle in the last week over immigration, the Supreme Court, Iran and Arnold Schwarzenegger's TV ratings, too little attention was paid to an extraordinary meeting at the White House at which President Trump reneged on a campaign promise and sold out millions of ""forgotten"" Americans to giant drug companies. The government's other big health insurance program, Medicaid, doesn't negotiate drug prices, either, but in most states, the law requires that Medicaid receive the lowest price charged to any private insurance plan. [...]Medicaid pays more than 20 percent less for drugs than Aetna or Blue Cross. The basic story about drug pricing goes like this: Because ours is the only country that does not negotiate prices with drug companies, using a national formulary, Americans pay roughly twice what patients in other countries do for the most widely used drugs still under patent. The result is higher profits for insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, but also higher out-of-pocket costs for consumers who have no insurance or whose insurance policies include large deductibles or co-payments for drug purchases.",1864986965,Newspapers," Pearlstein, Steven

Refugees are already well-vetted. I vetted them.,"The order, if it survives several ongoing legal challenges, bans entry for citizens of seven countries for 90 days, suspends all refugee admissions for 120 days, halves the total number of refugees allowed into the United States this year and bars refugees from Syria indefinitely.The process starts with the United Nations' refugee agency, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).Since the United States has been in Iraq for more than 10 years, the government has a plethora of information on Iraqis - in many cases, terrorists, criminals and persecutors are recognizable and denied.If a national security threat emerges, certain nationalities are placed under tighter scrutiny.According to a report recently released by the Cato Institute, out of millions of refugees resettled to the United States over several decades, just 20 have committed or attempted attacks.[...]not only does the executive order provide no logical benefit to national security, but such policies, if they survive in the courts, feed into the extremist narrative that America hates all Muslims - thereby hurting national security, as Michael Hayden, former CIA director during the George W. Bush administration, and other government officials have argued.The only explanation for his order is that the president is using refugees to appeal to his base at the expense of national security. outlook@washpost.com",1864986966,Newspapers," Hall, Natasha

"Life, death and demolition","INBALTIMORE The nine rowhouses a few blocks from Johns Hopkins Hospital stood for more than a century, through waves of immigration, two world wars, the upending of the city's economy and a shift in its racial makeup. The arched windows along the 900 block of North Bradford Street reflected both the boom and the decline of a great American city: the prosperous midcentury, when all nine households could afford the Formstone that covered their brick fronts; the tumult of 1968, when residents could smell the smoke from nearby riots; the white flight that would open the street to African Americans; and the drug wars that would drive many of them away. Since it was built on an old brickyard in 1905 by the ""two-story king of East Baltimore,"" hundreds of people have called the block home. Mable Olds, 69, the last resident of 936 N. Bradford, was on hand to see the government-paid excavator roll up to the house where she - and many mothers before her - had raised her family. Across the street, as he waited in the shade to load his dump truck with the 10 tons of debris each house would produce, ""Big Mike"" Saunders, 59, remembered his own mother.

DHS halts enforcement of entry ban,"administration files a notice of appeal Disagreement with judge could reach Supreme Court The Department of Homeland Security complied with a judge's orders Saturday and stopped enforcing President Trump's controversial entry ban, and the fast-moving legal dispute over the president's powers could land at the nation's highest court. On Saturday evening, Trump administration lawyers filed a notice to appeal the Seattle federal judge's decision from Friday night that imposed a temporary, nationwide halt to Trump's order barring refugees and those from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the country. Justice Department lawyers were preparing to immediately ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to dissolve Robart's order, but had not filed anything as of Saturday evening. Trump's criticism of Robart reminded some of his remarks during the presidential campaign about the impartiality of a California federal judge who was hearing a class-action lawsuit involving Trump University. Others counted that Obama had also been critical of judicial decisions he did not like - scolding the Supreme Court during a State of the Union address for its decision in Citizens United v.

Budweiser'super Bowl ad is big risk in Trump's USA,"Anheuser-Busch InBev unintentionally waded into political controversy with a 60-second Super Bowl commercial that touts inclusion and the American Dream but could end up drawing the ire of half the country.

"Fearing wider entry ban or less U.S. aid, Pakistan curbs Islamist militants","Therein lies the conundrum facing Pakistani officials today as they scramble to forestall punitive actions by the Trump administration - and ease pressure from other foreign partners, including China - without provoking turmoil at home, especially among Muslim militants the state has long coddled as proxies against India.White House aides suggested last week that the ban might be expanded to include Pakistan and other countries with terrorist links.On Saturday, Pakistani media outlets quoted a White House spokesman telling the BBC that there are ""no immediate plans"" to add Pakistan, Afghanistan or Lebanon but warning that this could change if the countries stop complying with U.S. requests for information. ""Pakistan is not merely an aspirant for cooperation with Washington, it is a serious and credible partner,"" Tariq Fatemi, a senior aide to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said in an interview Friday.Caren Firouz Reuters Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif looks out the window of his plane after attending a ceremony to inaugurate the M9 motorway between Karachi and Hyderabad, Pakistan February 3, 2017.",1864987246,Newspapers," Constable, Pamela

Bannon planned film about 'Islamic States of America',"The eight-page draft, written in 2007 during Bannon's stint as a Hollywood filmmaker, proposes a three-part movie that would trace ""the culture of intolerance"" behind sharia law, examine the ""Fifth Column"" made up of ""Islamic front groups"" and identify the American enablers paving ""the road to this unique hell on earth."" Walid Phares, a Lebanese-born Maronite Christian who has warned that jihadists are posing as civil rights advocates, and Heritage Foundation security expert James Jay Carafano, who has defended Trump's executive order. The proposal names two dozen conservative writers and terrorism experts who could serve as potential on-screen guests, including Robert Spencer, director of the Jihad Watch website, who is labeled by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-Muslim ""propagandist."" The proposal also lists other ""enablers,"" including The Post, the New York Times, NPR, ""Universities and the Left,"" the ""American Jewish Community,"" the ACLU, the CIA, the FBI, the State Department and the White House. Bannon's work on the ""Great Satan"" project came after the release of his well-received 2004 Ronald Reagan biopic, ""In the Face of Evil."" Bannon then produced political documentaries including ""Border War: The Battle Over Illegal Immigration""; ""Generation Zero,"" an examination of the global economic crisis; and ""Battle for America,"" which hammered an ""out-of-touch, arrogant, and ever-expanding central government.""",1864987363,Newspapers," Gold, Matea

The politics of globaloney,"All of this reflects genuine skepticism of the benefits of globalization, opposition to trade deals and anxiety about immigration among large portions of the U.S. population, protests notwithstanding. The United States is far less buffeted by international trade, immigration and other aspects of globalization than many Americans assume; the whole world is far less globalized than people tend to believe. Based on how much goods, services, capital, people and information flow across the nation's borders compared with how much stays inside the country, the United States ranks 100th out of 140 countries, according to the 2016 ""DHL Global Connectedness Index,"" which we released last November. [...]despite the American cliche that everything is made in China, less than 3 percent of money spent in the United States goes to Chinese imports - and a good portion of the price of Chinese products sold here actually goes to U.S. companies transporting, selling and marketing those goods. In his best-selling book ""The World Is Flat,"" updated twice since its initial 2005 publication, Thomas Friedman declares that we have witnessed the creation of ""a global, Web-enabled platform for multiple forms of collaboration. .. Only 6 percent of milk, 9 percent of rice, 12 percent of corn and 22 percent of wheat are traded internationally on a global basis, but trade is a savior when local harvests fall short.

Candidate's tendency to stoke fear continues in presidency,"""Because poor neighborhoods can't get any worse, why not try something new? Because America is already a jihadist battleground, why not take a radical and discriminatory new direction on immigration? Because the planet is in chaos, why not entirely reorient American foreign policy toward alliances and great power rivals? ""Things, after all, can't get any worse,"" Gerson continued. Perhaps most famous was the line that most Americans can still recite from Franklin D. Roosevelt's first inaugural address, when he told a country in the depth of the Great Depression that ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."" There were also other presidents - Bill Clinton in the wake of the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City, Bush standing on the rubble of the World Trade Center in 2001 - who seemed to grow into the job as they summoned the nation to defy what it feared rather than succumb to it. [...]after the Obama administration's struggles to respond to the civil war in Syria, and the gruesome images of the Islamic State beheading American hostages, the public grew more fearful. Chris Newman, an immigrant rights advocate with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said Trump has purposely blurred the lines of various potential threats to the country, including undocumented immigrants living here, refugees from abroad and even the unfounded claims that there were as many as 5 million illegal...",1864987408,Newspapers," Tumulty, Karen

Democrats' new Senate leader is facing a tight squeeze,"Schumer aims to satisfy his base while protecting minority caucus About every two weeks, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer keeps an important dinner date with five of his colleagues, and they're not the five most senior members of the Senate or even his closest advisers in his new job. If Democrats try to block Judge Neil Gorsuch, for instance - Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court - Republicans have the ability to eliminate the filibuster, which would enable Gorsuch's confirmation on a simple-majority vote. ""With each action testing the Constitution, and each personal attack on a judge, President Trump raises the bar even higher for Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Supreme Court,"" the lead Senate Democrat said in a statement. The situation for Democrats is so intense and personal that Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) were taunted by protesters during a rally on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 30. [...]they also risk galvanizing conservatives who favor the federal appeals court judge - and given how many within their party are vulnerable next year, they may not have the votes for a filibuster. In a Republican-controlled chamber, where the rules no longer allow Democrats to filibuster Cabinet nominees, Democrats tried slowing things down by burying nominees in hundreds of written follow-up questions, boycotting committee-room votes to protest their qualifications or Trump's latest actions, and then forcing the Senate to stretch out consideration of each pick.",1864987437,Newspapers," O'Keefe, Ed

Judge halts ban on entry to U.S.,"TEMPORARY ORDER APPLIES NATIONWIDE Tens of thousands of visas already revoked A federal judge in Washington state declared Friday that he would temporarily block enforcement of President Trump's controversial ban on entry to the United States - a ruling that appears to be broader than others before it, though the precise details have yet to be revealed. ""The order makes it clear that all of the main provisions of the executive order cannot be enforced at this time,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project. Since it was first rolled out a week ago, Trump's travel ban has been evolving - both because of legal challenges and as a result of decisions by the administration to walk back aspects of it. Among those who made their way back to the United States were two undergraduate Massachusetts Institute of Technology students who had been visiting their families for winter break; as well as 27-year-old Behnam Partopour, a PhD student from Iran studying chemical engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute who had been working on a project in Germany; and Samira Asgari, an Iranian scientist who was headed to Boston to conduct research at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Though federal judges in other parts of the country already had restrained enforcement of the ban, U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs's order in Boston went somewhat further - blocking U.S. officials from detaining or removing those who, ""absent the executive order, would be legally authorized to enter...",1864987472,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

United against immigration order; U.S. Jews' history and faith prompts many to oppose Trump's policies on Muslims.,"A Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council, made up of business and cultural leaders of both communities, both Democrats and Republicans, was formed days before the election and convened for its first regular meeting Wednesday in Washington to push the government for a coordinated response to hate crimes, up sharply against both Muslims and Jews. The week after the election, Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, raised eyebrows when he declared at a meeting in New York, ""This proud Jew will register as Muslim"" if Trump imposes a Muslim registry -- a dramatic statement for the head of an organization founded to fight anti-Semitism and protect Jewish identity. When a mosque in Texas was destroyed by fire on the weekend that the immigration ban was announced, members of a nearby Jewish congregation offered the keys to their synagogue so their Muslim neighbors would have a place to pray. Rabbi Jennie Rosenn, vice president for community engagement of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, was on the Greek island of Lesbos working with refugees when the news broke about Trump's executive order suspending immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and halting all refugee admissions. Trump's executive order prompted almost universal condemnation from the leading American Jewish organizations, which often squabble among themselves on issues relating to Israel and gay rights. Khalid Latif, an imam and head of the Islamic Center at New York University, said that just after the election, pro-Trump graffiti was scrawled in a Muslim student prayer room, while Jewish students found...",1864988951,Newspapers," Demick, Barbara

"How Circus Vargas keeps the show on the road; With no animal acts, it relies on human performers who work two or three jobs.","[...]circus life has become doubly difficult with new animal welfare regulations along with extensive fire safety codes and food preparation guidelines, said Gary Payne, president of the Circus Fans Assn. of America, an organization of retired performers, managers and other circus supporters. In addition to assigning workers double duty to keep costs down, Circus Vargas long ago ended its animal acts, which eliminated the expense of caring for and housing the creatures as well as cut the need to meet strict animal welfare regulations. Ringling Bros. cited changing public attitudes toward animal acts and tough animal welfare regulations as key reasons why it retired its elephants last year. After the elephants were pulled from the show's lineup, declining ticket sales at Ringling Bros. took an even steeper dive. ""What's happening is that the added regulations reflect the sensibility that it's unethical and unsafe for circuses to have wild animal acts,"" said Wayne Pacelle, chief executive of the Humane Society of the U.S. That movement, he said, also pushed SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment to stop breeding orcas and to replace theatrical killer whale shows with more educational productions.

CALIFORNIA JOURNAL; Puzzlement south of the border,"The police academy graduation ceremony in Tecate, Mexico, was a solemn affair. Police attribute the rise in crime not to the type of cartel violence that depressed the city and wreaked havoc on tourism in 2008, but to turf battles between small-time drug dealers. (The pair spoke by phone in an attempt to smooth over tensions after Pena Nieto canceled a White House meeting in response to Trump's gratuitous Twitter needling about who will pay for a border wall.) Sending troops is a ludicrous suggestion, even if it was made in jest, but sadly, it does not seem out of character for our commander in chief, who in his first two weeks inflicted a travel ban penalizing (mostly) Muslim refugees and immigrants, insulted the Australian prime minister, uttered conflicting messages about Israeli settlements and threatened to yank federal funds from UC Berkeley after a protest against Breitbart agitator Milo Yiannopoulos turned violent. Garcia covered the police academy graduation, and invited me to tag along. In windowless buildings, Mexican workers make Samsung TVs, medical instruments, overhead compartments for airplanes, mostly for export. Tahmooressi was represented by Fernando Benitez, a Tijuana criminal defense attorney who frequently represents Americans.",1864989150,Newspapers," Abcarian, Robin

ORDERS AT ODDS; Trump puts LAPD policy on immigrants back in focus,"[...]in 1979, responding to the influx of illegal immigration, it was Gates who issued the policy that has since defined a tolerant posture toward the immigrant community -- a policy employed by the LAPD and scores of other law enforcement agencies across the nation.Special Order 40 prohibited officers from initiating contact with anyone for the sole purpose of learning their immigration status and ruled out arrests for violation of U.S. immigration law.Gates retired in 1992 under fire for his failure to prepare for the riots that followed acquittals in the police beating of Rodney King.[...]LAPD gang czar John D. White, a deputy chief, told the City Council's Public Safety Committee that because witnesses and victims of gang violence means of getting gang members off the streets -- by deporting them under federal law.The most visceral challenge to Special Order 40 followed the fatal shooting in 2008 of Jamiel Shaw II, a 17-year-old African American high school football player, by a gang member who was in the country illegally.The youth's parents, Jamiel Shaw Sr. and Anita Shaw, an Army sergeant who had served in Iraq, asked the City Council to change the policy so officers would routinely check the immigration status of known gang members who are crime suspects.

'It doesn't feel as welcoming'; The joy of becoming a U.S. citizen is subdued by uncertainty after travel ban,"The mayor and a state senator stood beneath a basketball hoop in the gym. The ceremony -- run by Kristi Barrows, director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' Denver district -- featured fifth-graders singing ""This Land Is Your Land"" and short speeches by U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) and Fort Collins Mayor Wade Troxell. The senator's mother was smuggled out of the Warsaw Ghetto during the Nazi occupation of Poland during World War II. Sameen Abbasi, a 29-year-old from Pakistan, was excited to join her husband as a fellow U.S. citizen, and the couple sought out Bennet after the ceremony to thank him for his statement opposing Trump's executive order. Of those countries named by Trump in the executive order, only Iraq and Iran cracked the top 20 for the number of people naturalized -- a combined total of about 25,000 people in 2015, according to Homeland Security.

"Travel ban rebuff tests presidency; As Trump lashes out at judge's sweeping order, Justice Dept. plans to appeal.","The Department of Homeland Security said Saturday that it had suspended ""any and all actions"" related to Trump's executive action a day after federal Judge James L. Robart issued a temporary restraining order, effective nationwide, in response to a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota. On Saturday night, the Justice Department said it would appeal the order by Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush who is now senior judge of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The case heads next to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in California and perhaps the Supreme Court to decide whether Robart's temporary restraining order should remain in effect. Trump and his advisors had largely downplayed the confusion his order sparked and contended that it was on solid legal ground, even though on Monday he dismissed the acting attorney general who had told Justice Department attorneys to cease defending it in court.

Keillor, who notes he and his wife are adopting a 2-year-old Mexican boy, added, ""If we eventually move back to the U.S., we come from a very homogeneous part of Minnesota, a very red politically part of Minnesota, are we going to be very excited to bring our Mexican son to live there?"" A movement to buy Mexican products is also being pushed in friendly conversation and by government officials.

Up to 8 million may be targeted for deportation; Almost anyone who entered U.S. illegally could be detained under executive order.,"Trump's deportation priorities also include smaller groups whose totals remain elusive: people in the country illegally who are charged with crimes that have not yet been adjudicated and those who receive improper welfare benefits, use fake identity cards, are found driving without licenses or receive federal food assistance.An additional executive order under consideration would block entry to anyone the U.S. believes may use benefit programs such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, according two Trump administration officials who have seen the draft order.The changes reflect an effort to deter illegal migration by increasing the threat of deportation and cutting off access to social services and work opportunities to encourage what 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney called ""self-deportation.""[...]Trump plans to empower local police to work with immigration agents to identify people they believe live illegally in their cities and towns, particularly those seen as violent, the White House official said, comparing the arrest of a suspected gang leader on an immigration violation to the FBI charging a mafia leader with tax evasion.The approach is similar to Arizona's ""papers, please"" law that was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2012 on the grounds that the state was trying to enforce federal immigration laws.

Administration Files an Appeal of Travel Ruling,"The Trump administration filed an appeal late Saturday night of a Federal District Court ruling that blocked the president's immigration order, setting the stage for a legal showdown over his authority to tighten the nation's borders in the name of protecting Americans from terrorism. The legal maneuvering led Mr. Trump to lash out at Judge James Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle throughout the day, prompting criticism that the president had failed to respect the judicial branch and its power to check on his authority. In an early-morning Twitter post, Mr. Trump wrote, ""The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"" The Justice Department's filing seeks to have the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit block the judge's decision and asks that the lower court's ruling be stayed pending the appeal. In emergency matters, the appeals court's rules sometimes allow a single judge to act alone, or to convene a three-judge panel by telephone. A State Department official said the extended time frame accounted for the fact that some refugees will have to make difficult journeys back to airports from refugee camps. [...]there is a new order from the courts, the official said, the department will go back to vetting refugees, booking their travel and bringing them to the United States.

The Trump Effect: Time to Buckle Up,"Let's just say that fastening your seatbelt is probably a smart move. Because stock and bond markets usually dislike surprises, bombshells coming by way of executive orders are not very likely to be well received. Witness the 1 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average and the even larger declines in foreign stock markets immediately after Mr. Trump's executive order on immigration. Mr. Kotok points to widening spreads between interest rates such as the prevailing London Interbank Offered Rate (or Libor) and the rates on forward loan contracts traded by banks and corporations. The number of international students in the country has grown 70 percent over the past decade -- to 5 percent of total enrollment, or more than one million students, said Patricia Healy, a portfolio manager at Cumberland Advisors who specializes in municipal bonds.

"Amid turmoil, many wonder what's next","[...]as church members consider another order -- restricting refugees -- worries about security are tempered by concern about the needs of refugees and whether Trump's rhetoric is widening the gulf between Americans, Bergman said.The next day, she told a crowd gathered at the county courthouse in Bloomington, Ind., about how her relatives had fled Syria by boat and ended up in a refugee camp before finding refuge in Germany.Students were dismayed when they read about false statements by White House press secretary Sean Spicer and by an interview with Trump adviser Steve Bannon in which he compared himself to Darth Vader.Juan Villamizar, a 52-year-old flooring business owner in West Hartford, Conn., said he supports Trump's executive order restricting refugees and immigration as a way to protect Americans from terrorism.During the presidential campaign, Brenda Horvath strapped a ""Make America Great Again"" sign to her Logan, W.Va., front porch.",1864996808,Newspapers," Geller, Adam

"The fearless and almost forgotten Jun Fujita, in verse and pictures","Here is one of that book's poems: A sudden caw, lost in the air, Leaves the hillside to the autumn sun; Save a leaf or two curling Not a sound is here.By 1910 he was here, finding work as a train porter, a domestic servant, construction worker and an actor, appearing in several films shot at the Essanay Studios on the North Side.Vitali, who produced an artful segment for Wednesday's ""Chicago Tonight"" program (www.chicagotonight.wttw.com/video), first became aware of the photographer two years ago, when he was doing a story about an exhibition at Roosevelt University's Gage Gallery titled ""Above the Fold: 10 Decades of Chicago Photojournalism"" and noticed Fujita's name alongside that famous photo of the St. Valentine's Day massacre.After his newspaper days, Fujita operated a photo booth at the 1933-34 Century of Progress World's Fair here and later ran a commercial photo studio that did work for corporate clients.In sharp contrast to the visceral horrors he captured for newspapers, his private work focused on the less harsh and hard natural world.[...]I feel words are too crude for the delicate moods of wild flowers."" ---------- rkogan@chicagotribune.com Caption: Photo: Jun Fujita, one of the first Asian-American photojournalists, was at the scene of the SS Eastland when it went down in the Chicago River in the summer of 1915, killing 844 people.JUN FUJITA PHOTO Photo: Fujita shot photos during the 1919 race riots in Chicago, here showing children celebrating after raiding the home of African-Americans.",1864997146,Newspapers," Kogan, Rick

Up to 8 million could be deported,"When President Donald Trump ordered a vast overhaul of immigration law enforcement during his first week in office, he stripped away most restrictions on who should be deported, opening the door for roundups and detentions on a scale not seen in nearly a decade.Even the Social Security system, which many immigrants working illegally pay into under fake identification numbers, would take a hit.An additional executive order under consideration would block entry to anyone the U.S. believes may use benefit programs such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, according to two Trump administration officials who have seen the draft order.The changes reflect an effort to deter illegal migration by increasing the threat of deportation and cutting off access to social services and work opportunities, an approach that 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney called ""self-deportation.""[...]Trump plans to empower local police to work with immigration agents to identify people they believe live illegally in their cities and towns, particularly those seen as violent, the White House official said.",1864997385,Newspapers," Bennett, Brian

Favoritism unsettles Mideast Christians,"In Damascus, Syria, a Christian lawyer, speaking of President Donald Trump's pledge to prioritize Christians in refugee admissions, called it bigoted and part of a plot to rob the Arab world of its diversity. The criticism by some Christians in the Arab world was a striking addition to the global chorus of consternation over Trump's executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days while allowing exceptions for religious minorities. Trump said in an interview last month that persecuted Christians would be given priority in resettlement, and focused his comments on Syrian Christians who had suffered at the hands of the Islamic State militant group. More than a dozen interviews with Christians in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and other countries revealed sharply divided opinions about the ban, with some -- especially those in the diaspora or uprooted, possibly permanently, from their homes -- praising Trump for highlighting the historical persecution of Christians, although they emphasized that it was unclear whether he would follow through with his pledge. [...]there was notable discomfort, too, about a foreign leader showing favoritism to one minority group in an ever more divided Middle East, that struck some as an echo of sectarian tactics practiced...",1865015006,Newspapers," Fahim, Kareem

DOJ will fight to maintain travel ban,"The Department of Homeland Security said Saturday that it had suspended ""any and all actions"" related to Trump's executive action after federal judge James Robart issued a temporary restraining order, effective nationwide, in response to a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota. On Saturday, the Justice Department filed a formal notice of appeal seeking to overturn the order by Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush who is now senior judge of the U.S. District for the Western District of Washington. The case heads next to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco and perhaps eventually the Supreme Court to decide whether Robart's temporary restraining order should remain in effect. Trump's executive order, which also includes a temporary ban on most refugee admissions and indefinitely for Syrians, was one of several the president has signed since taking office, part of a White House strategy designed to begin implementing his governing vision with maximum impact. Congressional leaders have been furious after being cut out of the White House's planning and execution of the travel ban, and they continued Saturday scrambling to repair the chaotic rollout.",1865224621,Newspapers," Memoli, Michael A

Echoes of Vietnam-era protests in today's demonstrations,"The protesters who recently flooded the country's airports, in response to President Trump's ban on refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, carried handmade signs declaring the United States a nation of immigrants, and some of those signs took a longer view of the latest immigrant backlash. For a book concerned with memory, perhaps its biggest flaw is that it tends to assume that Americans have a knowledge of their own history - that they know, for example, about the moratoriums, as those massive marches against the Vietnam War were called. [...]important the antiwar movement was, however much it served as an umbrella for the analysis of the New Left, it is as critical to remember the distinct movements against racism, poverty and exploitation as it is to remember the resistance to the Cold War consensus that a massive amount of blood was worth shedding to contain communism. Hell No The Forgotten Power of the Vietnam Peace Movement By Tom Hayden Yale. 159 pp. $25 Description ""Hell No"" is brief yet rambling; reading it feels as if one is listening to Hayden reminisce, wandering backward and forward in time, recalling some events in great detail and others with the barest mention.

Democrats see a question for Gorsuch in Trump tweets,"President Trump's Twitter assault on the ""so-called judge"" who put a nationwide hold on the president's executive order on immigration has motivated Democrats to challenge Trump's choice for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, on an important but elusive issue. ""With each action testing the Constitution, and each personal attack on a judge, President Trump raises the bar even higher for Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Supreme Court,"" Schumer said in a statement. Gorsuch, 49, who has served for 10 years as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver, is a well-credentialed Republican and has been an outspoken conservative since his high school days. On the question of executive power, there are no more than ""hints,"" according to Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who has written about Gorsuch's views questioning judicial deference to executive agencies. The ""Chevron deference"" is based on a long-standing Supreme Court decision that is little known to the public but vitally important to the functioning of the federal government.",1865132599,Newspapers," Barnes, Robert

"Trump's team isn't diverse, as photo ops make obvious","""Where are the women?"" Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) asked rhetorically on the House floor last week, holding up a photo of Trump flanked by Vice President Pence and six male advisers in the Oval Office a day after he signed an order restricting federal funds for abortion-related activities in foreign countries. During his inaugural address, Trump stood on the veranda of the U.S. Capitol and declared ""an oath of allegiance to all Americans."" Two days later, after millions of women had demonstrated against his administration in marches in Washington and across the country, Trump presided over a swearing-in ceremony for two dozen senior White House staffers. Beyond the White House, Trump's choices to fill 21 Cabinet-level positions include 16 white men, four women (including two Asian Americans) and one African American man, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. A day after he signed the abortion funding ban, the president invited reporters into the Oval Office for another round of executive orders. The entry ban set off major protests Jan. 28 across the country amid reports that federal agents had detained more than 100 foreign travelers, including some who had green cards allowing them legal permanent residence in the country.",1865132600,Newspapers," Nakamura, David

Trump order is in legal limbo,"Ban is paused until at least monday President criticizes judge as travelers rush back A federal appeals court on Sunday ruled that President Trump's controversial immigration order will remain suspended for the time being, allowing those previously banned from coming to the United States at least another day to get here. The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit preserves a lower judge's order to temporarily halt the ban - and based on a schedule the court outlined, the stop will remain in place at least until sometime on Monday. Federal courts in New York, California and elsewhere have blocked aspects of the ban from being implemented, although one federal judge in Massachusetts declared that he did not think that challengers had demonstrated that they had a high likelihood of success. Legal analysts have said that the president has broad authority to set immigration policy, although civil liberties advocates have countered that the order essentially amounts to a discriminatory ban on Muslims that has no real national security purpose. Early Sunday, the Justice Department asked the appeals court to intervene, asserting that it was improper for a lower court to engage in ""second-guessing"" of the president's judgment on a national security matter. ""The injunction contravenes the constitutional separation of powers; harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the nation's elected representative responsible for immigration matters and foreign affairs; and second-guesses the President's national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed...",1865132649,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

A rush to return to U.S. amid stay of travel ban,"CHICAGO - People can enter after court refuses request to reinstate order CHICAGO - After a federal appeals court early Sunday denied an initial request by the Trump administration to reinstate its controversial travel ban, a crush of people stranded in legal limbo rushed to fly back to the United States during the temporary stay. Sunday's ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit capped several days of chaos as airlines and immigration authorities adjusted to a constantly changing landscape of court rulings and federal guidance on the executive order that barred refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. A judge in a lower federal court had put a temporary stop to the travel ban. Because the appeals court declined to intervene immediately, affected travelers can enter until at least Monday. The appeals court asked challengers to the ban to file a response by roughly 3 a.m. Eastern on Monday and the Justice Department to reply to that by 6 p.m. The court's decision not to intervene meant Abdusebur Jemal could be reunited with his wife, Rudaynah, and their toddler daughter, Haifa. [...]I have a chance to be a dad. According to her attorney, she was forced to sign a form relinquishing her visa and put on a flight back to Khartoum.

Online pundits use 'bots' to turn tweets into roars,"Researchers have documented the power of automation technology to magnify some points of view while drowning out others.[...]Sobieski adds what he calls ""the coup de grace,"" plucking an image from his ever-growing digital library of illustrations.Twitter, which declined multiple requests for comment, is more easily manipulated than some other social media platforms, researchers say, because it allows anonymous users and tolerates some degree of automation of its accounts.In the U.S. presidential election, 19 percent of all tweets related to the campaign during one five-week stretch probably came from bots, according to University of Southern California researchers Alessandro Bessi and Emilio Ferrara.Is it fair that I can get downtown faster using a car than if you are using a bike?"" Before Sobieski discovered Twitter, he was a prolific writer of letters to the editor, penning thousands to Chicago-area newspapers while also crafting occasional on-air replies to liberal editorial positions of local television stations.(During Sobieski's decades writing letters to the editor, one of his day jobs was working as a programmer for a company that, in its computer room, featured a satiric German sign that translated as, roughly, ""Warning: Don't touch the machine with the blinking lights!"" Sobieski named his account for one of the words in that sign, ""gefingerpoken,"" accidentally misspelling it with an extra ""r,"" as ""gerfingerpoken."")",1865132727,Newspapers," Timberg, Craig

The travel ban hurts American spies - and America,"Michael V. Hayden, a principal at the Chertoff Group and visiting professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government, was director of the National Security Agency from 1999 to 2005 and the Central Intelligence Agency from 2006 to 2009. To be fair, it would have been hard to explain since it was not the product of intelligence and security professionals demanding change, but rather policy, political and ideological personalities close to the president fulfilling a campaign promise to deal with a threat they had overhyped. Paradoxically, they pointed out how the executive order breached faith with those very sources, many of whom they had promised to always protect with the full might of our government and our people. [...]as a former station chief told me, in the places where intelligence officers operate, rumor, whisper and conspiratorial chatter rule people's lives.

CAPITOL JOURNAL; Can Trump really cut off funding?,"For one thing, court decisions have restricted a president's ability to hold back federal money from state and local governments. [...]an executive order such as the one Trump signed is not a statute. Trump's executive order notified sanctuary cities and counties -- there are about 40 in California -- that they'll lose federal funds if they don't start cooperating with immigration agents, especially concerning criminals. The president's order says it's his policy to ""ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable federal law do not receive federal funds, except as mandated by law."" [...]because of court nexus decisions, the feds apparently could eliminate federal dollars to a law enforcement agency if it didn't cooperate on illegal immigration. Trump: ""If U.C.

"Investors grow more cautious about Trump; After an initial boost to financial markets, Wall Street hesitates over administration's tumultuous start.","[...]Trump's executive order on immigration, seen by many as impetuous, and his proclivity for making harsh remarks, whether directed at foreign leaders, lawmakers or anyone else opposed to his agenda, have raised questions about his ability to govern, particularly as they stirred frustrations among Republican leaders and some inside his own administration.Trump's immigration order, which barred entry into the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority nations, drew public dissent from a range of business leaders, including top executives at Ford Motor Co. and Goldman Sachs.Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber, told Trump last week that he was dropping out of the president's business advisory council, slashing the 35% corporate tax rate by more than half and offering a 10% tax on repatriated cash now kept abroad, which would be of particular benefit to tech firms such as Apple and Google that have tens of billions of dollars sheltered in offshore accounts.[...]tax reform efforts look to be fraught with obstacles, especially after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer indicated the Trump team was considering a controversial 20% border-adjustment tax on imports.The idea has divided the business community and Republicans, and is broadly opposed by liberals as it is part of an overall income tax-cut plan that would disproportionately benefit wealthy households.",1865145910,Newspapers," Lee, Don

"White House digs in for travel; Trump attacks judge in the case and also praises Putin, drawing GOP alarm. He again threatens California.","After a federal appeals court on Sunday rejected President Trump's emergency bid to reinstate his contentious travel ban, the White House signaled fresh determination to push forward in a legal dispute that is fast becoming a test of executive power.Trump's 10-day-old directive -- which also temporarily halted the arrival of all refugees coming to the U.S. -- sparked worldwide debate over religious discrimination, briefly locked out tens of thousands of valid U.S. visa holders and rattled some close American allies.The result of Trump's latest remarks was that Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans found themselves spending as much time defending and explaining the president's comments as advocating for the travel ban.Several GOP lawmakers took issue with Trump's personal attacks on the judge and his comments about Putin, rejecting any moral comparison between the Russian leader and the U.S. ""I don't understand language like that,"" Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said on ABC's ""This Week.Pence also defended the decision-making process behind the travel ban, one of a flurry of executive orders in Trump's first days in the Oval Office.Groups including the American Civil Liberties Union say they hope to overturn the travel ban on constitutional grounds.",1865145939,Newspapers," King, Laura

"For now, it's business as usual on the border; Officials struggle to interpret Trump's agenda","Trump's executive order instructs the Department of Homeland Security to immediately ""establish contracts to construct, operate or control"" immigrant detention facilities at or near the border, but many experts warn that ramping up the immigrant detention system will be costly and fraught with legal challenges. In 2014, the agency built two facilities in Texas -- the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley and the Karnes County Residential Center in Karnes City -- to accommodate the surge of Central American women and children arriving on the U.S. border seeking asylum. With many detention centers in remote areas, detainees already struggle to secure legal advice, a crucial factor in having a successful asylum claim. Chris Cabrera, vice president of the Rio Grande Valley's chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents, welcomed Trump's plan to end ""catch and release,"" saying he hoped it would stem the flow of immigrants. Last year, a Homeland Security advisory committee urged the Obama administration to stop the widespread practice of family detention, reserving it only for rare cases when release might pose a danger or flight risk. ""Detention centers are not a place for families and children,"" said Sister Norma Pimentel, executive director that thrived under Obama's administration is likely to exacerbate poor conditions at detention centers, said Carl Takei, a staff attorney at the ACLU's National Prison Project who wrote a 2016 report on detainee deaths, suicides and substandard medical care at detention facilities.

Lifting of Ban Sets Off Rush to Reach U.S.,"The rush inundated some domestic and international airports, reunited loved ones and friends, and prompted another round of criticism from Mr. Trump that national security was being endangered by court orders that blocked his tight border policy from taking effect.The back and forth had sown confusion, anxiety, fear and disbelief, but the court order created ""a temporary window that we wish to take advantage of,"" said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental agency that facilitates refugee resettlement.Families and immigration advocacy groups were buoyed twice over the weekend -- first when the Seattle judge temporarily blocked the executive order, and again when the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco denied the government's attempt to gain an emergency stay.Because of the last-minute change, Ms. Aizenman said that refugee family may have to live briefly in temporary housing, and settle for a restaurant meal rather than something homemade.The lawyers were stationed in shifts at airports across the country, observing customs officials to ensure that the Seattle judge's ruling was being carried out, and counseling refugees and visa holders on how to prepare for issues that could arise with their immigration status.",1865152059,Newspapers," Dickerson, Caitlin

President vows to win legal fight on travel ban,"After a federal appeals court on Sunday rejected President Donald Trump's emergency bid to reinstate his contentious travel ban, the White House signaled fresh determination to push forward in a legal dispute that is fast becoming a test of executive power. The result of Trump's latest remarks was that Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans found themselves spending as much time defending and explaining the president's comments as advocating for the travel ban. Several GOP lawmakers took issue with Trump's personal attacks on the judge and his comments about Putin, rejecting any moral comparison between the Russian leader and the U.S. ""I don't understand language like that,"" Sen. Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said on ABC's ""This Week. Pence also defended the decision-making process behind the travel ban, one of a flurry of executive orders in Trump's first days in the Oval Office. Pence said the White House would abide by the court's decision, but he expressed unhappiness over what he described as judicial efforts to improperly interfere with the president's authority.",1865212700,Newspapers," King, Laura

Why is returning to normalcy revolutionary?,"Democrats had believed that the unique racial heritage, youth and rhetorical skills of Obama would help him avoid the fate of previous failed Northern liberal candidates Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis and John Kerry. Given 21st-century demography, Democrats rejected the conventional wisdom that only a conservative Democrat with a Southern accent could win the popular vote (e.g., Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Al Gore). [...]Obama mostly ran on normal Democratic policies rather than a hard-left agenda. Culturally, the iconic symbols of the Obama revolution were the ""you didn't build that"" approach to businesses and an assumption that race/class/gender would forever drive American politics, favorably so for the Democrats. Freezing federal hiring, clamping down on lobbyists and auditing big bureaucracies -- after the Obama-era IRS, VA, GSA, EPA, State Department and Secret Service scandals -- are overdue.

Anxious Investors Seek Refuge in Gold --- Metal pushes higher as shifting political scene unnerves some; an unusual divergence,"  Demand for gold and other haven assets soared in 2011, driving prices to an all-time high of around $1,900 a troy ounce. Besides France's April 23 vote, challenges from antiestablishment parties loom in Dutch, German and Italian elections this year. Silver tends to rise more than gold when investors are nervous and to fall more than gold when they turn sanguine, reflecting factors including the lower price of silver on a per-ounce basis and the typically thinner trading in silver markets. Besides getting a lift from heightened political uncertainty, silver has also benefited from expectations of a strengthening global economy.",1865394321,Newspapers," Iosebashvili, Ira

"The long way home, twice","The reunion was a year-and-a-half in the making for the brothers from Yemen, whose hopes to live in the UnSited States seemed uncertain, even impossible, after President Trump signed an executive order banning travelers from their home country and others.The brothers are the face of one of the first court cases challenging Trump's ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries.A lawsuit filed on their behalf in federal court in Alexandria led to one of the first court orders restricting the ban.[...]a federal judge in Washington state has put the ban on hold, and tens of thousands of visas have been reinstated.Life was fraying Aquel Aziz came to the United States in 2001 on a student visa and soon applied for a green card.Aziz recalled pulling up in a taxi outside a house he didn't recognize; two boys whom he at first did not realize were his sons ran alongside it.The Justice Department has been settling these cases on an individual basis, and there is no public record of how many visas were canceled or why.Despite the court order from the federal judge in Washington state and an agreement with the Justice Department to bring the brothers back, lawyers at the Virginia-based Legal Aid Justice Center said they had to call Djibouti repeatedly to ensure that Tareq and Ammar were permitted on their flight.",1865412968,Newspapers," Weiner, Rachel

Democrats Appear to Find a Bulwark Against Trump: Attorneys General,"Amid mounting protests and emotional scenes of disorder at American airports, it offered a galvanizing first challenge for a gang of Democratic attorneys general who have vowed to check the power of the White House.In interviews, more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general, governors and party operatives detailed a week of frenzied litigation, late-night and early-morning phone calls and text messages, and strategies devised on airplanes and at sporting events.Several state attorneys general have cited as an inspiration the long-running legal war waged against the Obama administration by Republican attorneys general, who derailed key White House policies on immigration and nearly voided the Affordable Care Act.Mr. Jankowski, a lawyer, said Democratic attorneys general would probably rely heavily on the Constitution's civil rights protections, much as Republicans leaned on constitutional limits on federal economic power.The Struggle in Court Over the first weekend Mr. Trump's executive order was in effect, groups like the American Civil Liberties Union charged into court and won temporary restraining orders blocking key parts of it.Yet rather than demonstrating weakness, the diffuse nature of the Democratic legal response ended up working to the state attorneys general's advantage, effectively allowing Mr. Trump's foes to test multiple strategies before multiple federal judges.",1865420256,Newspapers," Burns, Alexander

While Barack Obama's election renewed discussion of the nation's tortured racial history and Hillary Clinton's would have spawned a look back at women's rights, historians say the speed and breadth of Trump's policy pronouncements have prompted the electorate to deploy history as an offensive or defensive rhetorical weapon.

Ex-officials: Trump imperils security,"Signed by former president Barack Obama's national security adviser, his top counterterrorism aide and his secretary of state, as well as other senior security officials from the past three administrations, the brief was filed in support of Friday's federal court ruling that froze Trump's executive order on immigration. Seeking to build on the model of the now-defunct National Security Network, a group of progressive Democrats espousing ""pragmatic and principled"" national security policies that was formed after John F. Kerry's loss in the 2004 election, Obama officials led by former acting secretary of homeland security Rand Beers, former Defense Department official Vikram Singh and Jake Sullivan, a senior White House and State Department adviser who joined Hillary Clinton's campaign, have been gathering adherents and seeking funding. In addition to disrupting lives, ""there is no national security purpose"" for an order that, they wrote, ""will endanger U.S. troops in the field""; ""disrupt...",1865420827,Newspapers," DeYoung, Karen

Universities weigh 'sanctuary' label after moves to tighten immigration,"[...]the dek goes here and here Soon after Donald Trump's election in November, Jason Ruiz helped launch a petition at the University of Notre Dame calling on the president of the nation's most prominent Catholic school to declare itself a ""sanctuary campus"" and offer protections for undocumented students, staff and family members facing the threat of deportation. Sensing that DACA could be in danger, colleges and universities have sought to address the impact that ending it would have on their campuses and assess their role in responding to students worried that they could be forced to leave school or even the United States. The campus sanctuary movement has angered Republicans who say schools that announce such policies are overplaying their hand by signaling a willingness to break the law. Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.) has proposed the No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act, a bill to cut off federal funding...",1865420938,Newspapers," Heim, Joe

"Travel Ban, Aimed at Terrorists, Touches Doctors in Hard-to-Fill Jobs","Foreign-born physicians ""are the doctors in small towns in Maine and Iowa,"" said Dr. Patricia F. Walker, the associate director of the University of Minnesota's Global Health Pathway, which helps refugee doctors practice in the United States. A federal judge in Seattle lifted the administration's travel ban on Friday, and a federal appeals court has declined to restore it. Foreign-born graduates have often worked at world-class institutions and have published academic papers, so they have higher average scores than American graduates on the medical knowledge portions of the licensing examinations, according to Merritt Hawkins research -- though most initially score lower on the clinical skills portions, which include English and communication skills. [...]foreign-born graduates must return home when their visas expire, but they can get extensions if they agree to work in an area that the Department of Health and Human Services considers ""medically underserved,"" which is roughly defined as having less than one primary care doctor for every 3,000 people. Citing figures from the Iowa Board of Medicine, The Des Moines Register reported last week that 172 doctors practicing in Iowa were from the seven countries subject to Mr. Trump's travel ban, and that 23 percent of the state's 13,000 practicing doctors were born outside the United States. [...]after passing his medical exam, he completed his residency at the University of Cincinnati and a fellowship in hematology and oncology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

BACK STORY; A tangle of legal challenges; Trump's travel ban faces dozens of lawsuits amid widespread confusion,"Since President Trump signed a sweeping executive order that temporarily banned entry for refugees, as well as other immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries, dozens of lawsuits have been filed amid widespread confusion over the new immigration rules.On Monday, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco was considering legal briefs on both sides after initially denying a request to reinstate the travel ban, whose enforcement was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Seattle on Friday.Most were filed by legal permanent residents who were detained, deported or blocked from boarding flights to the U.S. They were filed in federal district courts in Virginia, Massachusetts, California, the District of Columbia and elsewhere.[...]another part of the act says there cannot be discrimination in regard to ""the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence"" when it comes to ""the issuance of an immigrant visa.""The arguments against the executive order have been multi-pronged, most alleging a violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution, as well as the Constitution's ban on government religion.The fight against the travel ban will be a long one, said Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan who was the head of civil rights for the Department of Homeland Security under President Obama.",1865423204,Newspapers," Kaleem, Jaweed

The order had an immediate affect on the travel plans of Abdullah and many far more desperate than him -- refugees and asylum seekers whose lives were in danger in their home countries. Valid visa holders are still being detained at U.S. airports and sent back to where they came from. Early Saturday morning it looked as if the most recent restraining order on the travel ban was being honored at most U.S. airports.

ANALYSIS; Case is early test of the limits of executive power,"Even before Donald Trump entered the White House, many were predicting federal courts would serve as an important check on his use of presidential power, particularly given his aggressive style and a GOP-led Congress that has so far been loath to confront him.The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco is considering a request from the Justice Department to reinstate the ban after a Seattle federal judge suspended its implementation last week.Trump's campaign promise to impose a Muslim ban, his recent tweets attacking the GOP-appointed judge who ruled against him and the White House's clumsy handling of the order's implementation may change the calculation.Last year, in a similar case involving presidential power, the justices split 4 to 4 and could not decide whether a Texas judge had wrongly blocked an executive action by President Obama that would have given temporary relief from deportation and work permits to more than 4 million immigrants living illegally in the country.[...]of the tie vote, a lower court ruling that blocked Obama's program remained in effect.The state's lawyers had contended the order violated ""due process of law"" because it changed the rules without warning for foreign travelers, and they said it discriminated based on religion and national origin.",1865425287,Newspapers," Savage, David G

Justice Dept. Says a Ban on Travel Is Vital to Safety,"The Justice Department on Monday evening urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump's targeted travel ban, saying immediate action was needed to ensure the nation's safety. The administration's brief was the last in a series of urgent pleas to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which is now set to rule on the most ambitious and disruptive initiative of Mr. Trump's young presidency. Trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump's executive order, which suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation's refugee program, but none of those cases have reached an appeals court. The officials filing the declaration included John Kerry, a secretary of state under Mr. Obama; Madeleine K. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton; Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama's national security adviser; and Leon E. Panetta, secretary of defense and director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump's order, the officials said, would endanger American troops and intelligence sources, disrupt counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts, damage the economy and have ""a devastating humanitarian impact.",1865425618,Newspapers," Liptak, Adam

LEGAL ARGUMENTS IN THE CASE,"A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to reach a decision after the Trump administration files further arguments by 3 p.m. Monday. ""The injunction contravenes the constitutional separation of powers; harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an executive order issued by the nation's elected representative responsible for immigration matters and foreign affairs; and second-guesses the president's national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of aliens and the best means of minimizing that risk.""[...]defendants cite Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972), and Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128 (2015), for the proposition that so long as the president gives a facially legitimate reason for excluding an alien, the courts will not look behind that reason.[...]Justice [Anthony M.] Kennedy's controlling opinion in Din held that courts should look behind the stated motives for exclusion even as to a nonresident alien if the plaintiff 'plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity' 'an affirmative showing of bad faith.'ECF 18 42-61.[...]courts have both the right and the duty to examine defendants' true motives.""In 1965, Congress prohibited discrimination on the basis of national origin precisely so that the nation could not shut its doors to immigrants based on where they come from.[...]any discretion under the immigration laws must be exercised reasonably, and subject to meaningful constraints.""",1865425867,Newspapers," Dolan, Maura

"Tech firms fight travel ban; Apple, Google, Snap are among 100-plus that side with judge in Washington state.","More than 100 technology companies -- including industry big guns Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, and newcomers such as Snap, Lyft and Scopely -- joined forces Sunday to file a friend-of-the-court brief, arguing against President Trump's ban on refugees and travel from seven predominantly Muslim nations.The joint brief, filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in support of a Washington judge's move to halt enforcement of the executive order, contends the ban is unconstitutional, unfair and, above all else, bad for business.Part of it is optics, according to public relations experts, who cited mounting pressure internally from employees and externally from customers as a reason for firms jumping on the bandwagon.The companies warned that the instability and uncertainty the travel ban has created may incentivize immigration and foreign investment to countries other than the U.S. They also warned that multinational companies may decide to move their operations abroad, which would probably have adverse effects on the U.S. economy.The technology industry relies heavily on foreign talent, particularly in light of the domestic talent shortage in fields such as science, engineering and mathematics.",1865426314,Newspapers," Lien, Tracey

"Brazil swings right, setting stage for a Trump-like leader","Brazilian President Michel Temer took office five months ago after the impeachment and political humiliation of the country's first female political leader, Dilma Rousseff, ousting her left-wing Workers' Party after 14 years in power.The next presidential election is not until 2018, but in municipal-level contests held in October, Rousseff's once-dominant Workers' Party was trounced, losing 60 percent of the city government seats it controlled.According to leaked plea bargain testimony, a jailed former construction executive has accused Temer of soliciting nearly $3 million in illegal campaign funds.After the Supreme Court justice overseeing the Car Wash probe died in a plane crash last month, Temer said he would wait to nominate a replacement until the justice's colleagues - and not Temer - could decide who would take over the case.To cap it off, anger over the perceived slight to women was compounded by the fact that Temer got his job by replacing the country's first female president, with his party driving the impeachment proceedings.The global shift to the right poses a threat to the gains of Brazil's feminist movement, she added, saying that Brazilians should draw inspiration from the U.S. women's march that followed Trump's inauguration.",1865705663,Newspapers," Miroff, Nick

"In court, pointed questions on ban","The three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit aggressively questioned a Justice Department lawyer about what he considered the limits on the president's power and what evidence Trump relied upon in temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.[...]the panel similarly interrogated Washington state's solicitor general, who is challenging the president's directive, over what evidence he had to demonstrate religious discrimination and whether a lower-court judge's freeze on the ban was too broad.Flentje did offer something of a compromise for the judges Tuesday, saying they could limit the lower-court judge's ruling to foreigners previously admitted to the country who were abroad now or those who wished to travel and return to the United States in the future.If those judges turn down the administration's appeal and the matter moves immediately to the Supreme Court, the argument would be only on the temporary restraining order, and it would require five justices to reverse the lower court's actions.The high court faced a similar issue last term, when a Texas judge imposed a nationwide halt on an executive action from Obama that would have shielded more than 4 million immigrants who were in the country illegally, but who met certain requirements to get work permits.After people were initially detained and deported, demonstrators packed airports to voice their displeasure, and civil liberties and immigration lawyers filed lawsuits across the country. matt.zapotosky@washpost.com robert.barnes@washpost.com John Wagner contributed to this report.",1865706263,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

County executive to veto migrant protection bill,"""The bill offers a false sense of security to undocumented immigrants, compromises public safety efforts and puts us at risk for losing critical federal funding,"" Kittleman said at a late afternoon news conference. [...]proponents said codification of those principles is more important than ever since the election of Trump, whose early executive actions on a southern border wall and a broad travel ban have spawned fear and uncertainty in immigrant communities nationwide Advocates said those fears are keenly felt in Howard, the nation's third-wealthiest county by household income ($108,000, just behind Loudoun and Fairfax counties). Howard Police Chief Gary Gardner opposed the sanctuary label, contending that it could jeopardize federal funding and limit what he called ""critical"" assistance from Immigration and Customs Enforcement on drug and gang cases.

Trump learning that his power is not absolute,"Donald Trump, elected on a promise to bring an unabashedly autocratic leadership style to the presidency, is rapidly learning that even the most powerful job in the world has limits. [...]it was built to be that way. Not since his election-night victory speech has Trump sounded many persuasive or conciliatory notes toward the opposition or seemed to factor in the dead weight of his unpopularity with the majority of the electorate that voted against him. Before Robart suspended it, Trump's immigration order, which sought to ban refugees from Syria indefinitely and halt immigration from six other majority-Muslim countries temporarily, drew an official rebuke from hundreds of State Department employees, who used a ""dissent channel"" to register their views. The vice president's defense of Trump represents a sharp contrast to how Republican leaders treated President Barack Obama, who in his second term ramped up the use of executive actions, saying Congress was hopelessly gridlocked through partisan politics. When Obama moved in November 2014 to unilaterally alter immigration policy by allowing millions of undocumented immigrants the right to apply for work permits, GOP leaders erupted in howls of protest, derisively referring to Obama as an ""emperor"" and an ""imperial president"" attempting to...",1865710491,Newspapers," Tumulty, Karen

Travel ban case opens with sharp questioning; Appellate judges are likely to rule this week on Trump order.,"A federal appeals court panel reviewing President Trump's controversial limits on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries appeared skeptical Tuesday of the administration's arguments seeking to reinstate his order. In a hearing that lasted more than an hour, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to dismiss the administration's arguments that neither the states nor the courts had the authority to challenge the executive order, which seeks to bar travelers from seven countries in the Middle East and North Africa to protect the United States from terrorists. Trump's executive order suspending the admission of new refugees and blocking travelers from countries with possible links to terrorism prompted protests around the world and threw airports into chaos as at least 60,000 foreigners with valid visas saw them suddenly canceled. A federal judge in Seattle last week issued a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the ban, and those potentially affected by it -- students who had been overseas visiting their families, engineers on work visas, relatives hoping to visit their families in the U.S. -- began streaming into the country again. August Flentje, special counsel to the assistant U.S. attorney general, argued that Trump's order merely put a ""temporary pause"" on entry from the seven countries until security concerns could be reviewed. Once the legality of the hold is resolved, the case would return to Robart. -- maura.dolan@latimes.com jaweed.kaleem@latimes.com -- (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX) Judges hearing the appeal These three U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals...",1865711882,Newspapers," Dolan, Maura

[...]we need a president who can connect all of these dots and navigate a path that gets the most out of them and cushions the worst. [...]how would I do that? I'd organize an alliance of Pacific trading nations that surround China and enlist them in a trade pact that supports U.S.-style rule of law, greater market access for U.S. intellectual property and products and promotes U.S. values -- as opposed to China's.

Judges Question Government Case for Travel Ban,"A Justice Department lawyer on Tuesday said courts should not second-guess President Trump's targeted travel ban, drawing skepticism from a three-judge federal appeals panel weighing the limits of executive authority in cases of national security. No matter how the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rules -- in a decision that is expected within days -- an appeal to the United States Supreme Court is likely. A 4-to-4 tie in the Supreme Court would leave the appeals court's ruling in place. The panel was considering an earlier ruling by Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle, which allowed previously barred travelers and immigrants to enter the country. Judge Friedland said that if the executive order violated the Constitution's ban on government establishment of religion, the court could block it completely. The Supreme Court has said that states suing the federal government to defend their interests are entitled to ""special solicitude in our standing analysis."" Correction: February 9, 2017, Thursday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about legal arguments over President Trump's targeted travel ban erroneously attributed comments from a hearing on the issue.",1865713421,Newspapers," Liptak, Adam

Yemenis Tell U.S. It Must Suspend Ground Missions,"Angry at the civilian casualties incurred last month in the first commando raid authorized by President Trump, Yemen has withdrawn permission for the United States to run Special Operations ground missions against suspected terrorist groups in the country, according to American officials. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, denied reports that the purpose of the attack was to capture or kill any specific Qaeda leader. According to American civilian and military officials, the Yemeni ban on operations does not extend to military drone attacks, and does not affect the handful of American military advisers who are providing intelligence support to the Yemenis and forces from the United Arab Emirates. The deadly raid last month, launched from an amphibious assault ship off the Yemeni coast, was the first known American-led ground mission in Yemen since December 2014, when members of SEAL Team 6 stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. ""The use of U.S. soldiers, high civilian casualties and disregard for local tribal and political dynamics,"" the Brussels-based International Crisis Group said in a report released last Thursday, ""plays into AQAP's narrative of defending Muslims against the West and could increase anti-U.S. sentiment and with it AQAP's pool of recruits.""",1865714393,Newspapers," Sanger, David E

CALIFORNIA JOURNAL; 'Out of control': Just how we like it; Trump calls out the Golden State. But the Twitter president may have met his match on social media.,"On Sunday, in an interview that aired before the Super Bowl, Trump told Bill O'Reilly of Fox News that a proposed California law that would prohibit state and local police agencies from helping federal authorities deport immigrants who are here illegally is ""ridiculous. Unprecedented times call for unprecedented tweets. :: The #ProudlyOutOfControl movement is in full swing, all over the state -- in Sacramento, Silicon Valley, Hollywood and even in unexpected places like Roseville, where a town hall meeting called Saturday by Republican U.S. Rep. Tom McClintock grew heated after hundreds of protesters vocally, but nonviolently, denounced McClintock's support for Trump's policies. Silicon Valley, whose leaders had that awkward photo op with Trump in New York before the inauguration, has joined the resistance. Twitter, Google, Apple and Uber are among the nearly 100 big technology companies who also filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the Washington lawsuit against the travel ban. The sheriffs thought that was just hilarious. :: Shortly before I spoke with Schiff, Trump had announced at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. -- headquarters of both the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command -- that ""the very, very dishonest press"" doesn't report terrorist...",1865715925,Newspapers," Abcarian, Robin

LETTERS,"Respect for the courts Re ""White House digs in for travel ban fight,"" Feb. 6 As an attorney who practices in the federal courts, I strongly value our country's federal judicial system, with independent judges who rule on cases and controversies that come before them. If a party, including the president, disagrees with a district court judge's ruling, that party can seek review in an appellate court. In our system of government, we should not abide the country's most powerful executive official demeaning and disparaging the judiciary through personal attacks on a federal judge. Because judges are ethically constrained from responding directly to such conduct, the legal community must speak up and call for President Trump to retract his comments and to refrain from personal attacks on judges in all matters.

"Holder, Dems discuss strategy; Republicans grumble at not getting to query ex-Justice head hired to help resist Trump.","The visit marks the first time the Washington, D.C-based Holder has come to the state capital since he and his firm, Covington &amp; Burling, were hired last month as independent counsel for the Legislature in anticipation of legal and policy battles with the new administration. Democratic lawmakers were circumspect in describing Holder's remarks -- delivered in the morning to state senators on a full-day policy retreat, and at lunch for the Assembly caucus at a downtown Sacramento hotel -- for fear of violating attorney-client privilege. Assembly GOP Leader Chad Mayes (R-Yucca Valley), who previously denounced the hiring as a ""political stunt,"" was rebuffed in a request for his caucus to pose questions to Holder, although his staff did decline an offer to meet with other visiting attorneys. Most of Covington's initial work has been focused on building a strategy around so-called sanctuary cities -- which limit the use of local law enforcement resources in assisting federal immigration authorities -- after the president signed an executive order that threatened to withhold funds from jurisdictions that act to protect those in the country illegally.

Trump's musings often out of step with party's playbook,"Off-the-cuff remarks complicate policymakers' work on shared agenda When President Trump told Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly recently that the rollout of a Republican health-care plan would ""maybe ... take till sometime into next year,"" he contradicted many congressional Republicans who have promised a swift repeal of the Affordable Care Act. During the presidential transition, Republican lawmakers began speaking about their health-care plans in terms of ""universal access"" - a positive-sounding alternative to the universal-coverage aims of the ACA. Ryan and other House leaders have pushed a corporate tax model known as ""border adjustment,"" where companies can deduct the costs of exported goods but not imported goods from their taxable income, as an alternative to the border tariff that Trump has frequently threatened to level on U.S. companies that move production overseas. "" ""Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it,"" he said. ""Because usually it means we're going to get adjusted into a bad deal. Ryan's aides pointed to those comments - as well as remarks that day from Spicer pointing to a plan ""using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from"" - as evidence that...",1866006986,Newspapers," DeBonis, Mike

Sessions wins confirmation after ugly partisan duel,"A sharply divided Senate confirmed President Trump's nominee for attorney general Wednesday, capping an ugly partisan fight and revealing how deep the discord has grown between Republicans and Democrats at the dawn of Trump's presidency. The day after an unusually tense conflict on the Senate floor, the chamber voted 52 to 47 on Wednesday evening to clear Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), whose record on civil and voting rights as a federal prosecutor and state attorney general has long been criticized. Warren unleashed a tweetstorm of displeasure following Sessions's confirmation Wednesday night, saying the new attorney general - and the GOP senators who supported him - will hear from her and ""all of us"" if Sessions makes ""the tiniest attempt"" to bring ""his racism, sexism &amp; bigotry"" to the Justice Department. The flare-up over Warren's remarks began as she attempted to read a statement by Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., in opposition to Sessions's 1986 nomination for a slot as a federal district court judge. Sessions has repeatedly declined to say whether he would recuse himself from an investigation involving Trump associates or possible links to Russia's interference in the presidential election; he said he would seek the recommendations of ethics officials and ""value them significantly"" in making a decision. [...]Trump has urged McConnell to dramatically change Senate rules and ""go nuclear"" if Democrats do not back down from their resistance against his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch. After the Sessions nomination vote,...",1866007363,Newspapers," Sullivan, Sean

Undocumented but undeterred in Trump's capital,"[...]it didn't fit, so she started introducing herself as ""an immigrant student."" There are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country and while many are watching from afar as their fates are decided in the nation's capital, there are others who share streets, sidewalks and Metro trains with the very people making those decisions. During his campaign, Donald Trump vowed to build a wall at the Mexican border, step up deportations of those already in the country, and turn away refugees and immigrants from Muslim countries. Since taking office, he has already started making good on those promises. Among those in Washington who could be affected - and who spoke to The Washington Post despite fears of repercussions - are a chef who worked his way up from a dishwasher, a transgender woman who fears death if she is deported, a laborer who spends his days off at the library, a father of two American-born children and Monroy, who works at a nonprofit organization that helps immigrants and women and who knows what's at stake beyond her own life. Many were accompanied by praise for President Barack Obama, who created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to offer temporary protection to her and more than 700,000 ""dreamers"" who were brought to the United States as children.

Gorsuch calls Trump attacks 'demoralizing',"Judges have drawn president's ire Backers see sign of independence in high court choice President Trump's escalating attacks on the federal judiciary drew denunciation Wednesday from his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, who told a senator that the criticism was ""disheartening"" and ""demoralizing"" to independent federal courts. Trump has been on a days-long crusade against the judicial branch since U.S. District Judge James L. Robart of Seattle halted the administration's executive order temporarily halting the U.S. refugee program and barring entry to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is deliberating whether Trump's executive order should be allowed to stand. Trump's handling of the incident recalled his attacks during the presidential campaign on an American judge of Mexican descent, Gonzalo Curiel, who Trump claimed could not fairly adjudicate a fraud case against now-defunct Trump University because of his ethnic heritage. A coalition of Democratic members of the House introduced a resolution criticizing Trump's attacks, and Laura Brill, a California lawyer and former clerk to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, sent the administration's top lawyers a letter on behalf of nearly 150 lawyers who practice in the federal courts denouncing Trump's comments. ""Lawyers across the political spectrum believe that the president's personal attacks on individual judges and on the judicial branch are improper and destructive,"" Brill said in a statement. ""Because judges face ethical constraints in their ability to respond directly, the letter calls on the president to...",1866008998,Newspapers," Phillip, Abby

"Pay hike draws farm labor; California garlic grower raises wages 18%, to $13 an hour, and sees its shortage of workers disappear.","Human resources frantically advertised open farm-labor positions, posting help-wanted ads online and urging employees to ply their networks for potential recruits. The total supply of farm laborers in Mexico, for which growers in the U.S. compete, declined by 150,000 workers every year between 1980 and 2010, according to a study last year by Diane Charlton and Edward Taylor, researchers at Montana State University and UC Davis. The shortage of workers is one reason farms have cut back production of fruits and vegetables by 9.5%, costing growers $3.1 billion in lost revenue, according to a 2015 report by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a nonprofit that promotes immigration reform.

LETTERS; Harming education,"Re ""Pence breaks tie to confirm DeVos to Education post,"" Feb. 8 It is clear to me after the Senate voted 51-50 (with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie) to confirm Betsy DeVos as secretary of Education that the Republicans care little about honesty or qualifications; this woman has no idea of what education means in this country.

Public schools must take all comers.

Caution urged on terror label for Iranian entity,"Listing the Guard Corps could imperil U.S. troops, White House is told Senior defense and intelligence officials have cautioned the White House that a proposal to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization could endanger U.S. troops in Iraq and the overall fight against the Islamic State, and would be an unprecedented use of a law that was not designed to sanction government institutions. Defense and intelligence concerns have been expressed at the highest levels over the past several days, as the White House was preparing to roll out an executive order dealing with both Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Muslim Brotherhood, according to administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive matter. Asked about the order at Wednesday's White House briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer declined to make a specific comment, saying that ""there is no one who can question the president's commitment to fully attacking and addressing the threat that we face from radical Islamic terrorism. . Designating the Revolutionary Guard - a force of more than 100,000 that fields an army, navy and air force, in addition to wielding significant economic power...",1866017536,Newspapers," DeYoung, Karen

Trump criticized for his personal attacks on judges; Even his Supreme Court nominee rebukes the president for an escalating assault on jurists.,"President Trump has launched an assault on the independence of the judiciary, accusing federal judges of playing politics by suspending his travel ban and suggesting they risk national security by restricting his ability to block visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. The 9th Circuit three-judge panel will decide as soon as Thursday whether to strike down or uphold a lower-court ruling suspending the enforcement of Trump's travel ban. When U.S. District Judge James L. Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush, ruled in favor of the states suing Trump over the order, Washington and Minnesota, he pointed to a 2015 appeals court decision that blocked President Obama's attempt to expand protections from deportation for some people in the U.S. illegally.

Life Along the U.S.-Mexico Border,"Farther east, heavy steel X-frames cut through the flat miles of sun-bleached grass like battlefield markers.In Tijuana, two border fences run the length of the city: one of corrugated metal rusted by time, and another, a few hundred feet away, of dense metal fencing draped in concertina wire. ""Why the hell can't he pay for it himself, then?"" Through deserts, mountains and pastures, the border wall changes from 20-foot metal panels, to sheeting along stretches of sand, to X-shaped barriers on the plains.Though named a Pueblo Magico -- a designation granted by the federal government for its history and charm -- fear lingers on the streets because of increased crime along the border.Residents say armed men and gang members have appeared in the past five years, seizing farmland.Stores have closed, and though the main international crossing stays busy, many residents say movement across the border has slowed because of a turf war between cartels.At the edge of this Texas town of 13,000, the border fence lines the Old Hidalgo Pumphouse, a decommissioned water-irrigation facility that is now a museum and birding center.'

[...]in this case, false information, based on a mistake from a little-known news source, was trumpeted to a vast audience by an American president who is prone to exaggeration and falsehoods, whose immigration policy is under fire, and whose administration has promoted the term ""alternative facts."" Keenly aware of the ""justifiable international public interest,"" the editor quickly wrote and published an article about the Kuwaiti ban without realizing that it was based on ""a decision made in 2011,"" according to a statement posted on the site on Tuesday after The New York Times inquired about the article's origin.

Why Silicon Valley Booed Trump's Immigration Ban,"If you want to understand why tech employees went to the mat against Mr. Trump's executive order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, you need to first understand the crucial role that America's relatively open immigration policies play in the tech business. ""Silicon Valley is unlikely, as a phenomenon -- it is not the default state of the world,"" said John Collison, an immigrant from Ireland who is a co-founder of Stripe, a six-year-old payments start-up based in San Francisco. [...]the tech industry is in thrall to white dudes as much as just about any other business. Critics of the industry's friendliness toward immigrants say it comes down to money -- that technology companies take advantage of visa programs, like the H-1B system, to get foreign workers at lower prices than they would pay American-born ones.

She Met Yearly With Immigration Agents. Now They've Deported Her.,"For eight years, Guadalupe García de Rayos had checked in at the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement office here, a requirement since she was caught using a fake Social Security number during a raid in 2008 at a water park where she worked. ""ICE will continue to focus on identifying and removing individuals with felony convictions who have final orders of removal issued by the nation's immigration courts."" Lawyers from two of the nation's leading civil rights' groups said Ms. Rayos might be the first unauthorized immigrant to be arrested during a scheduled meeting with immigration officials since Mr. Trump took office. Ms. Rayos was working at Golfland Sunsplash in Mesa, a suburb of Phoenix, when Maricopa County sheriff's deputies swooped in on Dec. 16, 2008, arresting her and several other employees on charges of suspicion of identity theft and using forged documents to obtain employment. The raid was one of the first ordered by Joe Arpaio, who was sheriff at the time, under an Arizona law authorizing sanctions against employers who knowingly hired undocumented immigrants.",1866475090,Newspapers," Santos, Fernanda

When the Fire Comes,"What will you do when terrorists attack, or U.S. friction with some foreign power turns into a military confrontation? I don't mean in your personal life, where you should keep calm and carry on. Doubts about the legitimacy of a president who lost the popular vote and was installed by a bare majority on the Supreme Court were swept aside. The Bush administration exploited the post-9/11 rush of patriotism to take America into an unrelated war, then used the initial illusion of success in that war to ram through huge tax cuts for the wealthy. For one thing, until now it would have been inconceivable that a sitting president would attack a private company for decisions that hurt his family's business interests. [...]maybe, just maybe, there are enough Republican senators who really do care about America's fundamental values to cross party lines in their defense.

"Talk About Trade and Defense, and a Little Golf","Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, the first world leader to meet Donald J. Trump after the election in November, plans to meet with the president in Washington on Friday in the Oval Office. With Mr. Trump warning Toyota of a ""big border tax"" on the company if it built a new plant in Mexico and telling American business leaders that Japan purposely devaluates the yen for economic advantage, Mr. Abe is concerned about how Mr. Trump's ""America First"" policies could affect Japanese companies and the country's broader economy. According to the Japan Business Federation, Japanese companies have directly invested more than $400 billion in building factories and other facilities in the United States, creating about 1.7 million jobs for American workers. Other companies, including Sharp and Fuji Heavy Industries, have also recently talked publicly about existing plans to expand or build new factories in the United States, while Nisshinbo...",1866475905,Newspapers," Rich, Motoko

Senate Successor to Sessions Has Deep Ties to Republican Establishment,"More than any other elected official, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama laid the intellectual foundation for President Trump's brand of nationalist politics, agitating for a hard line on immigration and trade while most other Republicans were in thrall to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Trump was still firing contestants on ""The Apprentice."" Mr. Sessions, who was sworn in as attorney general on Thursday, was succeeded on the same day in the Senate by the attorney general of Alabama, Luther Strange, a former Washington lobbyist and onetime partner at a white-shoe Birmingham law firm with deep ties to the establishment wing of the Republican Party. A Birmingham native reared in the city's comfortable suburbs, Mr. Strange eventually made his way home from Washington and became a partner at a powerhouse law firm that represents many of Alabama's muscular corporate interests. (Mr. Strange appointed an acting attorney general to oversee the investigation and trial.) But by the time Mr. Hubbard was found guilty in June, Gov. Robert Bentley, who appointed Mr. Strange to his Senate seat, was embroiled in his own controversy after a recording of a sexually charged conversation with a top aide became public.",1866477097,Newspapers," Martin, Jonathan

"THE WORLD; How will Trump's wall work? 'Ask Israel'; President borrows a controversial tactic, worrying experts and human rights groups.","Palestinian security forces now work more closely, if secretly, with Israeli security forces, and Palestinian intifadas, or uprisings, tend to have their own dynamic. [...]the wall has inflamed tension and resentment among Palestinians. A report this month by the Republican leadership of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security praised Israel's security efforts in glowing terms. The report, ""Securing Israel: Lessons Learned from a Nation Under Constant Threat of Attack,"" credits Israel's extensive building of fences and walls along its internal and external borders for the decline in terrorist attacks. ""Israel's swift and effective border security measures provide lessons for the United States and other countries seeking to protect their citizens,"" says the report, which came out of a trip to Israel by the committee's chairman, Sen.

Science entering a new frontier: Politics; Outrage at Trump's positions mobilizes scientists into action.,"Instead of focusing on earthly concerns, the UC Berkeley radio astronomer spent most of his time scanning the outer reaches of the cosmos, searching for the earliest stars in the universe.[...]he watched with increasing despair when Trump's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, said at his Senate committee hearing that there is no clear scientific consensus that global warming is caused by human activity.[...]he sent an open letter to Trump explaining the widespread consensus among experts that human-caused climate change is real and that its consequences are already being felt.Spurred by a flurry of executive orders and presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway's references to ""alternative facts,"" certain researchers are venturing beyond the safety of the lab and into the murky political fray.Researchers have spoken out against new restrictions on how government scientists at the EPA and other federal agencies communicate with the public.Perhaps the biggest outcry came after the White House announced that travelers from seven primarily Muslim countries would be blocked from entering the United States.[...]Sudanese-born Mohamed H.A. Hassan, co-leader of a group of scientific academies from around the world, has said he won't travel from Europe to attend the AAAS annual meeting in Boston next week.Bill Foster, a physicist-turned-congressman from Illinois, said the political awakening among researchers is not solely a consequence of the rapid series of executive orders coming from the Oval Office.",1867397178,Newspapers," Netburn, Deborah

COUNTDOWN TO THE GRAMMYS; Raising their voices for the ACA; This year the music world is spotlighting protection of the healthcare law.,"Veteran artists like Tony Bennett, Bonnie Raitt and Merry Clayton (of the Oscar-winning documentary ""20 Feet From Stardom"") entered the national debate by supporting the Affordable Care Act and MusiCares' efforts to bolster it. (MusiCares and the Jazz Foundation installed a chairlift in Clayton's home after both her legs were amputated following a car accident.) ""As an industry insider, I know that they really do help thousands of music people each year,"" said Neil Diamond, a longtime MusiCares supporter. In an awards season marked by political activism -- at the Golden Globes, Meryl Streep lectured President Trump on civility, SAG award winners denounced Trump's travel ban -- no effort has been as personal as the music community's efforts to put the pre-Grammys spotlight on healthcare. According to Neil Portnow, the president of the Recording Academy, the ACA transformed the lives of thousands of music professionals, many of whom may work steadily but without a consistent salary, much less health benefits. Mindee Jorgensen, the drummer for several touring indie-punk bands such as Peach Kelli Pop, says she had to limit her income to stay on government assistance to afford treatment for bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.
