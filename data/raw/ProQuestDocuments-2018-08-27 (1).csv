Co-organized by Michelle Yun, senior curator of Modern and contemporary art at Asia Society, and at Colby College Museum (where the show opens in February 2017) by Colby College's Melissa Walt and Ankeney Weitz, this is the first Zao retrospective in the U.S. But, judging by the best pictures shown in the exhibition catalog, it is not definitive.",1820989446,Newspapers," Esplund, Lance

Donald 'Wrong Way' Trump,"  Mr. Trump insists that the U.S. Treasury designate China a currency manipulator -- meaning that Beijing is intervening in foreign-exchange markets to keep the yuan undervalued. The wrong way to deal with globalization is the Trump way: close the borders, renege on trade agreements, erect tariff barriers and try to get back to the 1950s -- a time when U.S. manufacturing dominated a world still recovering from World War II, when foreign competition could be ignored and when information traveled at a fraction of today's speeds.

Here's a case study.","  When Trump said that, it shocked many conservative commentators and intellectuals, including the Weekly Standard's Jonathan Last : Nine months ago, if you had asked Sarah Palin, Scott Brown, Jerry Falwell Jr., or Ann Coulter whether they would endorse a figure who takes the Code Pink, Michael Moore, MoveOn.org view of Iraq (""Bush lied, people died""), one suspects they all would have recoiled at the prospect. Whatever your views on the wisdom of Iraq, no serious person believes that Bush masterminded a massive fraud, with the help of his cabinet and the entire national security apparatus; that his ""lies"" then managed to fool the governments and intelligence agencies of a dozen allies; and that, somehow, none of the evidence of this scheme ever managed to leak into the open.",1823941975,Newspapers," Taranto, James

While those in the show who were influenced by Grosz (1893-1959) include William Gropper, Leon Golub, Diego Rivera, Martha Rosler, Faith Ringgold and Gerhard Richter--more than 20 artists in all--the examples from this historically and nationally diverse group are minor to the point of mere memorabilia, with the one notable exception being the inimitable Peter Saul's 2006 painting of Hitler's brain flying out of a toilet.",1826788153,Newspapers," Plagens, Peter

Best poetry of the month: New collections by Billy Collins and Robert Pinsky (Posted 2016-10-11 17:32:27),"  The work also shows a variety of styles, moving from longer meditations to short, tight poems, and from ironic, almost biting moments to descriptions that are evocative and lovely, as in the opening lines of ""Many Moons"": ""The thinnest of slivers can come/ as a surprise some nights./ A girl leaving a restaurant/ points up to show her friends./ And there is the full one,/ bloated with light/ a bright circle over the city/ keeping the dreamers from sleep.""",1827837919,Newspapers," Lund, Elizabeth

Why we shouldn't forgive the Republicans who sold their souls (Posted 2016-10-11 14:00:22),"  After years of railing against the Obama administration's ""reset,"" the leading Republican spokesmen on this issue said little and did nothing when their own nominee spoke admiringly of Russian President Vladi mir Putin and when his closest advisers were discovered to be intimately connected to the Kremlin and found to be lobbyists for Putin's puppets in Ukraine or Gazprom's pipeline plans. Given the Republican track record, and not only in this election but in recent years -- on Syria, for instance, where leading presidential hopefuls opposed the use of force at a critical moment; or on defense spending, where Republican majorities in both houses have allowed the sequester to stand -- the contrast is not as clear as it once was. [...]as it happens, the present Democratic candidate is as solid on matters of national security as almost any Republican, and infinitely more so than the present Republican nominee -- which is one reason so many Republican national-security officials have either come out against Trump or have outright endorsed Clinton.",1827838523,Newspapers," Kagan, Robert

Don't forgive the GOP,"  After years of railing against the Obama administration's ""reset,"" the leading Republican spokesmen on this issue said little and did nothing when their own nominee spoke admiringly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and when his closest advisers were discovered to be intimately connected to the Kremlin and found to be lobbyists for Putin's puppets in Ukraine or Gazprom's pipeline plans. Given the Republican track record, and not only in this election but in recent years - on Syria, for instance, where leading presidential hopefuls opposed the use of force at a critical moment; or on defense spending, where Republican majorities in both houses have allowed the sequester to stand - the contrast is not as clear as it once was. [...]as it happens, the present Democratic candidate is as solid on matters of national security as almost any Republican, and infinitely more so than the present Republican nominee - which is one reason so many Republican national-security officials have either come out against Trump or have outright endorsed Clinton.",1828074708,Newspapers," Kagan, Robert

The speech bore the imprint of Stephen K. Bannon, the Trump campaign's chief executive, who until recently was the executive chairman of Breitbart, a conservative website that serves as the virtual town square of the alt-right movement.",1828689090,Newspapers," Rucker, Philip

Ms. Lewis, who turned 18 in July, was essentially raised by Ms. Washington and accompanied her twice-annual pilgrimages to the local polling stations in their small town of Mizpah, N.J.

"Turning Points: Where the Election Is Child-Friendly --- Taking a child to the polls to vote can instill values and lessons, parents hope; resonating more this year","  The physical acts involved in voting -- getting into a car, or subway, walking several blocks to the polling place, waiting in line with others, marking your ballots and pulling the lever -- are memorable and underscore the day's significance, says Rabbi Steven Carr Reuben, author of ""Children of Character."" Ms. Lewis, who turned 18 in July, was essentially raised by Ms. Washington and accompanied her twice-annual pilgrimages to the local polling stations in their small town of Mizpah, N.J. Her great-grandmother would take her behind the curtain, let her press the buttons, and let her sit with her as she registered voters.",1829982295,Newspapers," Ansberry, Clare

In court filings, federal officials have argued that Mr. Ahmed is trying to prolong his Indian case to delay his return to the U.S. Earlier this year, the SEC dug up a newly created LinkedIn profile identifying Mr. Ahmed only as ""Ifty A.A."" and listing his job as chief of staff at a ""sports village.""",1834190351,Newspapers," Das, Anupreeta
