Other critics, while less hyperbolic, note the new arrivals often cost the government money in the form of food stamps, cash assistance and Medicaid benefits, as many begin new lives here below the poverty line. Long a jumping-off point for immigrants, the neighborhood has more than 500 previously empty homes occupied by refugee families, according to State Assemblyman Sean Ryan, a Democrat who represents the area. The West Side Bazaar, ""an international small-business incubator"" teeming with food stands, does a healthy business, as does a local grocery offering fruits, vegetables and ""worldwide money transfer."" Groups say donations and volunteerism are up.) Eva M. Hassett, the executive director of the International Institute of Buffalo, another resettlement agency, says she fears that the changes proposed by the new administration would imperil the city's longstanding reputation for welcoming newcomers, something that dates back to waves of Italian, Irish and Eastern European immigrants who followed the trains and canals west in the 19th and 20th centuries. Mohsen Daghooghi, an Iranian postdoctoral fellow researching computational fluid mechanics at the University at Buffalo, found himself suddenly separated from his wife and 6-month-old son when they were recently denied re-entry to the United States after a trip to visit family in Iran.

Right-wing news media in the United States and elsewhere have insisted that Sweden is covering up evidence of migrant-related crime -- a claim officials in this prosperous Scandinavian nation, which has a long humanitarian tradition, have rejected. Lars Bystrom, a police spokesman, said the police were summoned at 8:18 p.m. on Monday to the transit station in Rinkeby, about seven miles northwest of Stockholm's City Hall, after officers made a drug-related arrest and were set upon by residents. Asked whether there was enough of a police presence in Rinkeby, Mr. Bystrom cited the district police chief, Niklas Andersson, in describing police resources in the area as plentiful. Benjamin Dousa, 24, an appointed member of a local board in Rinkeby that distributes public money for schools, social services, parks and recreation, and elder care, wrote in an opinion essay that Mr. Trump's critique had some merit.

With the new guidelines, Trump took a significant step closer to realizing his and top aides' vision for reducing the immigrant population in the U.S. Though Kelly emphasized that immigration officers should focus first on deporting convicted criminals or those charged with crimes, his directives nonetheless unleashed deportation officers to conduct more raids in immigrant communities, detain people who don't have criminal convictions and remove people for minor infractions such as driving without a license. ""No matter how much they deny it, it is clear that the White House is setting in motion their mass deportation plan, directing immigration agents to round up and quickly deport anyone who is undocumented,"" Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

The use of the tactic, critics said, is particularly egregious in heavily immigrant cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, where police and elected officials have tried for decades to distinguish their cops from federal immigration agents in an effort to convince immigrants living illegally in their cities that they can interact with local police without fear of deportation. ""There is something fundamentally unfair about ICE exploiting local and state policies that are trying to improve public safety by promoting immigrants' trust in law enforcement,"" said Frances Miriam Kreimer, senior attorney at Dolores Street Community Services in San Francisco. In one case, ICE agents in Los Angeles identified themselves as police detectives to the mother of Luis Enrique Cruz Estrada, saying her son had information regarding the whereabouts of a person they wanted to find, according to attorney Jennie Pasquarella, director of immigrants' rights for the American Civil Liberties Union of California.

While Mr. Trump assailed Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign for her connections to Brunei, he explored opportunities in the country, taking out a trademark covering several categories used for real estate projects, the review showed. Foreign entanglements led a group of former White House ethics lawyers and constitutional scholars to file suit, charging that Mr. Trump is violating the Constitution by allowing his businesses to receive payments from foreign governments. During the campaign, he assailed Mrs. Clinton and her family foundation for taking donations from Brunei, whose government, he said, ""has pushed oppressive Shariah law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay.""

Tom McClintock's town hall. [...]about a third or so of the crowd appeared strongly supportive of the president.) For Rep. Buddy Carter, a two-term GOP lawmaker representing a staunchly conservative stretch of coastal Georgia, the boos began as soon as he tried to present plans to replace the current healthcare law. More than 300 people, many wearing Planned Parenthood T-shirts and waving pink and purple paper hearts, squeezed into a college auditorium in Savannah for the standing-room-only event. An earlier round of town halls this month produced a number of screaming spectacles, prompting many Republican lawmakers to scrub their latest recess schedules of any such face-to-face encounters. Some skittish GOP lawmakers skipped meeting with constituents altogether; in California, the liberal group Indivisible circulated milk cartons bearing the word ""Missing"" and the face of Republican Rep. Paul Cook, a three-term congressman from the southeastern desert. Jennifer Bruns, 49, joined her husband and their two teenage sons at Democratic Rep.

After Trump was elected in November, an unease settled into immigrant communities around California and the United States as those here illegally awaited word on the president's promise of a deportation crackdown. Officials on Tuesday swept aside nearly all restrictions on the removal of 11 million people in the U.S. illegally, a vast expansion of the federal government's deportation priorities. Trump supporters and others applaud his administration's measures, arguing that immigrants here illegally are a drain on the economy and take jobs away from citizens. Families made up of both legal and illegal residents have begun talking about having a plan of action if some members of the family are deported. New York officials complain that immigration agents are staking out the courts, looking for those who can be detained.

Part of the issue is that Mr. Trump wants local police officers to act as immigration agents, threatening to withhold federal funding from those departments that do not cooperate. Last month, the International Association of Chiefs of Police issued a statement saying that it would ""strongly oppose any initiative that would mandate that state and local law enforcement agencies play a role in the enforcement of federal immigration law."" Law enforcement officials say that not every MS-13 member is an undocumented immigrant, but that the gang recruits from a base of unaccompanied Central American minors who entered the country illegally. Since Sept. 13, the police in Suffolk County have arrested more than 90 MS-13 members, with many in federal custody as officials gather evidence to charge them under organized crime law. According to census statistics through 2014, 58,426 Salvadorans live in Suffolk County, and nearly one-third live in Brentwood. Ms. Rodriguez, who lost her daughter to gang violence, attributed the rise of gang activity to what she sees as the Brentwood School District's lackadaisical policies for monitoring students and responding to threats, including those she reported on behalf of Kayla.

Stuck in a gray zone outside the legal system, they are vulnerable to exploitation, including wage theft and sex trafficking. Because they are denied formal protections or services, informal alternatives take their place -- creating an ideal space for corruption, gangs and other forms of criminality. [...]they could increase the burdens on undocumented migrants and, more broadly, on society. While cities often tolerate these illegal settlements -- their residents help drive the economy -- there is always a chance that slums can be cleared. [...]a quarter billion urban workers are registered as rural, cutting them off from basic services like health care in the cities where they live. Under what is known as the kafala system, a gulf state employer can unilaterally dictate the legal and immigration status of unskilled foreign migrants who work jobs like construction and housekeeping, putting those workers at the whims of employers. Economic conditions attract workers, but their illegal status prevents the state from either protecting them or ensuring that their labor is regulated and taxed in a way that fairly benefits everyone. The changes also face political resistance because they touch on difficult questions of national identity in countries where foreign workers outnumber citizens.",1871364355,Newspapers," Taub, AmandaAmandaAmanda TaubTaubAmanda Taub , Fisher, MaxMaxMax FisherFisherMax Fisher",," Copyright New York Times Company Feb 24, 2017"," 503703-20170224 , 503703-20170224 , 7818 , PQ_7818_Feb242017", News," Feb 24, 2017",0362-4331, English, English, A.18," New York, N.Y.","Feb 24, 2017",New York Times,2017,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1871364355?accountid=14496,, A.18," Immigration policy , Deportation , Corruption , Ghettos , Migrant workers , Criminal investigations , Aliens , Poverty , Human trafficking , United States--US , India , China , Persian Gulf states",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=What+Can+Happen+When+Migrants+Are+Pushed+Into+the+Shadows%3A+%5BNational+Desk%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2017-02-24&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.18&amp;au=Taub%2C+Amanda%3BFisher%2C+Max&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,New York TimesSubway Ridership Drops for First Time Since 2009,"After a period of soaring subway demand in New York City, ridership dropped last year, and transit officials say the rise of Uber and other car service apps may be partly to blame.

When the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency wants to deport one of his inmates, the jail sends a fax notifying ICE before the inmate is about to walk free -- leaving it to federal agents to show up and make an arrest. Officials at the jail, which releases about 100 people a day and receives three to five detainer requests a week, say they try their best to cooperate with immigration officials and to notify them in a timely manner, despite calls from local advocates not to communicate with the agency and to release undocumented immigrants through a side door to elude federal agents.

While their numbers are a small fraction of the world's migratory population, and of the world's millionaires, wealthy people are being courted and cosseted by host countries like never before. According to New World Wealth, a market research firm based in Johannesburg, South Africa, the number of millionaires moving to another country jumped 28 percent in 2016 from the previous year, reaching the highest level the firm has found in its four years of measuring. Mr. Amoils said Australia was especially attractive to Chinese millionaires, given its relative proximity, its wide choice of private schools, its clean environment and its political and economic stability. In 2012, the country introduced a ""golden-ticket"" investor visa program that fast-tracks and eases the residency requirement for a permanent visa. Millionaires need to invest 5 million Australian dollars (about $3.8 million) to qualify for the program, officially called the Special Investor Visa. Since its creation, more than 1,300 foreigners, nearly 90 percent of them from China, have used the program, according to government statistics.

With just over six months until the Democratic primary, no credible challenger -- a person with some combination of name recognition, a political base, governmental experience and the funding to wage a knockdown campaign -- has emerged. There is another side of the ledger to consider, political observers said, that has so far warded off serious contenders in the Democratic primary -- often the deciding contest in a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans six to one.

By now, the well-documented abuses of the H-1B program, such as the Disney workers who had to train their foreign-born replacements, should have obliterated the notion that immigration does not harm competing native workers. Over the past 30 years, a large fraction of immigrants, nearly a third, were high school dropouts, so the incumbent low-skill work force formed the core group of Americans who paid the price for the influx of millions of workers. On a year-to-year basis, immigrant families, mostly because of their relatively low incomes and higher frequency of participating in government programs like subsidized health care, are a fiscal burden.

In particular, Ms. Sheive and her lawyers allege that the slam -- which is held on the last Saturday of February during squirrel-hunting season -- is particularly damaging to the arboreal rodents because the key to winning the one-day contest is to bag the heaviest squirrels; that is, those that might be pregnant. ""Since it is baby time, the moms will be fatter and larger,"" according to an affidavit submitted by Ms. Sheive, who lives in Williamson, N.Y., east of Rochester. [...]if, as could happen, there is an overkilling of females who are potentially leaving young to die in their nests, what does that do to the balance of nature?"" State environmental officials dispute that assertion, saying the hunt falls outside of the period in which squirrels breed and care for their young. Supporters of the slam have long been bewildered by the accusation that they are somehow upsetting the area's ecology, saying the event is merely a fun way to raise money and promote community bonding.

Inside the West Wing, the two men have pushed an ominous view of refugee and immigration flows, telling other policymakers that if large numbers of Muslims are allowed to enter the U.S., parts of American cities will begin to replicate marginalized immigrant neighborhoods in France, Germany and Belgium that have been home to plotters of terrorist attacks in recent years, according to a White House aide familiar with the discussions.

At Sterling Technologies, Inc., a plastics-molding company outside Erie that makes rain barrels and composters, about a quarter of the 160 workers are refugees.

Whether the menace is defined as Islam, immigration or globalization, her vow to voters is the same: I am the woman to preserve the French way of life. Losing the ancient French provincial capital is another blow to Frenchness -- tangible evidence of a disappearing way of life that resonates in France in the same way that the hollowing out of main streets did in the United States decades ago. Down another street is the last toy store, now closed, and around a corner is the last independent grocery store, also shuttered. In these old towns, many harder hit than Albi, the interplay of the human-scale architecture, weathered stone and brick, and public life had been one of the crucibles of French history and culture for centuries. With a degree in history and studies in geography, Mr. Jourdain published an online map, with a skull-and-crossbones marking each vacant store. The rise of the shopping centers traced the sharp rise in living standards brought on by what the French call the Trentes Glorieuses, the 30 glorious years from 1945 to 1975. Today, France has the highest density of such retail space in all of Europe, even as vacancies in 190 historic town centers have gone to 10.4 percent in 2015 from 6.1 percent in 2001, according to the government report.

ELECTIONS | MARCH 7; Possible 'turning point' in black political clout; Two Latinos challenge incumbent as South L.A. voter base shifts.,"Against this backdrop, two candidates with deep community ties are challenging incumbent City Councilman Curren Price in next week's election, both seeking to become the area's first Latino council member in decades. Two other council districts are represented by African Americans, and a loss for Price could be a bellwether for future South L.A. council elections amid a falling black population citywide, said political consultant and attorney Dermot Givens. [...]that power base did not translate into electoral success for Isadore Hall, a former state senator and Compton City Council member who ran last year for the southern L.A. County congressional seat vacated by Janice Hahn, now a county supervisor. In Los Angeles, Price, a 66-year-old former state senator and Inglewood City Council member, hopes to hold on to the City Council seat he won in 2013, when he defeated Ana Cubas in a runoff. Since taking office, he's launched an alley cleanup program and worked on citywide initiatives aimed at helping working-class residents, including a paid sick-leave bill, protections for job seekers with criminal histories and decriminalization of street vending. In what some viewed as an election-timed gesture aimed at Mexican and Central American voters, Price joined immigration groups last week at City Hall to announce a $1-million donation to aid immigrants at risk of deportation under Trump. Alberto Retana, president of Community Coalition, a South Los Angeles nonprofit, praised the councilman's record on immigration efforts, citing his work to raise the city's minimum wage and protect street vendors.

Global realities such as automation, the spread of technology and the endless corporate quest for cheap labor are powerful forces, and pulling back on trade could hurt more than help. Not only do low-skilled immigrants tend to go after different jobs than natives do, but to the extent there's overlap in the manual labor pool, the presence of immigrants drives native-born workers into higher-paying jobs where they have the competitive advantage of citizenship and language skills.

Created in 1967, the merit-based system was seen as a way to select immigrants based on their ""human capital"" and not simply their country of origin, as had been the tradition. Candidates received points for their level of education, ability to speak one or both of the country's official languages, work experience, age, a job offer and what immigration officials called adaptability, which meant they came with family or had family here. The formula has changed over the years, with points for training and job categories rising or falling as officials' ideas on job readiness changed. [...]recently, admission was based on acquiring at least 67 points, with up to 70 given for advanced education, fluency in English and French, and four or more years of work experience. After Prime Minister Justin Trudeau entered office later in 2015, his Liberal government rejiggered the formula again, greatly reducing the number of points awarded for a job offer and adding 30 points for candidates who had graduated, as foreign students, from a Canadian university.

In a 2015 study, Sarah Gaither, an assistant professor at Duke, found that when she reminded multiracial participants of their mixed heritage, they scored higher in a series of word association games and other tests that measure creative problem solving. Various studies find that business people who live in other countries are more successful than those who stay put; that artists who've lived abroad create more valuable art; that scientists working abroad produce studies that are more highly cited. The point is that diversity -- of one's own makeup, one's experience, of groups of people solving problems, of cities and nations -- is linked to economic prosperity, greater scientific prowess and a fairer judicial process. Harvard and Tel Aviv University scientists ran experiments on white Americans, Israelis and Asian-Americans in which they had some subjects read essays that made an essentialist argument about race, and then asked them to solve word-association games and other puzzles. [...]it's tempting to speculate that the administration's problems so far, including its clumsy rollout of a travel ban that was mostly blocked by the courts, stem in part important, compared with those with same-race roommates.

Ride-hailing apps, like Uber and Lyft, are rapidly transforming transportation in New York, emerging as an existential threat to the taxi industry and siphoning passengers away from subways and buses, while raising concerns over worsening street congestion. [...]came the news that subway ridership had dropped for the first time since 2009, even though the city's population and the number of jobs keep increasing. The price of a car pool ride with the apps can be as low as $5 -- a fee that for many seems worth it when the alternative is spending $2.75 to use a century-old subway system plagued by rising delays. Subway service must become more competitive because it is unsustainable for the city to grow by adding more vehicles, said Bruce Schaller, a former senior transportation official for the city who prepared the report on ride-hailing services.

(The Trump administration has pledged to pressure all 23 into doing so.) They tend to be younger -- the Pew Research Center has found that adult unauthorized immigrants were, at the median, about a decade younger than American-born adults -- and skew slightly more male than the rest of the country. TO HEAR MANY LIBERALS and immigrant advocates tell it, most undocumented immigrants are productive, law-abiding members of society, deeply rooted in communities, working hard, living quietly, paying taxes and raising families. (The proportion of felons in the overall population was 6 percent in 2010, according to a paper presented to the Population Association of America.) Immigration agents regularly arrest what the government calls ""criminal aliens."" At the end of January, agents arrested a 50- year-old Mexican man near Milwaukee who had felony convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, battery against a police officer, car theft and intentionally harming a child, and who had been deported twice before. The Trump administration has said it will continue to prioritize deporting those with serious criminal records, but, in a break with the Obama administration, the new policies also take aim at immigrants whose offenses are limited to living here without permission or minor crimes that enable immigrants to work here, like driving without a license or using a fake Social...",1874619589,Newspapers," Yee, VivianVivianVivian YeeYeeVivian Yee , Davis, KenanKenanKenan DavisDavisKenan Davis , Patel, Jugal KJugalJugal K PatelPatelKJugal K.

When the Department of Homeland Security announced it would make it easier for immigration agents to arrest and deport those living in the country illegally, stories spread at Centro Islamico of traffic checkpoints and raids at grocery stores.

At a time when voters worldwide are rejecting established leaders and turning to populists who promise aggressive solutions for their economic frustrations, Mr. Modi is sensing the mood and increasingly positioning himself as a populist strongman. By the final days of the campaign, the Congress Party leader, Rahul Gandhi, was giving listless speeches to bored crowds -- barely 5,000 showed up at one I attended in the town of Pindra -- focused on trying to pop Mr. Modi's growing personality cult.

Like Sarah Barber, many of them appear to be trading some independence for the chance to turn what otherwise would have been rent money into savings for a down payment. Prices are stable or rising slowly in most other Canadian cities, but Toronto is booming, fueled by rapid population growth, and builders cannot hope to meet all the demand. Dana Senagama, the principal market analyst for the Toronto area at the Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation, a federal agency, said experts were just as taken aback by the price explosion as the general public. Murtaza Haider, a professor of real estate management at Ryerson University in Toronto who specializes in data analysis, said the large number of adults still living with parents was an important factor. Some of that comes from social traditions among certain immigrant groups, but Professor Haider and others say the trend is driven more by high house prices and an increasingly unstable job market for young adults. Like the Barbers, Ms. Nassar's parents said they were delighted to have their daughter at home, and did not mind staying on the sidelines of the real estate market.

The British prime minister has made it clear she wants a clean break, pulling out of the EU's common market and reasserting British control over immigration.

Orange County's Little Saigon bustles with colorful shopping centers and a seemingly endless supply of eateries that draw foodies from around the region. A study by Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the Orange County Asian Pacific Islander Community Alliance found that 57,000 Asian Americans across the county lived below the poverty line, a situation made worse by its notoriously high housing prices. In a community that values real estate as the most coveted sign of success, some Vietnamese Americans are investing in older homes in or near Garden Grove, Fountain Valley, Santa Ana and Westminster and remodeling them into these room rentals. Homeowner Khoi Nguyen, 42, offered the best bedroom in his Garden Grove house to renters, trying to screen applicants by age and their mannerisms. The homes that provide the rooms ring the Little Saigon district, becoming havens for all manner of people: foreign students and cafe singers; traveling salesmen and nostalgic military veterans. When they upgraded to a single-family home just a short walk from the hundreds of mom-and-pop stores and restaurants in Little Saigon -- the largest cultural and commercial district for Vietnamese Americans outside of Vietnam -- they knew they would advertise for tenants.

The report, ""Room to Rise: The Lasting Impact of Intensive Teen Programs in Art Museums,"" highlights programs that generally run from one to three years and serve a dozen to two dozen teenagers annually, who usually come to the museum weekly. When such programs started, they were largely for low-income and minority students, said Mary Ellen Munley, the lead researcher on the report, but ""that has expanded more to get a full circle of diversity.""

The Hague also has to reconcile its generous welfare state and its problematic demographics; balance its national economic interests against a European Union increasingly out of step with the Dutch sense of hard work and prudence; and yes, manage a large and poorly assimilated immigrant population. How can any Dutch voter think her vote can affect policies on these matters when she's governed by someone who barely won one-fifth of parliamentary seats, in cahoots with a clutch of other losing parties betraying the principles they sold to their supporters?

(William Wallace, Scotland's most celebrated freedom fighter, who was born just outside Paisley and hanged, drawn and quartered by King Edward I of England in 1305, is a clear favorite; followed by Mary Stuart, beheaded by Queen Elizabeth three centuries later.) On the second floor of Paisley Museum, Dan Coughlan, the curator for textiles, is more skeptical about secession. Leafing through an 18th-century pattern book, Mr. Coughlan told the story of how Paisley had benefited from the 1707 union with England, which gave its weavers and cotton mills access to foreign markets, ideas and technology and made it one of the most productive towns in the British Empire. A 19th-century prime minister, Benjamin Disraeli, once wrote in a novel, ""Keep your eye on Paisley."" The radical weavers that Disraeli warned about are still celebrated every July in the Sma' Shot festival, where residents pound a drum and burn an effigy of a factory owner (last year's bore a striking resemblance to Nigel Farage, then leader of the pro-Brexit, anti-immigrant U.K. Independence Party, which has failed to win a single seat in Scotland).

ICE has made arrests in courthouses before, but the tactic drew rebukes in California after a series of raids led to the capture of women seeking restraining orders, people paying parking tickets and even one couple getting married inside a Kern County courthouse in 2013, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Last week, Denver City Atty. Kristin Bronson also told several media outlets that she had to dismiss prosecutions against four domestic violence suspects because the complaining witnesses, all of whom are in the country illegally, were afraid ICE might learn their location through a court docket or send agents to the courthouse when they appeared to testify. Some law enforcement leaders in California and throughout the country have repeatedly expressed concern that Trump's promise to dramatically expand immigration enforcement will erode trust between minority communities and local police departments, a bond already weakened by years of scrutiny over officers' use of force throughout the country. ICE faced renewed scrutiny last month after the agency released a video showing immigration agents identifying themselves as police, a tactic decried by activists as unethical and police leaders as detrimental to local law enforcement's relationship with immigrant communities.",1878075957,Newspapers," Queally, JamesJamesJames QueallyQueallyJames Queally",," Copyright Los Angeles Times Mar 17, 2017"," 7683 , PQ_7683_Mar172017 , LATMLATM201703176584 , LATMLATM201703176584", News," Mar 17, 2017",0458-3035, English, English, A.1," Los Angeles, Calif.","Mar 17, 2017",Los Angeles Times,2017,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1878075957?accountid=14496,, A.1," Immigration policy , Deportation , Activists , Law enforcement , Public safety , Restraining orders , Convictions , Women , Sex crimes , Courthouses , Aliens , Texas , John F.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday that the administration would ""appeal the flawed rulings"" and focus its initial challenge on the Maryland case in the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va. Judges appointed by Democratic presidents outnumber Republican appointees on both the 9th and 4th circuit courts, but depending on luck of the draw, the three-judge panels that resolve cases in either circuit could include either conservative or liberal judges.

Douglas Kmiec, a Pepperdine University law professor who was a Justice Department official in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, said Trump must be careful to not appear that he is pushing for Gorsuch's confirmation in order to tip the court to his side on the travel ban.

The annual event is part of a packed day that includes breakfast with the Irish-American vice president, lunch with the Irish-American speaker of the House and -- perhaps -- a few drinks. A Shift to the Right Irish-Americans were staunch Democrats for much of the 20th century, backing the New Deal, venerating the Kennedys and supporting President Bill Clinton's efforts to negotiate peace in Northern Ireland, said Timothy J. Meagher, a historian at the Catholic University of America. Many Catholics opposed abortion and gay marriage; some upwardly mobile Irish-Americans wanted lower taxes; those who were struggling financially were often part of a broader white working-class estrangement from the Democratic Party, in which anxieties about race and immigration played a role.

More than 50 years of work toward cleaner motor vehicles will not be cast aside to satisfy this administration's predilection for corporate profit over the health and welfare of the people who make those corporations so profitable.

The larger inflows from Asia's growing affluent class partly explains the increase in immigrants' education and skill levels -- and that trend is likely to continue even without converting to a merit-based system, which Giovanni Peri, a specialist in international migration economics at UC Davis, sees more as a maneuver aimed at drastically cutting immigration. Trump has said nothing precise about his desired immigration numbers, although in a major speech as a candidate last summer he called for keeping ""immigration levels, measured by population share, within historic norms"" -- language that groups have used when pointing to the 1960s and '70s, when the immigrant share of the nation's population was about 1 in 20 people, rather than 1 in 8 as it is today. [...]Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who has talked with Trump about immigration and seems to be in line with his thinking, joined Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) in introducing legislation that would not only reorient policy to favor the highly skilled, but also slash total immigration by 40% to 50%, largely by limiting family-sponsored visas and cutting the number of refugee entrants in half.

The idea was inspired by one of the town's many famous residents: actor Martin Sheen. In December, he grabbed the lectern during a City Council meeting and -- as if conjuring his inner President Josiah Bartlet from ""The West Wing"" -- urged the city to become a sanctuary city. Everyone agrees the city has workers who are not authorized to be in the country, and they tend to serve the food at upscale eateries, clean the beachside mansions, look after children and keep the landscaping looking lush. In the face of ""that heroic resolution, and the heightened level of fear gripping so much of our nation since Nov. 8, we urge the council to adopt a resolution declaring the city of Malibu a sanctuary city."" [...]the city contracts out its policing and jailing to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. At the council meeting, resident Elizabeth Stevens recalled how she worked two jobs to get through school and get a car, only to have it totaled by someone who was in the country illegally. For some cities, the sanctuary movement has simply been a push to get people without legal status more involved in government.",1878701822,Newspapers," Oreskes, BenjaminBenjaminBenjamin OreskesOreskesBenjamin Oreskes",," Copyright Los Angeles Times Mar 20, 2017"," 7683 , PQ_7683_Mar202017 , LATMLATM201703206925 , LATMLATM201703206925", News," Mar 20, 2017",0458-3035, English, English, B.1," Los Angeles, Calif.","Mar 20, 2017",Los Angeles Times,2017,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1878701822?accountid=14496,, B.1," Immigration policy , Sanctuary movement , Photographers , Councils , Cooperation , City ordinances , Employment , Aliens , United States--US , Guatemala , Malibu California"," MALIBU (CA) , IMMIGRANTS , DEPORTATION , SANCTUARY , CELEBRITIES",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alatimes&amp;atitle=IMMIGRATION%3B+Malibu+votes+to+adopt+%27sanctuary+city%27+status%3B+Officials+narrowly+approve+resolution+as+a+gesture+of+solidarity+with+workers+who+are+in+the+U.S.+illegally&amp;title=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;issn=04583035&amp;date=2017-03-20&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=B.1&amp;au=Oreskes%2C+Benjamin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Los Angeles TimesNo Crackdown on Illegal Employers,,1878703149,Newspapers,,," Copyright New York Times Company Mar 20, 2017"," 957682-20170320 , 957682-20170320 , 7818 , PQ_7818_Mar202017", Editorial," Mar 20, 2017",0362-4331, English, English, A.22," New York, N.Y.","Mar 20, 2017",New York Times,2017,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1878703149?accountid=14496,, A.22," Immigration policy , Citizenship , Deportation , Bills , Employment , Aliens , Legislators , Employers , Editorials , Foreign labor , Law enforcement , United States--US , Trump, Donald J , Mexico",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=No+Crackdown+on+Illegal+Employers%3A+%5BEditorial%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2017-03-20&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.22&amp;au=&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,New York Times'Horrified With Dismay': Travel Ban Dampens a Holiday,,1878708704,Newspapers," Medina, JenniferJenniferJennifer MedinaMedinaJennifer Medina",," Copyright New York Times Company Mar 20, 2017"," 966231-20170320 , 966231-20170320 , 7818 , PQ_7818_Mar202017", News," Mar 20, 2017",0362-4331, English, English, A.8," New York, N.Y.","Mar 20, 2017",New York Times,2017,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1878708704?accountid=14496,, A.8," Bans , Passports & visas , Families & family life , Travel , New year , Diaspora , Identification documents , Immigration policy , Anxieties , United States--US , Iran",,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=%27Horrified+With+Dismay%27%3A+Travel+Ban+Dampens+a+Holiday%3A+%5BNational+Desk%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2017-03-20&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.8&amp;au=Medina%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,New York Times"USAID Should Promote U.S. Interests, Not 'Safe Spaces'","  (The acronym stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex.)

Among Republicans, that consensus is dissolving. One dissident who bears watching is Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas. He says the U.S. admits too many legal immigrants based on family ties rather than skills, education or the ability to assimilate. Cotton and fellow Republican Sen. David Perdue have introduced a bill that would cut legal immigration in half. And while it's a low priority in Congress now, Mr. Cotton may one day influence the approach of President Donald Trump, who has also argued for less legal, and illegal, immigration. The core of Mr. Cotton's critique is that historically, immigration comes in big waves. The country struggles to assimilate the newcomers, resulting in a backlash. The last such backlash came in 1924 when the Immigration Act virtually slammed the door shut on foreign entrants, including Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Europe. Mr. Cotton believes that if Congress had tapered the influx sooner, it would have avoided the draconian restrictions of 1924.",1879857618,Newspapers," Ip, GregGregGreg IpIpGreg Ip , Ip, GregGregGreg IpIpGreg Ip", Republican Party," (c) 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Only about 650 miles of the border have some sort of fencing today, and adding to that is complicated by geography, politics, landownership issues and funding. Here's a breakdown of which Southwest border-patrol sectors have the most apprehensions -- defined as an arrest of removable aliens -- versus the most or least amount of fencing. (See related graphic -- WSJ March 31, 2017) It's important to note that border security is defined by more than fencing.

There's going to be some effect of immigration"" on wages, said Pia Orrenius, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a member of the panel that wrote the 2016 report. When he set out a few years ago to write a new book on immigration for a general audience, even some of his friends and family struggled with his draft chapter on the labor market. In several of these cases, studies found temporary wage or employment declines for native workers after waves of mass immigration, but much research concludes that immigrants bring broad long-term economic benefits as well. [...]U.S. farmers didn't react to the labor shortage by hiring American laborers at higher wages, according to a recent National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by Michael Clemens, Ethan Lewis and Hannah Postel.

Syrians fleeing civil war pushed into the Continent, soon joined by people from across sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, the Middle East and Far East. When these theories are challenged -- by asking, for instance, why the next generation of Germany's workforce might not come from unemployed Greece rather than Eritrea -- we are told that we need low-skilled workers who do not speak our languages because it makes Europe more culturally interesting. When people point out the downsides of this approach -- not least that more immigration from Muslim countries produces many problems, including terrorism -- we get the final explanation. Because of globalization this is inevitable and we can't stop it anyway.

Both of these instances point to the difficulty with a view that is deeply ingrained in contemporary China and at least implicitly endorsed elsewhere: that to be Chinese is to belong to a race. According to the 2010 census, the country's population of 1.39 billion citizens includes just 1,448 naturalized Chinese. China does not allow dual citizenship, which makes the decision more difficult, but in principle, race is not a barrier to becoming a Chinese citizen. Yan Xuetong, a leading theorist of international relations at Tsinghua University, argues that China should employ more foreigners as public officials and put them on the road to citizenship. The now-discarded one-child policy has created a demographic bulge, with the elderly constituting an ever-growing proportion of the population.",1919056362,Newspapers," Bell, Daniel ADanielDaniel A BellBellADaniel A.

Longtime residents say they love the rhythms of the place; schools close for the first day of deer-hunting season and Friday summer festivals bring lots of residents downtown.

[...]July, only two lawmakers in history had ever run afoul of the law. Scott Ludlam, the co-deputy leader of Australia's Greens Party, stepped down after he was exposed as a dual citizen of New Zealand -- a country he'd left at the age of 3. More than 20 Australian lawmakers have been anxiously contacting embassies to ensure they don't hold dual citizenship. Since citizenship varies in other countries -- sometimes by descent, sometimes requiring paperwork -- the onus is on the lawmaker. The whistleblower in his case was John Cameron, a Perth-based barrister who found Mr. Ludlam's Kiwi roots in a New Zealand register, telling local media he was acting as a citizen with a keen interest in the constitution. ""Harsh words indeed, and a sting to a collective Canadian ego accustomed to veneration from the international community,"" she wrote.

The downside, Mr. Misenti says, was lower retention rates among new workers who lacked industry experience. Because the operation is running less efficiently, he says, the company suspended fishing on some days, forgoing four million pounds of salmon at one of five plants, so the processing plant could catch up. Landscapers, the heaviest users of the H-2B program, appear least affected. Because many need workers earlier in the season, they can apply earlier for the first-come, first-served program. The jobless rate on the island is consistently lower than in the state during the summer, but this summer the differential is greater than it has been for five years, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, suggesting labor is even harder to find than usual for local businesses.",1927723018,Newspapers," Meckler, LauraLauraLaura MecklerMecklerLaura Meckler"," Congress921120"," (c) 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Despite the recent declines, almost 3.8 million people, many of them low-income workers, took the bus to their job in 2015, more than any other form of public transit, according to the Census Bureau. Instead of running regular bus service through the more residential parts of the country, the transit agency offers a $400 monthly subsidy to help commuters who live near each other set up a vanpool. ---",1928294147,Newspapers," Harrison, DavidDavidDavid HarrisonHarrisonDavid Harrison"," California State University San Jose611310 , Mineta Transportation Institute541712 , Bureau of the Census926110"," (c) 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
