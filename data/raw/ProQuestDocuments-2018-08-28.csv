Md. group seeking immigrant protections,"Shortly after taking office in 2014, he reversed the policy of his Democratic predecessor, Martin O'Malley, and agreed to notify U.S. authorities when an undocumented immigrant targeted for deportation was released from the state-run Baltimore city jail.County Executive Allen H. Kittleman (R) on Thursday vetoed legislation approved 3 to 2 by the County Council that would have codified policies that bar police from asking about immigration status of criminal suspects, victims or witnesses.Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett (D) has repeatedly assured immigrant groups that they have nothing to fear from local law enforcement, and that what he calls the ""Montgomery way,"" a body of policies and practices emphasizing tolerance and understanding, will not falter.The directive permits Montgomery officers to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in cases involving drugs, money laundering, human trafficking or terrorism, but not violations of federal immigration law.",1866488516,Newspapers," Turque, Bill

Federal appeals court rules 3 to 0 against Trump on travel ban,"In a unanimous 29-page opinion, three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit flatly rejected the government's argument that suspension of the order should be lifted immediately for national security reasons, and they forcefully asserted their ability to serve as a check on the president's power.Last Friday, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart granted the states of Washington and Minnesota a temporary restraining order on the ban.The appeals court judges had questioned both sides skeptically at Tuesday's hearing, seeming particularly interested in what evidence Trump relied upon in implementing his order and what limits the Justice Department saw on the president's authority to set immigration policy.The judges said the Justice Department had ""offered no authority establishing that the White House counsel is empowered to issue an amended order superseding the Executive Order,"" and ""in light of the Government's shifting interpretations of the Executive Order,"" they were not convinced that guidance would hold.Federal courts in New York, California and elsewhere already had blocked aspects of the ban from being implemented, although one federal judge in Massachusetts declared that he did not think that challengers had demonstrated that they had a high likelihood of success.",1866671591,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

Trump might rewrite travel ban,"Move may restore some elements Supreme Court fight still on table, officials say President Trump said Friday that he is considering rewriting his executive order temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the country, indicating that the administration may try to quickly restore some aspects of the now-frozen travel ban or replace it with other measures. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled unanimously Thursday that Trump's travel ban should remain suspended, allowing people previously barred to continue entering the United States. The 9th Circuit judges also rejected the Justice Department's request to narrow a lower-court judge's freeze of the ban, saying that even if that freeze was too broad, it is ""not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the Executive Order."" Justice Department lawyers also argued that the ban no longer applied to green-card holders - citing guidance from the White House counsel issued after the ban took effect - and that challenges on those grounds should thus be invalidated. ""The White House counsel is not the President, and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the Executive Departments,""...",1867098919,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

Son-in-law softens hard edges of foreign policy,"The Mexican diplomat, Luis Videgaray, and Kushner, a White House senior adviser, had concluded that the remarks as drafted would upend the two countries' fragile relationship, so together they urged Trump to soften his language about Mexico. Kushner's back-channel communications with Mexico - the full extent of which has not been previously reported - reveal him to be almost a shadow secretary of state, operating outside the boundaries of the State Department or the National Security Council. Videgaray had come to the White House on Jan. 25 for a full day of private meetings, but it was Kushner who gave him a heads-up that Trump would deliver a speech that afternoon at the Department of Homeland Security where he would sign an executive order on his signature border wall. Videgaray visited Washington just five days after Trump's inauguration and had roughly eight hours of meetings at the White House on Jan. 25 with Kushner and Trump as well as White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and National Trade Council head Peter Navarro. Kushner was angry about the situation, and Videgaray cut short his trip, canceling a scheduled meeting with John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, the officials said. In another sign of Kushner's growing importance, Tillerson invited him to his meeting with Videgaray, which for the first half-hour was just the three men - the U.S. secretary of state, the Mexican foreign minister and the U.S....",1867099425,Newspapers," Rucker, Philip

One view of Islam pits ideology against theology,"For many Americans, President Trump's executive order on immigration was a clear case of religious discrimination since it directly targets Muslim-majority countries and gives preferential treatment to non-Muslim refugees from those countries.For other Americans, the executive order might not seem to be a case of religious discrimination - not because the policy doesn't differentiate between Muslims and non-Muslims, but because they are skeptical that Islam is actually a religion. ""Islam is not even a religion; it is a political system that uses a deity to advance its agenda of global conquest,"" said John Bennett, a Republican lawmaker in the Oklahoma state legislature, in 2014.There are strong similarities between sharia and Jewish law, or halakhah, which descends from legalistic sections of the Bible that both Jews and Christians consider scripture.The idea of Islam as a political ideology fits well with our particular political moment.Since the fall of communism, some Western intellectuals, most notably the late Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington, have argued that the next great global struggle will be between Western civilization and Islamic civilization.",1867099613,Newspapers," Schulson, Michael

"After court loss, Trump weighs new travel order","Trump insisted that he was confident his policy was on solid legal ground, a day after judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries and on all refugees. The administration was considering several options, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said late Friday at the White House, including asking the Supreme Court to lift the temporary restraining order on the travel ban that the 9th Circuit panel kept in place. If Trump does decide to fight the restraining order all the way to the Supreme Court, he may undercut his objectives, legal experts warn, particularly given the court's 4-4 split between Republican and Democratic appointees. The court could allow the ban to apply to thousands of foreigners who have obtained U.S. visas but have not yet used them, but not to green card holders, foreign students, doctors, technology company executives and tourists who were already living in the U.S. when the travel restrictions were announced. ""Even if the [temporary restraining order] might be over-broad in some respects, it is not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the executive order,"" the panel ruled. -- michael.memoli@latimes.com Twitter:...",1867108097,Newspapers," Memoli, Michael A

A key engineer for Trump's agenda,"In the years before he became a top adviser to President Trump and a leading West Wing advocate for the executive order temporarily halting entry into the United States from seven majority-Muslim countries, Miller was developing his skills as a culture warrior and conservative provocateur eager to condemn liberal orthodoxy - particularly on matters of race and identity. Starting as a teenager, with his frequent calls to the nationally syndicated ""Larry Elder Show,"" Miller made a name for himself in conservative media circles for his willingness to take controversial stands and act as a champion for those on the right who felt maligned by a culture of political correctness. Miller, whose White House title is senior adviser to the president for policy, has been at Trump's side for more than a year, joining his campaign in January 2016 when Sessions, who was sworn in Thursday as attorney general, was one of the only Republican officials to endorse the businessman's candidacy. [...]Miller sometimes served as the warm-up act for Trump at his large campaign rallies, including a rip-roaring speech in Wisconsin during the Republican primary when Miller thrashed Trump's chief rival, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), for supporting increases in legal immigration that would result in more Muslims entering the country - a position Miller charged that Cruz held with ""no regard, no concern"" for how it would ""affect the security of you and your family.""

Trump might rewrite travel ban,"Move may restore some elements Supreme Court fight still on table, officials say President Trump said Friday that he is considering rewriting his executive order temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the country, indicating that the administration may try to quickly restore some aspects of the now-frozen travel ban or replace it with other measures. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled unanimously Thursday that Trump's travel ban should remain suspended, allowing people previously barred to continue entering the United States. The 9th Circuit judges also rejected the Justice Department's request to narrow a lower-court judge's freeze of the ban, saying that even if that freeze was too broad, it is ""not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the Executive Order."" Justice Department lawyers also argued that the ban no longer applied to green-card holders - citing guidance from the White House counsel issued after the ban took effect - and that challenges on those grounds should thus be invalidated. ""The White House counsel is not the President, and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the Executive Departments,"" the judges wrote. [...]in light of the Government's shifting interpretations of the Executive Order, we cannot say that the current interpretation by White House counsel, even if authoritative and binding, will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings.""",1867259435,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

Son-in-law softens hard edges of foreign policy,"The Mexican diplomat, Luis Videgaray, and Kushner, a White House senior adviser, had concluded that the remarks as drafted would upend the two countries' fragile relationship, so together they urged Trump to soften his language about Mexico. Kushner's back-channel communications with Mexico - the full extent of which has not been previously reported - reveal him to be almost a shadow secretary of state, operating outside the boundaries of the State Department or the National Security Council. Videgaray had come to the White House on Jan. 25 for a full day of private meetings, but it was Kushner who gave him a heads-up that Trump would deliver a speech that afternoon at the Department of Homeland Security where he would sign an executive order on his signature border wall. Videgaray visited Washington just five days after Trump's inauguration and had roughly eight hours of meetings at the White House on Jan. 25 with Kushner and Trump as well as White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and National Trade Council head Peter Navarro. Kushner was angry about the situation, and Videgaray cut short his trip, canceling a scheduled meeting with John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, the officials said. In another sign of Kushner's growing importance, Tillerson invited him to his meeting with Videgaray, which for the first half-hour was just the three men - the U.S. secretary of state, the Mexican foreign minister and the U.S....",1867259543,Newspapers," Rucker, Philip

Through social media and pop-up legal clinics, immigrant rights groups have doled out around-the-clock assistance as federal officials pushed back against the notion that the detentions reflect a vast overhaul of immigration enforcement under President Trump. Officials with the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had conducted ""targeted enforcement operations"" focused on detaining people with criminal backgrounds in cities across the country.

Why do we still let 12-year-olds get married?,"Unchained At Last, a nonprofit I founded to help women resist or escape forced marriage in the United States, spent the past year collecting marriage license data from 2000 to 2010, the most recent year for which most states were able to provide information. Despite these alarming numbers, and despite the documented consequences of early marriages, including negative effects on health and education and an increased likelihood of domestic violence, some state lawmakers have resisted passing legislation to end child marriage - because they wrongly fear that such measures might unlawfully stifle religious freedom or because they cling to the notion that marriage is the best solution for a teen pregnancy. The U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls , released last year by the State Department, lists reducing child, early and forced marriage as a key goal. The strategy includes harsh words about marriage before 18, declaring it a ""human rights abuse"" that ""produces devastating repercussions for a girl's life, effectively ending her childhood"" by forcing her ""into adulthood and motherhood before she is physically and mentally mature."" (The actual number is probably higher, as some states did not provide spousal ages.) Some children were married at an age, or with a spousal age difference, that constitutes statutory rape under their state's laws. Many of the states that provided data included categories such as ""14 and younger,"" without specifying exactly how much younger some brides and grooms were.

The administration also assured Democratic lawmakers that it would formalize guidance to allow for case-by-case waivers of dual nationals from the four countries named in the 2015 law, especially in situations where travel was connected to international organizations, journalism or legitimate business reasons. [...]the Obama administration announcement emphasized that ""the addition of these three countries is indicative of the [Homeland Security] Department's continued focus on the threat of foreign fighters."" Charles Kurzman, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who tracks Muslim American violent extremism, says that since the 9/11 attacks, only 23percent of Muslim Americans involved in extremist plots had family backgrounds in the seven countries identified by Trump - and that ""there have been no fatalities in the United States caused by extremists with family backgrounds in those countries.""

Living in fear of deportation is terrible for your health,"The nearly 100,000 other east Africans in Minnesota are painfully aware of the president's recent temporary ban on refugees and visa-holders from their homeland and other predominantly Muslim countries, and of the administration's public statements:Physicians, therapists and community leaders such as Mohamed have for years been using my Center for Mind-Body Medicine's model of self-care and group support to help this population deal with their stress.[...]a study published last month in the International Journal of Epidemiology by University of Michigan researchers provides hard biological evidence that these changes can be transmitted to the next generation.(Previous years, too, showed normal rather than depressed birth rates.)

BACK STORY; Can Trump really 'send in feds' to clean up Chicago?; Presidents have the power to dispatch troops inside U.S. in some cases,"A few days after moving into the White House, President Trump put the third-largest city in the country on notice: ""If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!"" The president's ominous -- if vague -- tweet to Chicagoans echoed back decades to when troops were dispatched to U.S. cities as racial unrest roiled the country. ""Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any State by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings,"" the act reads, ""he may call into Federal service such of the militia of any State."" [...]President George W. Bush dispatched thousands of National Guard troops into the Gulf Coast region to help with disaster relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005. Last year, Chicago saw 762 recorded homicides -- its highest yearlong total in almost two decades, which many attribute to poverty, failing schools and a disconnect between police and the communities they patrol.

LETTERS; Hypocrisy on judges,"[...]let's not forget Barack Obama publicly attacking the Supreme Court justices to their faces in front of the entire nation during his State of the Union speech because they dared disagree with him on a case they had recently decided. David Goodwin Los Angeles :: Trump's inappropriate intrusion into the judicial review of his executive order on immigration contains an important and correct observation. Despite Trump's bullying, false proclamations, poorly executed orders and now personal attacks on federal judges, Republican leaders have yet to display any meaningful disapproval. The president's recent interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, in which he brushed off Russian President Vladimir Putin's misbehavior by saying the U.S. is not innocent of killing either, was particularly telling. Climate change: bad for business Re ""GOP statesmen's climate plan pushes carbon tax,"" Feb. 8 Thank you for publishing an article on senior GOP figures pushing the White House to consider a carbon tax to lower greenhouse gas emissions. A few years ago, Henry Paulson, who served as Treasury secretary in Republican George W. Bush's administration, helped to start the pro-carbon tax Risky Business Project, which argues that climate change isn't just bad for the environment, but also downright disastrous for business in the long run.

Will setback get Trump to change?; A loss like the ruling against his travel ban would normally lead a president to consider a different approach.,"Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who leads the House Oversight Committee, joined Democrats in calling for an ethics rebuke against senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who promoted the fashion line of Trump's daughter in a televised interview from the White House. ""When you look at the totality -- we've issued 25, plus or minus, executive actions, nominated a Supreme Court justice,"" Sean Spicer, White House press secretary, said in an interview.Presidents eventually figure out they need to shift power away from campaign aides who helped them win election in favor of experts in government who can craft policy and manage the bureaucracy more effectively, said Elaine Kamarck, a former aide in the Clinton White House who writes about the office of the presidency.Yet hours after he moderated on China, he refreshed his attack on the judiciary in unusually personal terms, calling the appeals court ruling ""disgraceful"" on Twitter.Trump advisors who pushed for the travel ban said they were not deterred by Thursday's decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which some expected to lose.Trump's court setback has emboldened Democrats, who are still trying to emerge from a devastating election that saw them surrender White House control to the GOP.Trump has been in touch with House Speaker Paul D.

"Losing Hope in U.S., Refugees Make Icy Trek to Canada","The Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council, known locally as Welcome Place, typically serves 50 to 60 asylum seekers per year, said its executive director, Rita Chahal. While the government of Canada was unable to provide statistics on the number of people seeking refugee status who illegally enter the country, Sgt. Harold Pfleiderer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said ""there has been an increase in illegal migration in Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia, with the largest increase being seen in Quebec."" A loophole in the rules covering asylum seekers has led some to walk for as long as eight hours in the middle of the night, through wintry landscapes and biting prairie cold, before arriving in Emerson. [...]in light of the uncertainty and disruption created by President Trump's executive order on immigration, refugee advocates and human rights groups in Canada are demanding that the government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suspend or cancel the refugee pact, which is known as the Safe Third Country agreement. On Wednesday, the immigration and refugee clinical program at Harvard Law School issued a report stating that Mr. Trump's executive orders on immigration made the United States ""not a safe country of asylum"" for people fleeing persecution and violence. From Emerson, the refugee applicants typically take cabs for the 70-mile trip to the provincial capital of Winnipeg, where they formally apply for asylum, welfare checks and legal aid.",1867273994,Newspapers," Porter, Catherine

[...]the sale of silencers has been restricted nationally since the 1930s because of fears that they help criminals avoid attention after shootings, and the National Rifle Association's battle for them seems to be rooted in its broader campaign to eviscerate gun laws.

Getting the words out at 100,"A pencil sketch on the living room wall of Henry Morgenthau III's home depicts three versions of him: a skinny figure at 13, fatter at 20 and burdened with a grotesque potbelly at 40. ""A Sunday in Purgatory,"" published by Passager Books at the University of Baltimore, draws from his life as a scion of a prominent Jewish American family that includes his grandfather, Henry Morgenthau, who immigrated to New York from Germany in 1866 and served as ambassador to Turkey, and his father, Henry Morgenthau Jr., treasury secretary under Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sitting in his apartment at the retirement community Ingleside at Rock Creek as snow swirled outside, he spoke of how the city had changed since he lived here in the 1930s. [...]you just stayed at home,"" he said. When Roosevelt died in 1945, Morgenthau was serving in Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army in Europe, and a letter his father wrote him about dining with the president the night before he died became material for his poem, ""A Terrific Headache:"" Before that last supper, he steadied the trembling hand of his long time boss and friend as he mixed Bourbon Old Fashioneds and nibbled caviar, a gift from the Soviet ambassador. ' "" Morgenthau's study and living room are lined with books, art, and photographs of him with FDR, JFK, Jimmy Carter and, beside the menorahs and carefully tended orchids, one taken with Barack Obama when he was campaigning for the 2008 Democratic nomination.

The asylum seekers are taking these risks because of the Safe Third Country Agreement between Canada and the United States, which says that refugee claimants must make their claim in the country of arrival. In part, that was because of the Real ID Act, which requires asylum seekers to show identification documents they often can't access or that have been destroyed because of the years of war and chaos in Somalia.

Trump aide combative on TV shows,"The White House is pursuing several options to reinstate President Trump's travel ban on all refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations, fighting back against what one top adviser on Sunday called ""judicial usurpation of power."" White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, the author of the controversial executive order, said the administration was weighing several legal options after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled unanimously Thursday against reinstating the travel ban, which had been blocked temporarily by a federal judge in Washington state. Miller said that officials are considering appealing with the 9th Circuit and having an emergency hearing ""en banc,"" or before a larger panel of judges on the court; seeking an emergency stay at the Supreme Court; taking the case to trial at the district level; or writing a new executive order for Trump to sign that would withstand legal scrutiny.",1867454026,Newspapers," Rucker, Philip

Bannon's Navy experience shaped his worldview,"A U.S. helicopter crashed into another aircraft in the Iranian desert, killing eight service members and dooming the plan to liberate the hostages. Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker best known for his time as chairman of the conservative website Breitbart, has become one of the most powerful figures in Washington as chief strategist for Trump. [...]in an unusual move for a political operative, Bannon secured a permanent seat on the National Security Council, giving him a voice in critical decisions on defense and foreign policy. White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited Bannon's naval service as justification for giving him a seat on the Security Council, saying during a Jan. 29 appearance on ABC's ""This Week"" that such service gave him ""a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now."" A review by The Washington Post of Bannon's naval career, based on interviews with more than 25 shipmates and an examination of deck logs stored at the National Archives, found that his service was steady but unremarkable. The records show that his deployments never involved warfare, and the closest he came to conflict may have been his brief experience at the edge of the hostage-rescue fiasco. Grueling duty, but no combat Bannon, who grew up in a Democratic family in Richmond, signed up for the Naval Reserve in 1976, after graduating from Virginia Tech, and then arrived at age 24 at the Navy's training center in Rhode Island in 1977.

A typical dairy cow produces 33 tons of manure a year, according to the activist Community Water Center, and there are 1.6 million dairy cows in the San Joaquin Valley. Animal manure and chemical fertilizer produce nitrate that sinks into the groundwater and is pumped up through wells into home plumbing. An overload of nitrate can cause ""blue baby syndrome"" -- shortness of breath and skin-darkening -- miscarriages, stillbirths, premature births, sudden infant death syndrome, diarrhea and cancer.

"In One Week, Agents Arrest 600 People Across the U.S. in Immigration Raids","Gang members, drug dealers &amp; others are being removed!"" But Gillian Christensen, acting press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said, ""The focus of these targeted enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE's Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis."" Mr. Trump's executive order also vastly expanded the group of immigrants considered priorities for deportation, including those without criminal records. When asked if the recent operations had incorporated the new priorities, a Homeland Security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because operations were continuing, said, ""The president has been clear in saying that D.H.S. should be focused on removing individuals who pose a threat to public safety, who have been charged with criminal offenses, who have committed multiple immigration violations or who have been deported and re-entered the country illegally.""

"Migrating North, but to Mexico, Not the U.S.","[...]Mexico, under pressure from immigrants' advocates, has been granting asylum at increasingly higher rates, in part because of improvements to its intake and processing system. The increase in asylum petitions in Mexico is also in part due to the rise in detentions on the country's southern flank, an effect of an American-backed plan begun in 2014 to better control the flow of people and goods crossing the Mexico-Guatemala border. After being stopped by the immigration authorities, some detainees have come to learn that they may be eligible for asylum, either through word of mouth from other detainees or during screenings with immigration officials. ""Many come here not knowing that the experiences they've had fit perfectly with asylum,"" said Javier Martínez Hernández, a lawyer at Casa del Migrante, which helped more than 100 migrants apply for refugee status in 2016, more than double the number in 2015. In the past year, the Mexican government has made a number of improvements to its asylum system, including increasing its staff and modifying the screening process to ensure that eligible migrants have a chance to apply, officials said. The Mexican authorities have also begun releasing asylum seekers from detention while they await the resolution of their cases, a process that often takes three or more months, and have improved applicants' access to humanitarian aid and psychological and legal counseling, advocates said. The government and the United Nations have sponsored a pilot program in Saltillo to help integrate asylum seekers into Mexican society.",1867459713,Newspapers," Semple, Kirk

Md. may give affirmative consent a yes in sex ed,"Two Maryland lawmakers are pushing legislation that would require the state's public schools to teach a ""yes means yes"" standard for sexual consent, wading into a national debate as they try to change the way young people think about intimate relationships. A bill sponsored by Kelly and Morales that would require Montgomery public schools to teach affirmative consent in sexual-education classes will be the focus of a hearing Tuesday before the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees education policy. A growing national debate has accompanied a movement by college campuses across the country to adopt affirmative-consent standards for adjudicating sexual assault allegations - essentially telling students they must have explicit consent from their partner to engage in sexual activity. The changes come partly in response to a 2011 letter from the U.S. Department of Education warning colleges that they risk losing federal funding if they don't adjudicate sexual-assault cases...",1867794043,Newspapers," Hicks, Josh

Embattled Trump official resigns; National security advisor Michael Flynn had misled the administration about his contacts with a Russian diplomat.,"[...]Trump's choice of Flynn as national security advisor, a key White House role, prompted concern among critics who saw Flynn's views as too extreme and noted his own visit to Russia in 2015, where he sat next to Putin at a dinner for RT, the Russian propaganda network.

Trump was silent about Flynn and the latest allegations during a weekend trip to Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida resort, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, where Flynn was often by the president's side. Flynn attended the president's daily intelligence briefing, sat in during Trump's calls with several foreign leaders and went to meetings between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as well as their joint news conference.

Prisons set to cash in on crackdown; Private firms likely to benefit from Trump's immigration plans.,"Stocks for private prison companies have surged in the two weeks since President Trump signed an executive order calling for expansion of immigrant detention facilities at or near the border with Mexico, specifically authorizing the use of private contractors ""to construct, operate, or control facilities"" in what is expected to be a substantial ramp-up of the massive detention system that thrived under the Obama administration. Carl Takei, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project, predicts ""an enormous boondoggle for the private prison industry. Immigrant attorneys and human rights groups have long argued the profit motive spurs private companies to cut corners and cram inmates into shoddy and overcrowded facilities. The idea for an immigrant detention center was born 15 years ago, when a large construction company approached local officials with a pitch to revitalize their economy: borrow $65 million from the public debt markets to build prisons. In 2006, as President George W. Bush pushed to crack down on illegal immigration, the county hired a Texas construction company to build the detention center on a cotton field on the outskirts of town. Yet almost immediately, it struck a new contract with the Bureau of Prisons to expand the facility and house 3,000 immigrants awaiting deportation while serving federal criminal sentences, many convicted of illegally entering the U.S. To fund the expansion, it refinanced, building up more debt. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who previously had accepted donations from private prison lobbyists, had pledged to end for-profit...",1867799960,Newspapers," Jarvie, Jenny

"At Ole Miss, a Liberal Agitator Raises Hackles","Allen Coon, perhaps the most reviled student at the University of Mississippi, was walking to his public policy class at the Trent Lott Leadership Institute on a recent weekday morning, sporting a red faux Trump cap emblazoned with the message MAKE AMERICA NATIVE AGAIN. [...]he is acutely aware that his surname, which doubles as a racial slur, can teeter like an unexploded bomb on the lips of every Mississippian who dares to mutter it. Yet none of that impeded Mr. Coon's transformation into a full-blown campus celebrity in October 2015, when he helped lead the student movement that brought the Confederate-themed state flag down from the university's main flagpole. There was this online comment, folksy and menacing, one of many directed at Mr. Coon after his aborted attempt in November to have Ole Miss declared a ""sanctuary campus"" for undocumented immigrants: ""From what I've read there is a large group that would gleefully use his head for a mop and his butt for a broom and God only knows what's keeping them from it,"" wrote the commenter, who identified himself as John Irwin, on the website of the Clarion-Ledger newspaper. Mr. Coon, who stands about 6-foot-4, with green eyes under heavy eyebrows, was recognized by a number of black students. Not much better, in Mr. Coon's eyes, is the Lott Institute, which offers a degree in public policy leadership. Though he had announced that he would reintroduce his sanctuary campus bill in the student senate, he walked the idea back...",1867807300,Newspapers," Fausset, Richard

China Extends Crackdown to Billionaire's Employees,"In another development, an employee who worked on the computer systems at Mr. Xiao's companies was detained at the Hong Kong airport on Sunday evening, suspected of committing passport violations while trying to fly to Japan, the people familiar with the matter said. Companies under Mr. Xiao's Tomorrow Group, which was founded in 1999, control tens of billions of dollars in assets, and its holdings have included stakes in more than 30 financial institutions, including Ping An, one of China's biggest insurers, as well as Harbin Bank and Industrial Bank. In the months leading up to the conclave, held once every five years, the party puts stability at a premium, and Mr. Xiao, through his substantial holdings, is seen as having the potential to bring instability to China's stock markets. Bill Bishop, who publishes the widely read Sinocism newsletter on Chinese politics, said that China's leaders, including the president, Xi Jinping, and the Communist Party's top antigraft enforcer, Wang Qishan, might see Mr. Xiao's company as a ""systemic threat to the stock market"" in a year when stability is paramount. The magazine, citing people it did not identify, reported that one of the country's top newspapers covering the Chinese stock...",1867807377,Newspapers," Mozur, Paul

Senators of both parties vow to take deeper look at Russia's role in 2016,"Flynn resignation prompts pledges to expand investigation Top Republican and Democratic senators pledged Tuesday to deepen their investigation of Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election in the wake of Michael Flynn's resignation as President Trump's national security adviser, opening a new and potentially uncomfortable chapter in the uneasy relationship between Trump and Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said such an investigation is ""highly likely,"" and the top two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), stood side by side Tuesday to announce that the committee's ongoing probe must include an examination of any contacts between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. Many Democrats think the slow, painstaking but largely public process of an independent commission, such as the 9/11 Commission, is preferable to leaving the investigation in the hands of committees that work in secret, giving leaders more latitude to pull political strings. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called for ""unbiased"" law enforcement officials to lead a federal investigation, adding that Attorney General Jeff Sessions cannot be involved in any probe given his close political connections to the White House and Trump's presidential campaign. In the House, such divisions are already on display, as the House Intelligence Committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), has angled to establish at least a joint congressional inquiry to look into the allegations against Flynn.",1868124245,Newspapers," Sullivan, Sean

Leaks will keep coming -- as they should,"On Jan. 26, the Justice Department told Trump's White House counsel that Flynn's version was untrue -- and that the apparent deception could make him vulnerable to blackmail from Russia. In the Watergate scandal that brought down President Nixon, many of the most important leaks came from ""Deep Throat,"" a source who turned out to be Mark Felt, an associate director of the FBI. In the Iran-Contra scandal that entangled President Reagan, many of the leaks about illicit weapons deals came from the national security bureaucracy, too -- some from officials who thought Reagan's secret arms sales to Iran were a bad idea, others from officials who thought the National Security Council staff had exceeded its authority. Trump's leaks haven't only come from national security bureaucrats, however; his White House staffers are prone to gossip, too, sharing -- for example -- details from his telephone calls with foreign leaders.

Democrats Set Their Sights on Blocking President's Pick for Labor Secretary,"Signs of the fast-food restaurant executive's vulnerability have been swirling in recent weeks as his hearing was delayed several times because of the complexity of his vast financial portfolio, including millions of dollars in preferred stock in the parent company of Hardee's and Carl's Jr., CKE. Protesters have swarmed those fast-food restaurants across the country to express outrage that the person chosen to look out for America's wage workers has a record of fighting for owners' interests. ""Puzder literally likes robots more than workers and does not believe in raising the minimum wage,"" said Ben Jealous, a former head of the N.A.A.C.P. and founding board chairman of the labor group Good Jobs Defenders, who is organizing protests. Pressed by the liberal group Campaign for Accountability, a Missouri circuit court on Tuesday night released some of Mr. Puzder's divorce records detailing the original allegations of abuse. According to the records, the encounter caused ""bruises and contusions to the chest, back, shoulders and neck,"" two ruptured disks, two bulging disks and ""severe and permanent damage."" Even Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, emerged from the sidelines this week to urge Republicans to stick with Mr. Puzder.",1868157997,Newspapers," Rappeport, Alan

[...]they should provide help with transitional costs and logistics to ensure the students' basic needs will initially be met as they make this transition to adulthood and independent living."" A coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia and aided by the United States has conducted a bombing campaign in an effort to drive the Houthis back, killing more than 10,000 people and displacing more than 3 million, according to the United Nations.

Messages on receipts: Freedom's price tag,"First there was the Trump administration's travel ban, then talk about the Mexican border wall and, finally, last week, Alfredo Solis decided it was time to send a message. [...]the owner of Mezcalero, the hottest new Mexican restaurant in the District, put it at the bottom of his receipts: ""Immigrants help make America great!"" ""I came to this country 17 years ago, and I work hard. ""Receipts have always been a place where you can talk back and forth,"" said Brian Warrener, an associate professor at Johnson &amp; Wales University's School of Hospitality. To the restaurateurs who are putting messages on their receipts, it might seem more effective than an ""Immigrants are welcome here"" sign on the door or a Langston Hughes poem on the menu. The menu is in diners' hands for only a few minutes - and they're probably more invested in deciding between the chicken and the lamb than in reading about politics. Warrener pointed to the Trump voter who went to Busboys and Poets after the inauguration and tipped his African American waitress $450 on a $72.60 bill, with a note: ""We may come from different cultures and may disagree on certain issues, but if everyone...",1868522250,Newspapers," Judkis, Maura

Labor nominee is Trump's first Cabinet defeat,"Puzder faced growing GOP resistance Withdrawal throws White House into more turmoil Andrew Puzder, President Trump's labor secretary nominee, withdrew from consideration Wednesday amid growing resistance from Senate Republicans centered primarily on Puzder's past employment of an undocumented housekeeper. Puzder's fate amplified the deteriorating relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill, where bipartisan support grew Wednesday for expanded investigations into ties between Trump, his presidential campaign and Russian officials. Some have also accused him of sexism, pointed to a rancorous divorce that involved later-recanted allegations of domestic abuse as well as racy TV ads run by his restaurant chains that featured scantily clad women eating hamburgers. [...]the revelation was particularly troubling to lawmakers because of the job Puzder was seeking: running the Labor Department. The former commercial trial lawyer has been a staunch opponent of rules finalized by the Labor Department last year - and since put on hold - that would have expanded the number of people eligible for overtime pay. [...]Puzder's nomination immediately came under intense scrutiny from unions, labor groups and consumer advocates who worried that the executive would prioritize businesses over workers.",1868522629,Newspapers," O'Keefe, Ed

"In a Denver church, a test of the sanctuary movement","Propelled by President Trump's campaign rhetoric and the election in November, the number of churches and other houses of worship that are offering refuge to undocumented immigrants like Vizguerra has doubled to an estimated 800 over the past year, according to leaders of the loosely knit religious sanctuary movement. Officials said the raids have targeted known criminals, but they also detained some immigrants with minor offenses or no criminal records, in an apparent departure from the Obama administration's policy of focusing on those who had committed serious crimes. Twelve years after crossing the border, Vizguerra was pulled over in 2009 for a traffic violation and convicted of falsifying a Social Security number, which she said she planned to use to secure a part-time job. Extending sanctuary The current religious sanctuary movement, which began to take shape about 10 years ago, was inspired by a 1980s effort that provided shelter to thousands fleeing to the United States from civil war in Central American countries, said movement co-founder Alexia Salvatierra, a Lutheran pastor and an immigration rights activist in Pasadena, Calif.

Mattis delivers a stern warning to Europe,"The hammer-hard message - a warning from Mattis that allies must significantly increase their defense spending ""if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to this alliance"" - was a harsh threat to countries that have been struggling with anemic growth and high unemployment. On Friday, Mattis will be joined in Munich at a security conference by Vice President Pence, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly and more than a dozen members of Congress, many of whom have turned out to reassure U.S. allies that Washington remains committed to them. ""What has happened is that in Europe we harvested the peace dividend very, very quickly"" after the end of the Cold War eliminated the need for large standing armies, said Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a former NATO secretary general who led the 2014 effort to secure pledges from NATO members to spend 2 percent of their annual gross domestic product on defense.

LETTERS; Watergate redux?,"Re ""White House reeling amid fallout from aide's ouster,"" Feb. 15 I wondered why President Trump so vehemently resisted inquiry into Russian involvement in our campaign and election when this issue first gained increased attention shortly after Nov. 8. With the resignation of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and other revelations about the Trump campaign's contact with Russian officials, the question in my mind is eerily reminiscent of President Nixon's Watergate: What does the president know and when did he know it? If Flynn behaved inappropriately, the proper avenue for investigation is Congress, not intelligence and law enforcement personnel anonymously leaking the details of his conversations with foreign officials. James Sallis San Diego :: How long will it be and at what cost to the nation before Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republican leaders grow some spine and character and stop kowtowing to the charade of this presidency? The idea that gender is fixed by biology fails to recognize a key feature of the human brain produced by evolution: experience-dependent brain plasticity, or malleability, which allows one to learn information presented in the environment, including social norms.

"A fitful flight from a Salvadoran scourge; One boy, now in L.A., is among the latest to flee gangs","Extortion is rampant, with gangs squeezing street vendors, restaurant owners and even grandmothers for cash. The specter of violence is driving increasing numbers of asylum seekers to nearby countries, such as Costa Rica and Mexico, while thousands of others attempt the perilous 2,000-mile journey to the United States. A record 17,512 unaccompanied Salvadoran children were apprehended at the U.S. border in the fiscal year that ended in September, according to the Department of Homeland Security. After the threatening phone calls continued, and menacing-looking men started loitering outside the house, Mauricio and his family decided last summer to test the new program created by President Obama that allows Central American children with at least one parent living legally in the U.S. to apply for refugee status while in their home country. The government has estimated that nearly half a million people are now connected to the gangs -- in a country of slightly more than 6 million. Since 2003, the government has taken what it calls an ""iron fist"" approach to criminal groups, sending soldiers armed with automatic weapons and dressed in black balaclavas into gang-controlled areas. Recently, federal prosecutors have accused law enforcement officials of going too far -- of ""disappearing"" young men -- and residents of some neighborhoods have complained of extrajudicial killings. The gangsters called so many times, even after Mauricio changed his phone number, that for a short time he thought that joining the gang might be his only way out.

PUZDER BOWS OUT AS GOP WAVERS,"Puzder, chief executive of Carpinteria-based CKE Restaurants Inc., the parent company of the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's chains, abruptly withdrew just a day before he was to face a Senate confirmation hearing.[...]his decision to pull out was triggered by concerns from a growing number of Senate Republicans about decades-old allegations of spousal abuse and an admission that he had employed a housekeeper who was in the U.S. illegally.Puzder also was an outspoken opponent of increased government regulation, criticizing the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration's attempt to expand the number of workers eligible for overtime pay.Senior Senate Republican leaders informed the White House on Wednesday that Puzder did not have the votes, according to a GOP aide granted anonymity to discuss the private talks.Labor law violations and his opposition to a significant minimum wage hike were among a number of complaints against him.; PHOTOGRAPHER:",1868536822,Newspapers," Puzzanghera, Jim

"Trump Administration Plans New Immigration Order Next Week, Ends Legal Push in Appeals Court; 'The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision,' president says","(Feb. 17, 2017) WASHINGTON--The Justice Department told an appeals court Thursday that President Donald Trump would soon rescind and replace his controversial executive order on visas and refugees, adding that the court had no further reason to consider the current version. Multiple other courts have ruled against Mr. Trump and placed the executive order on hold, notably the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco. The Ninth Circuit last week found the order likely violated constitutional guarantees of due process, while a federal judge in Virginia this week said it likely violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination. The White House attempted to clarify the initial order saying it didn't apply to legal permanent residents of the U.S., for example, but some courts have declined to credit that clarification; it's possible Mr. Trump could resolve that issue more formally. Following the Ninth Circuit ruling last week, by a three-judge panel, an unnamed judge on the court asked colleagues to vote on whether to reconsider the case before a larger group of judges. A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said the Trump administration asked that the session be limited to members of Congress with ""jurisdictional interests"" in immigration enforcement, such as leaders of relevant committees and subcommittees.",1868801491,Newspapers," Kendall, Brent

U.S. Orders Slowdown of Refugee Resettlements; State Department slows work on cases involving refugee travel to the U.S. scheduled for after March 3,"(Feb. 17, 2017) The U.S. State Department has ordered embassies to slow resettlement of refugees for the next few weeks and delay booking travel for refugees after March 3 as the numbers approach the annual cap of 50,000 set recently by President Donald Trump, according to American officials. Last week, a federal-appeals court ruling stayed parts of the executive order, lifting the immigration and travel bans and restarting the flow of refugees. The department's filing came in the San Francisco-based Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel last week ruled the executive order couldn't be implemented because it went too far in limiting travelers to the U.S. Ben Kesling in Erbil, Iraq contributed to this article.

Trump Picks Alexander Acosta to Serve as Labor Secretary; Acosta would be first Hispanic member of Trump's Cabinet; nomination comes after Andrew Puzder withdrew,"Mr. Acosta, who was named Thursday, has already passed muster with senators three times, winning confirmation under President George W.

Mr. Acosta defended the outcome as the toughest punishment possible based on available evidence and given the challenge of going up against Mr. Epstein's powerhouse legal team. Since leaving government, Mr. Acosta has pointed to his record at the Justice Department of defending the civil rights of Muslim-Americans.

Trump Lets Loose Against Critics; Freewheeling news conference quickly devolves into a litany of grievances,"The pushback effort comes as Mr. Trump, a Republican, seeks to go on the offense amid escalating tensions between the White House and U.S. intelligence officials, with the president accusing the intelligence community of leaking classified information to the news media. The White House is also facing a mushrooming number of investigations and inquiries on Capitol Hill, where some Republicans are demanding more information about news media reports on contacts between Mr. Trump's associates and Russian officials. Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Thursday that U.S. intelligence officials have been unable to provide evidence of any contact between Russian officials and Mr. Trump's campaign staff, or members of the presidential transition team, beyond those acknowledged by former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn. Late Wednesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, asked the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a briefing on the circumstances that led to Mr. Flynn's resignation. The two said that reports about Mr. Flynn's departure ""raise substantial questions about the content and context of Mr. Flynn's discussions with Russian officials, the conclusions reached by the Justice Department and the actions it took in response, as well as possible leaks of classified information by current and former government employees.""",1868853810,Newspapers," Lee, Carol E

"A new home, a new sport - and an old resilience","[...]he repeated it as his family spent a frantic two weeks uprooting their lives and fleeing Afghanistan, putting Mohsin's dream of an Olympic gold medal on hold. Less than three years later, Mohsin, now 19, is a senior at Edison High in Alexandria and one of the region's most dominant high school athletes in a sport he had never tried before his arrival in Virginia on Sept. 9, 2014. 'No hope in Afghanistan' Mohsin and his then-22-year-old uncle, Zafar, knew that trouble lurked the moment they saw the three men loitering across the darkened side street, their eyes peering out warily from faded scarf masks. Zubair, now 36, had submitted his application for the Special Immigrant Visa - an expedited visa for Iraqi and Afghan nationals who worked with the U.S. Armed Forces or under Chief of Mission authority as a translator or interpreter - about one year earlier. In his ensuing 11 years as a manager for USAID Implementing Partners, he hid his face whenever he entered Kabul's U.S. embassy, telling curious acquaintances he was a driver or a cleaner whenever they asked. Mohsin came one match short of state tournament qualification that season - his 14-5 lead with 12 seconds remaining in the regional quarterfinal match was wiped away after he body-slammed his helpless opponent - but in his first season at Edison last winter, he won conference, region and state championships.

[...]in 2006, after narrowly losing the presidential election, Lopez Obrador provoked a political crisis by refusing to accept the victory of Felipe Calderon, a conservative, and instead declaring himself the nation's ""legitimate president."" After he again lost the presidential election in 2012, Lopez Obrador left Mexico's main leftist party - the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) - and formed an offshoot called MORENA, or the National Regeneration Movement. Pena Nieto and his traditionally dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) have become deeply unpopular because of a sluggish economy, corruption scandals and the perception that the president has not stood up to Trump. In a speech on Sunday at a cultural center in Tijuana, south of the border from San Diego, he warned that the electoral system was rigged and he predicted fraud in next year's vote. Trump's threats to deport illegal immigrants and the recent wave of immigration raids in several U.S. cities have alarmed many in the Mexican diaspora.",1868931287,Newspapers," Partlow, Joshua

Tillerson Meets Russian Counterpart in First Trip as Top Diplomat,"[...]Mr. Tillerson and his entourage of temporary State Department helpers took rooms at a rambling health clinic and spa next to a public bathhouse in the picturesque town of Bad Neuenahr, more than 20 miles outside the city -- a bit like holing up in Beltsville, Md., for a conference in Washington.

Britain's foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, for instance, breezed into his meeting with Mr. Tillerson almost half an hour late, his blond hair flying as he dashed out of his motorcade of black Mercedes sedans, past old women in wheelchairs and into an entrance with a sign that read, Steigenberger Sanatorium, Private Clinic. The Obama administration often used its traveling press corps as a diplomatic weapon, telling even autocratic counterparts that news conferences were an expected part of any trip and therefore even leaders who almost never spoke to reporters felt obliged to answer a few questions.",1868944671,Newspapers," Gardiner, Harris

"Trump facing a dilemma on young migrants; He's shown sympathy for 'Dreamers,' yet the White House has found ways to quietly end their protections.","An executive order has already been drafted to end the Obama administration program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, which allows hundreds of thousands of the immigrants to live and work openly in the U.S. Trump used that legal mechanism to great fanfare to expand deportation authority and restrict entry into the country. [...]some Republican strategists are concerned that suspending DACA could energize Latino voters and liberal activists in key congressional districts during the midterm election campaign next year. If the Justice Department determines that DACA is not legal or is no longer a responsible use of prosecutorial discretion, the Department of Homeland Security would be instructed to stop awarding and renewing work permits. Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly could simply instruct U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to stop issuing work permits, much as Obama's first secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, created DACA with a memo in 2012. [...]though few immigration advocates have a direct connection with the new administration because they are largely seen as allied with Democrats, several Latino evangelical leaders believe their talks with Trump's transition team helped shape the White House's considerations.

New travel ban to be 'tailored' to last in court; The president gives up on appealing what he calls judges' 'very bad decision' blocking his first such order.,"White House officials already have indicated that a new order would most likely be designed to have no impact on current holders of U.S. visas, meaning people with green cards or student or work-related visas would be able to travel without additional restrictions.A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously decided on Feb. 9 to uphold a nationwide block on enforcement of the ban after concluding it was likely to violate the Constitution.Trump downplayed the chaos that erupted at airports around the world after the ban, as workers, students, people trying to visit families in the U.S. and others with valid visas were denied permission to board planes or turned away after arriving in the U.S. State Department officials said an estimated 60,000 visas were canceled, but Trump blamed much of the turmoil at U.S. airports on a Delta Airlines computer outage, which occurred after people were already detained at airports and while protests were underway.In addition to its 9th Circuit filing Thursday, the Trump administration asked a federal district court in Washington, D.C., that is considering the ban to suspend deadlines for arguments pending a new executive order.Washington state and Minnesota contended the travel ban was hurting business and disrupting public universities and argued that it violated constitutional guarantees of due process and religious freedom. -- maura.dolan@latimes.com jaweed.kaleem@latimes.com Caption: PHOTO:",1868945212,Newspapers," Dolan, Maura

Rowdy rebuttal; Trump responds to setbacks with a fiery news conference reminiscent of campaign,"President Trump tried to shrug off one of the rockiest presidential starts in recent history by returning Thursday to comfortable terrain: an unwieldy news conference in which he was at turns combative, aggrieved, funny and nostalgic for the spontaneous give-and-take that characterized his campaign. For well over an hour, he deflected and hedged about whether his campaign staff was in contact with Russian government officials before his election, saying in lawyerly fashion that ""nobody I know of"" had and that he personally had no business involvements with the country. [...]Trump continued to complain about a federal appeals court's decision to block his temporary ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, while promising to issue a new order next week that he said would withstand judicial scrutiny. [...]the forced resignation of Flynn has prompted bipartisan calls for investigations about his presidential campaign's ties to Russia. [...]Trump went further, insisting that even the immigration ban had gone off without a hitch before the courts blocked it -- ""The rollout was perfect,"" he said -- despite confusion at airports and initial uncertainty that led to the lengthy detentions of many people, forced some with valid visas to be sent home and in all led to some 60,000 visas being invalidated. There were also awkward moments, such as when he responded to an African American reporter's question about the Congressional Black Caucus by asking whether she could arrange the meeting.

What's really new at the border?; Trump may have bad intentions but Obama was also a deporter in chief.,"For good reason, immigration advocates assume that Trump's intentions are malevolent, leading many to the less-reasonable conclusion that each new screening procedure and executive order is breaking new ground in awfulness. The recent raids, however, were planned before Trump had lifted a finger on immigration policy, ICE Field Office Director for Los Angeles David Marin told reporters. The fact is, starting with the 2006 collapse of comprehensive immigration reform, successive pro-reform administrations deliberately used stepped-up enforcement as a political tool--George W. Bush to call the bluff on restrictionists who derailed a treasured second-term goal, Obama to build up ""credibility"" for legislative negotiations that never took off. [...]by treating illegal immigration as a crime problem rather than a prohibition problem, Republicans nurtured the fantasy that if only they had a president with his heart in the right place, we could finally enforce this so-called crisis out of existence.

Some groups such as the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles kept their doors open because people are in dire need of their services, given recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps, said spokesman Jorge-Mario Cabrera. The fact that the boycott began online, rather than with long-standing organizations, was a refreshing change, but it also limited its reach, said Roberto Hernandez, an assistant professor of Chicana and Chicano Studies at San Diego State University. Darius Fequiere, a special education teacher at New Open World Academy in Koreatown, said he was proud of his students for boycotting, but he wanted them to truly understand their actions.

But the court drama could end without a ruling on that very question. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Thursday threw out an earlier ruling by a panel of three judges that the CFPB's single-director structure was unconstitutional, and ordered a rehearing by a larger group of judges. Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond Embattled CFPB Gets a Legal Reprieve By Yuka Hayashi and Brent Kendall WASHINGTON--A federal appeals court handed a reprieve to the embattled federal consumer finance watchdog in a high-profile case questioning its constitutionality, strengthening the agency's position in a continuing battle with Republicans over the leadership and future of the agency. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Thursday wiped out an earlier ruling that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's independent structure was unconstitutional, and ordered a rehearing. Thursday's court order comes amid a contentious fight over the CFPB, which pits Republican lawmakers and administration officials against consumer groups and Democratic lawmakers including Elizabeth Warren, the...",1869026590,Newspapers,," Republican Party

"Trump Team's Growth Forecasts Far Rosier Than Those of CBO, Private Economists; While there are often disparities between the White House and independent agencies on growth projections, they are rarely this large","WASHINGTON--The Trump administration has drafted preliminary economic growth forecasts in its federal budget planning that rely on assumptions that are far rosier than projections made by independent agencies and most private forecasters, according to several people familiar with the discussions. The deliberations show the challenge the administration faces as it tries to reconcile the competing goals of cutting taxes, boosting military and infrastructure spending, preserving Medicare and Social Security programs and keeping budget deficits from soaring. A fast-growing economy produces more revenue while reducing the need for spending on programs such as food stamps or unemployment insurance. The forecasts, which were initiated before President Donald Trump took office, project gross domestic product--a broad measure of national output of goods and services--growing between 3% and 3.5% a year over the coming decade, with inflation-adjusted annual growth ultimately settling at around 3.2% during the later years of the 10-year forecast. Many economists believe sustained growth at more than 3% will be difficult to achieve without a sharp rebound in productivity growth and a reversal in the slowing expansion of the U.S. labor force, developments few are projecting. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates deficit reduction, said Mr. Trump's policies to boost spending on the military and to cut taxes are likely to increase deficits.",1869246414,Newspapers," Timiraos, Nick

"When America Opened Its Doors; For the founders, refugees were ideal citizens: They'd fled tyranny and would be a bulwark against it. Kathleen DuVal reviews ""American Sanctuary: Mutiny, Martyrdom, and National Identity in the Age of Revolution"" by A. Roger Ekirch.","American Sanctuary By A. Roger Ekirch Pantheon, 293 pages, $30 What to Read This Week The human cost of ending rubella; Europe at the crossroads; the doughboys go to hell; when America opened its doors; Stalin in your living room; the heroism of old age; the death of an all-American town; rebooting the Big Bang; and much more. After the British consul in Charleston requested the man's extradition for court-martial, U.S. Secretary of State Timothy Pickering and President John Adams determined that this was a simple case of mutiny and murder on a British ship. Republicans launched a congressional investigation in February 1800 and only a largely party-line vote protected Adams from official censure by Congress. Mr. Ekirch shows how the Robbins controversy helped create one of the most polarized presidential elections in American history. Fury over the Robbins extradition helped Republicans win close elections in several states, giving the majority of the electoral college to Jefferson. For four decades, the country would not extradite a single person facing any charge, and the memory of Robbins helped created a permanent ""political offense"" exemption. President Jefferson's first State of the Union address asked, ""Shall oppressed humanity find no asylum on this globe?"" It was a rhetorical question.",1869368124,Newspapers," DuVal, Kathleen

A race to the left between Democratic rivals for Va. governor,"Last week, he backed marijuana decriminalization as a racial justice issue. Since his surprising entry into the race in January, Perriello has been pitching himself as a populist capable of turning out voters. On the campaign trail, he said he was proud to vote for the Affordable Care Act, even if it meant losing his 2010 reelection, as well as measures to combat climate change. Some of Perriello's most liberal supporters say they're willing to forgive his past stances, as they did when President Barack Obama opposed same-sex marriage and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) supported gun rights. Sokolow, like other activists, has been suspicious of Northam for siding with Republicans early in his state Senate career on budget issues and judicial appointments, to the point where they unsuccessfully asked him to switch parties. Party officials recently shared a mock boxing promotional poster on Twitter featuring the Democratic primary and promising ""more left turns than a 600 mile NASCAR race!"" ""Virginia is a purple state,"" said John Whitbeck, chairman of the Virginia Republican Party. [...]he has used that perch to join protests against defunding Planned Parenthood, back driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants and praise same-sex marriage on Valentine's Day.",1872854059,Newspapers," Nirappil, Fenit

14-year House minority leader reached across the aisle,"Robert H. Michel of Illinois, a conservative Republican and genial politician who served as House minority leader for 14 years - a tenure marked, toward the end, by partisan rancor and intraparty warfare stoked by his firebrand successor, Newt Gingrich - died Feb. 17 at a hospital in Arlington, Va. [...]Mr. Michel, regarded as a master of procedure, remained in the good graces of his colleagues, who elected the congressman minority whip, the second-ranking House Republican leadership post. Mr. Michel was criticized, bitterly and often, by backbenchers in his party for his willingness to compromise with leaders in the Democratic majority, in particular O'Neill; a later House speaker, Tom Foley of Washington state; and the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee's chairman, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois. According to Time magazine, new GOP members recalled that he would counsel them: ""Every day I wake up and look in the mirror and say to myself, 'Today you're going to be a loser.' In an unusually frank news conference in 1993, Mr. Michel said the House had changed, with an increased tolerance for personal attacks and an uptick in the use of social wedge issues to drive Republicans and Democrats even further apart. Without singling out Gingrich - who often attacked the Democratic-controlled House as ""corrupt"" and its leaders as almost fascistically power-mad - Mr. Michel criticized some House members for ""trashing the institution"" and degrading a spirit of ""camaraderie.

From China to the pinnacle of American science,"Zhang was one of its pioneers, and on Wednesday he emerged victorious after a bitter patent dispute.The ruling, by judges with the U.S. Patent Office, declared that Zhang's work on living plant and animal cells was sufficiently original to deserve its own protection.The patent dispute was closely followed in the triangle of geography marked by the institute, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Earlier this week, the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine produced a long report on the ethics of gene editing, arguing for extreme caution when dealing with heritable human traits but leaving open the possibility of use to remove disease-causing genes.The Broad, as it is commonly called, put out a statement of opposition, saying the order ""turns its back on one of America's greatest sources of strength: the flow of visitors, immigrants and refugees who have enriched our nation with their ideas, dreams, drive, energy, and entrepreneurship.""Bacteria evolved a defense mechanism against viral invaders that would insert genetic material into bacterial DNA.Two other researchers, who would become rivals in the patent case, published the first paper describing the gene-editing technique and applied for patents.[...]she fears the ruling could have a chilling effect on scientific communication.",1869472648,Newspapers," Achenbach, Joel

"Making way for new faces; San Diego, long a hub for Iraqi refugees, sees influx of Syrians","Rasha Zarour wraps grains of rice into the grape leaf in her palm as she prepares yebra, a traditional Syrian dish, for her children before they return from school. Resettlement agencies see El Cajon, with its existing network of resources and community services in Arabic, as a prime location for refugees who don't have family in the United States. ""The schools have Arabic-speaking staff to help the clients,"" says Etleva Bejko, director of refugee and immigration services at Jewish Family Service, which helps resettle refugees. At the downtown El Cajon farmers market, resettlement agencies set up booths to explain their services and hand out pamphlets from the American Civil Liberties Union about the right to wear a hijab. Iraqi vendors work one table over, selling cilantro, turnips and herbs from a community garden maintained by immigrants and refugees. The stress of starting anew has been amplified in recent weeks by President Trump's executive order that placed a 120-day ban on all refugee admissions and an indefinite suspension of admission for Syrian refugees. The travel ban is on pause after a federal judge in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order, but Zarour's husband, Ahmad, who still has family in Jordan and Syria, wonders whether the order will affect them. Syrian refugees are flooding resettlement agencies with questions about the order, says David Murphy, executive director of the International Rescue Committee's San Diego chapter.

"In Congress, Republicans are starting to fret; Strain is showing even as they work with Trump toward goals.","The relationship between President Trump and GOP leaders in Congress started as a marriage of convenience, thrown together by necessity and sustained on the promise of pushing a Republican agenda into law. [...]recently, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tolerated Trump's turbulent debut because they agreed with the direction the White House was heading -- or were confident they could nudge it in the desired one. In their first significant rebuke of the White House, Republican senators this week tanked Trump's pick for Labor secretary, fast-food executive Andy Puzder, rather than vote for someone who was accused decades ago of spousal abuse and who hired an immigrant housekeeper who was in the country illegally.

Day Without Immigrants finds chefs in the soup,"The two are co-owners of the restaurant, and they stepped in to cook when almost all of their kitchen staff took a paid day of leave to participate in the nationwide ""A Day Without Immigrants"" strike. [...]was the scene at restaurants across Washington and many other cities Thursday, when immigrant workers, with their colleagues' support, didn't show up to their stations in kitchens and behind host stands and marched in protest of the Trump administration's hard-line approach to immigration policy. The strike was intended to hit all businesses, but the restaurant industry - where immigrants make up nearly a quarter of the national workforce, according to the Institute for Immigration Research at George Mason University - seemed most affected. Some fast-food restaurants in the Pentagon, including a Starbucks, Taco Bell and Burger King, closed. Maziar Farivar, the Iranian-born chef-owner of the Peacock Cafe in Georgetown, said that shortly after President Trump's inauguration, a young white man walked into the restaurant and raised his hand in a 'Heil Hitler'-like salute.

Jacobs drops the mic,"NEW YORK - NEW YORK - Marc Jacobs, who mounted the last show here for the fall 2017 season, saw the documentary ""Hip-Hop Evolution"" several months ago, and it made him nostalgic for his high school years in New York - when rap music and a new fashion aesthetic were emerging, and the definition of Americana was shifting. The women sauntered down the runway in woven coats with furry collars, gold sequined minis, flared trousers, throwback sweatsuits, huge platform boots, giant gold hoop earrings and Stephen Jones-designed takes on Kangol caps. [...]the clothes that he put on the runway are now available for purchase in various flagship stores and online. The collection was filled with ethereal caftans, sparkling gold dresses, motocross leather leggings, distressed leather jackets and evening gowns with geometric cutouts. The designer Sophie Theallet, who took an early stand against dressing the first lady, created a collection of printed dresses and multi-textured evening gowns that, through their silhouettes and proportions, are meant to serve as a kind of protective armor.

ROBERT MICHEL: 1923-2017 [Corrected 02/18/2017],"Robert Michel, a congressman from Peoria who was Republican House minority leader for 14 years, was remembered Friday as a congenial lawmaker adept at crafting compromise during a bygone era of bipartisan cooperation. Earlier he played a key role in lining up Democratic votes for GOP budget resolutions, more defense spending, Social Security reform, tax reform, trade bills and authorization for the Persian Gulf War, said Mike Johnson, another former chief of staff. Michel was 70 when he announced in Peoria in 1993 that he would not seek another term, citing power lost under a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and a new class of lawmakers making their careers by ""trashing the institution."" Republicans looked as though they might claim the majority in 1982, but a public debate over the question of Social Security cuts led to Democratic gains in that election. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served in the House with Michel, quipped at a 1994 tribute to the outgoing congressman: ""The most difficult part of serving with Bob during the 10 years I was in the House was that I had to listen to 1,243 renditions of 'Ol' Man River.

Donald Trump's Revised Travel Ban Would Cover Seven Countries From Prior Order; Draft of replacement executive order reverses inclusion of green-card holders; indefinite ban on Syrian refugees could be scrapped,"A court ruling this month from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco stayed several key provisions of the original order . According to the memo, the draft retains the provision from the previous order that temporarily bans travel to the U.S. by citizens from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. The memo said the Department of Homeland Security is unwilling to put into writing categories of visa seekers that could be exempt from the new order, such as students seeking entry via U.S. government-funded exchange programs. [...]in its ruling, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals was critical of the administration's mixed messages as to whether legal permanent residents, also called green-card holders, were affected.",1869573301,Newspapers," Abi-Habib, Maria

Trump Agenda Is Beset by Opposition on Many Fronts; Scope of opposition so early in his term is remarkable for a new president,"Even George W. Bush, who took office after an emotionally contested election decided by the Supreme Court, didn't face massive street protests the day after his inauguration , immediate legal challenges to his executive actions and such extensive attempts to block his cabinet nominations. [...]he is up against a federal bureaucracy including many who are opposed to his efforts, Democrats in Congress, media he has called in a tweet an ""enemy of the American people"" and a nationwide network of liberal activists who have been mobilized by his presidency in a way that they weren't by his campaign. Many of the president's supporters and allies remain optimistic that he will regain his footing and rack up important victories in the future, like confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and passage of tax reform. Democrats' power there is limited, but they have used what clout they have to slow confirmation and intensify scrutiny of Mr. Trump's cabinet nominees, including Labor Secretary designee Andy Puzder, who eventually withdrew his name from consideration in the face of dwindling Senate support. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit that produced the first judicial ruling against the Trump policy. Another source of legal opposition to Mr. Trump are the nation's Democratic state attorneys general, who have been coordinating legal strategies including other challenges to the travel ban that have stymied implementation of the policy while the matter is litigated.",1869587938,Newspapers," Hook, Janet

Trump hits reset with friendlier audience,"Starting with a let-Trump-be-Trump news conference on Thursday - in which the president said he wanted to speak directly to the American people without the media filter - Trump sought to regain control of his presidency, insisting that his administration is ""running like a fine-tuned machine"" and blaming any perceived problems on ""fake news"" and Democrats. Trump hired a communications director to ease the burden on his embattled press secretary, and he is interviewing candidates for national security adviser following the hasty departure of Michael Flynn. ""Except for the fact that he doesn't have a big plastic button, this certainly looks like a reset,"" said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, referring to a prop that then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton gave to the Russian foreign minister in 2009. Though Trump claimed at Thursday's news conference that there is ""zero chaos"" in his White House, he acknowledged that Priebus is spending time ""putting out fires"" that he would rather spend working on administration priorities, such as replacing the Affordable Care Act and restructuring the tax code. The president's scripted speech in South Carolina was overshadowed by an Associated Press report on a memo drafted by the Department of Homeland Security that proposed using the National Guard to round up undocumented immigrants - a plan the White House said is no longer on the table.

Lawmakers in both parties air concerns over Trump's behavior,"A growing roster of Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill say they believe President Trump's pugnacious rhetoric and unpredictable behavior threaten to diminish the United States' standing around the world, do real damage to fragile diplomatic relationships and even weaken global stability. Top Republican congressional leaders have sought to curtail intraparty anxiety by noting that while much of what Trump says is unusual and troublesome, in practice, he is actually shaping up as a traditional GOP president. Trump has come under heavy criticism for spearheading a temporary immigration ban on refugees and foreign nationals from seven majority-Muslim nations, which has been temporarily halted by a federal court. Lawmakers in both parties were still reacting Friday and Saturday to Trump's news conference Thursday, when he lashed out against the news media, the intelligence community and his critics - and defended advisers against claims of improper contacts with Russia. ""If this past week's press conference is any indication of how he's going to conduct himself, I actually think it's not just about House Democrats, but my House Republican colleagues: Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he takes comfort in a belief that Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hold more orthodox Republican views on Russia and can influence Trump on that front.",1869645334,Newspapers," Sullivan, Sean

The economy is already pretty great,"Since the second quarter of 2009, the U.S. economy has expanded consistently for almost eight years, a record that is already better than six of the 10 expansions since the 1950s.The main cloud on the horizon, the Trump administration should note, is that a dual stimulus of tax cuts and infrastructure spending could drive growth above its sustainable rate - and that the Fed, perhaps newly populated with Trump appointees, might fail to put the brakes on fast enough.[...]the fourth reason is that productivity seems to be advancing sluggishly.Internet search, free video tutorials, navigation software.[...]productivity growth slows and accelerates in unpredictable cycles, making gloomy forecasts unreliable.An attack on U.S. trading partners won't cut the trade deficit, which is to a large extent a function of the dollar's reserve-currency status, but it will disrupt supply chains, damaging growth further.",1869645350,Newspapers," Mallaby, Sebastian

"'California is a nation, not a state'","California - the most populous state, with nearly 40 million residents - subsidizes other states at a loss, is burdened by a national trade system, doesn't get a fair say in presidential elections, is diverse and disagrees with much of the rest of the country on immigration, is far ahead of other states on environmental policy and, for the most part, is diametrically opposed to Trump's positions. [...]the argument goes, conditions are perfect for the Golden State to secede. The secessionists likened their cause to the legalization of marijuana and same-sex marriage: things that seemed implausible a decade ago but are now the law here. ""People are asking about the new nation's vaccine policy, and I'm asking, 'Are you high?'"" said Karen Sherman, who holds group meetings at the gay dive bar she owns in San Diego. The group points to Silicon Valley billionaires - including Peter Thiel, who backs Trump and recently said he supports secession, and Shervin Pishevar, who tweeted after the election that he would fund a campaign for California to become its own nation. Gov. Jerry Brown (D) vowed that California will continue to push measures to combat climate change and ensure Californians have health insurance coverage regardless of national policy decisions. ""Ballot measures are very tough to pass when they're understandable and you have a relative idea what the consequences are,"" said Bill Carrick, Garcetti's political consultant.

I put people in prison for too long. I had no choice.,"[...]many were; 145 federal crimes still require a minimum sentence, including distribution of narcotics, immigration violations and identity theft, just to name a few.Yet thanks mostly to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, I was often prohibited from assessing a defendant's history, personal characteristics or role in the offense.Beginning in the 1970s, ostensibly to fight the war on drugs, Congress and many states passed legislation (like New York's infamous Rockefeller laws, adopted in 1973) requiring judges to impose harsh minimum sentences for drug offenses.The legislative branch had eliminated judicial discretion in sentencing, and prosecutors in the executive branch decided when to charge a crime that carried a strict minimum punishment.Judicial discretion in sentencing matters. ""Contrary to deterrence ideology and 'get tough' rhetoric,"" says a report from the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that studies criminal punishment, the evidence ""fails to support"" deterrence.Just last year, Sessions blocked the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act - a popular, bipartisan bill that would have reduced mandatory minimums for nonviolent crimes - from coming to a vote.Organizations like the Vera Institute of Justice and the Brennan Center for Justice are at work right now, engaging families and communities to implement programs diverting children from the criminal justice system and working with state and local governments to attack the social problems, centered largely on poverty and race, that drive so many individuals into criminal activity.",1869645372,Newspapers," Scheindlin, Shira A

CEOs Trump,"In the days after Trump's travel ban was issued, more than a dozen top executives at rival companies in Silicon Valley, including Cook, Tesla's Elon Musk, Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, traded a flurry of candid emails to discuss the response, according to sources familiar with the discussions. [...]more than 100 tech CEOs signed an amicus brief against the executive order, which a federal appeals court ruled would remain frozen; Trump is expected to issue a new immigration order. "" ""There's just nothing,"" in scale or swiftness, that has compared to the corporate response to Trump's entry ban, said Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School. A 'public kind of drumbeat' Trump has billed himself as a businessman who could run the country like he does a corporation, and many executives have stood by him, promising new U.S. jobs, expressing confidence about his economic policies, or taking part in a parade of high-profile meetings at Trump Tower or the White House. In recent years, companies signed on to legal briefs supporting same-sex marriage and added their names en masse to letters against state legislation that critics view as discriminatory toward LGBT groups. A few, such as PayPal and Deutsche Bank, even canceled planned business expansions in North Carolina over a bill that blocked transgender people from using the bathroom of their gender identity in government buildings and public schools.

From China to the pinnacle of American science,"The ruling, by judges with the U.S. Patent Office, declared that Zhang's work on living plant and animal cells was sufficiently original to deserve its own protection.The patent dispute was closely followed in the triangle of geography marked by the institute, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Earlier this week, the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine produced a long report on the ethics of gene editing, arguing for extreme caution when dealing with heritable human traits but leaving open the possibility of use to remove disease-causing genes.The Broad, as it is commonly called, put out a statement of opposition, saying the order ""turns its back on one of America's greatest sources of strength: the flow of visitors, immigrants and refugees who have enriched our nation with their ideas, dreams, drive, energy, and entrepreneurship.""In 2011, while a fellow at Harvard Medical School, he learned about this natural bacterial immune system, CRISPR, an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.Bacteria evolved a defense mechanism against viral invaders that would insert genetic material into bacterial DNA.Two other researchers, who would become rivals in the patent case, published the first paper describing the gene-editing technique and applied for patents.[...]she fears the ruling could have a chilling effect on scientific communication.",1869646850,Newspapers," Achenbach, Joel

In a pair of memos, Kelly offered more detail on plans for the agency to hire thousands of additional enforcement agents, expand the pool of immigrants who are prioritized for removal, speed up deportation hearings and enlist local law enforcement to help make arrests. Another new provision would be to immediately return Mexican immigrants who are apprehended at the border back home pending the outcomes of their deportation hearings, rather than house them on U.S. property, an effort that would save detention space and other resources.

"A TALE OF TWO CITIES; WARREN, OHIO, AND JUAREZ, MEXICO; ONE JOB'S JOURNEY; Two workers live 1,800 miles and a border apart. But their connection to one factory job embodies the massive economic shift that has accompanied the rise of free trade.","In the United States, that shift has contributed to the loss of jobs that once helped workers buy homes, pay for health insurance and send children to college. Nobody disputes that the loss of manufacturing has left a bruise in parts of the U.S., especially in places like the Rust Belt, where lower-paying service industry jobs are increasingly replacing middle class factory positions. The period of steepest decline in manufacturing jobs, which fell from 17 million to 11 million between 2000 and 2010, is substantially attributable to the free import of goods manufactured more cheaply in China and increasing reliance on machines to do the jobs humans once did, according to Gordon Hanson, an economist and trade expert at UC San Diego. South of the border, free trade has indeed helped modernize Mexico by creating millions of jobs since the passage of NAFTA, boosting investment flow and helping to diversify the country's manufacturing sector. [...]wages have remained low, so that Mexico remains attractive to manufacturers who might otherwise be tempted to locate in China or elsewhere in Asia. Since NAFTA went into effect, there has been no change in the number of Mexicans living below the poverty line -- more than half. If the United States were to withdraw from NAFTA and start taxing imports from Mexico again, Delphi would continue doing business in Mexico, he said.

"A generational gulf divides Little Saigon; While many elder Vietnam War refugees remain loyal to the GOP, their increasingly liberal descendants see danger in Trump's policies","Steve Tran lifted the lid on the news rack along Little Saigon's Moran Street and exclaimed: ""Great man!"" ""I tell you, this idea he has of keeping out Muslims is the right thing to do,"" said the 80-year-old, a refugee of the Vietnam War. The teenager, an eighth-grader at Emmaus Lutheran School in Alhambra, was born in California, but like most young Vietnamese Americans he is the fruit of the mass exodus out of Vietnam into the U.S. after the war ended in 1975. In Orange County, refugees created the largest population of people of Vietnamese descent outside of of Vietnam: more than 300,000, with thousands of businesses scattered across Westminster, Garden Grove, Fountain Valley and Santa Ana. ""The elders may be openly supporting Trump and the Republicans because they still feel an affinity for the party they view as fighting against the government that took over their homeland,"" said Linda Vo, a professor of Asian American studies at UC Irvine. By contrast, the first generation -- the refugee generation -- was hamstrung by language barriers that limited their interaction with the broader society and other groups, Vo added.

"For mayor, it's a race for clout; A strong reelection win could bolster Garcetti's standing to run for higher office.","Why is Garcetti darting around the city trying to boost his popularity and spending close to $2 million on advertising for a race against no viable opponent?Because it's largely a campaign for political clout.Last month, he broke the longtime mayoral tradition of holding a January news conference with the police chief to publicize crime statistics.Earlier, at First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Adams-Normandie, Garcetti paid tribute to black protesters of the civil rights movement.On a riser behind him, a singer in the choir was wearing a ""Black Lives Matter"" T-shirt, a reminder that protesters have accused Garcetti of tolerating police mistreatment of African Americans.The First AME pastor, the Rev. J. Edgar Boyd, lamented LAPD shootings of African Americans and suggested in an interview that Garcetti ""rekindle his efforts to become sensitized to the voice of the community.""Though Garcetti is the clear front-runner, getting reelected by a huge margin over 10 obscure rivals also would enhance his dominance of L.A. politics and his dealings with the City Council.; PHOTOGRAPHER:",1869651490,Newspapers," Finnegan, Michael

BOOK REVIEW; The power of the printed word; Rigoberto Gonzalez reflects on growing up in a family of immigrant farmworkers,"Not long after, once more members of our extended family joined the migration, 19 of us moved into a tiny apartment in Thermal, Calif., where we didn't have much privacy or personal space for the next few years. The document was a mailer announcing a clearance sale at the furniture store. Attending college as an English major allowed me to find my first work-study job on campus as an English tutor; being an English tutor gave me the confidence to dream of becoming a teacher. There was no turning back once I felt empowered with each new corridor into my identity as an immigrant, a Chicano, a gay man. Learning about the power of reading, about the benefits of nurturing curiosity and providing access to knowledge, I chose to be like that mobile librarian, that kind stranger at the secondhand store, and adopt their missions to encourage reading, reflection and critical thinking. Gonzalez, an award-winning poet and author of a dozen books of prose and poetry, is professor of English at Rutgers-Newark and one of the L.A.

{ THE RUNWAYS }; Politics struts its stuff; New York Fashion Week catwalks become platforms to send a message.,"The tone of several Fashion Week shows was set before the first models hit the catwalk because of the Council of Fashion Designers of America's decision to publicly voice its support for Planned Parenthood by creating large pink buttons roughly the size of a drink coaster with messaging that read, ""Fashion stands with Planned Parenthood."" The message of inclusiveness and acceptance was in evidence well beyond the bandannas, too, most memorably at Christian Siriano's Feb. 11 afternoon show at the Plaza Hotel, where a model drew cheers of approval when she hit the runway in a pink silk, floor-length skirt and a black T-shirt emblazoned with the message, ""People are people."" On Feb. 12, it was Public School's Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne who had the fashion megaphone of the moment, sprinkling their military- and utilitarian-flavored men's and women's collection liberally with political messages including red New Era caps embroidered with the slogan, ""Make America New York,"" an obvious riff on President Trump's red ""Make America Great Again"" caps (even if the sentiment behind the tweaked slogan wasn't quite so obvious) and hooded sweatshirts bearing Michael Jordan's image on the front and the slogan ""We need leaders"" on the back....",1869652630,Newspapers," Tschorn, Adam

Trump Returns to Campaign After a Month in Office,"With just 1,354 days until the next presidential election, Mr. Trump kicked off his re-election campaign here on Saturday with a boisterous, sign-waving, slogan-chanting, patriotic-song-singing rally that lacked only an opponent for him to run against. Gathering thousands of cheering supporters inside an airport hangar, Mr. Trump put aside the stress of Washington governing and returned to the campaign trail, where he reprised many of his greatest-hits themes and lines from last year and drank in the adulation of the crowd. With no Democratic challengers on the horizon -- or anywhere near it -- only a month after he took office, Mr. Trump focused instead on another favorite target, the news media, blaming journalists for any perception that his opening days in office have been less than smooth. The power and prestige of the presidency is unmatched, and when the blue-and-white plane rolled up next to the hangar to the theme song from the Harrison Ford movie ""Air Force One,"" the crowd, estimated by the local police to have numbered about 9,000, exploded.

Little Village quiet amid deportation rumors [Corrected 02/19/2017],"News of this month's immigration raids, coupled with rumors that federal agents were asking people for their documents on sidewalks and at businesses, have kept immigrants from leaving their homes unnecessarily. While the scale of recent arrests was on par with operations conducted under former President Barack Obama, the effect was magnified in Little Village by President Donald Trump's rhetoric about immigration and by his recent executive order that expanded the list of who can be deported. The executive order, as well as viral posts on social media warning people of rumored raids planned for Little Village and Pilsen this weekend, have immigrants limiting their shopping and recreation. Just open the restaurant for one shift?"" Di Paulo, the chamber of commerce's executive director, said businesses are disheartened by people's reluctance to shop.

Fleeing death threats in El Salvador,"The specter of violence is driving increasing numbers of asylum seekers to nearby countries, such as Costa Rica and Mexico, while thousands of others attempt the 2,000-mile journey to the United States. After the threatening phone calls continued, and menacing-looking men started loitering outside the house, Mauricio and his family decided last summer to test the new program created by President Barack Obama that allows Central American children with at least one parent living legally in the U.S. to apply for refugee status while in their home country. The government has estimated that nearly a half-million people are now connected to the gangs -- in a country of just over 6 million. Since 2003, the government has taken what it calls an ""iron fist"" approach to criminal groups, sending soldiers armed with automatic weapons and dressed in black balaclavas into gang-controlled areas. For children like Mauricio, there's was a benefit and a curse of having parents living in the United States: They sent money for nice things, but occasionally you were robbed of those nice things, like when gangsters with knives jumped Mauricio as he got off his school bus in 2015 and demanded he hand over his new sneakers and wristwatch. Photo: El Salvador's gang violence makes it one of the most dangerous places on the planet. The specter of violence has led more than 10,000 young people in Central America to apply to the U.S. program. ; Photo: Police check a man's tattoos for gang affiliation.

A Friend and Former Business Partner Speaks Out Against Donald Trump Over Mexico; Real-estate developer Jorge Pérez says a border wall with Mexico would be 'immoral',"Amid calls for Mexicans to boycott Starbucks Corp., Howard Schultz, the chief executive of the Seattle firm, released a statement in late January saying he favored ""building bridges, not walls with Mexico"" and highlighting Starbucks's 15-year history in Mexico. Last May, as talk of a border wall spurred debate during the presidential campaign, AeroMexico aired an ad showing footage of existing barriers between the U.S. and Mexico and posed the question, ""Borders: Has anything good ever come of them?"" Later, the airline carrier, in which Delta Air Line Inc. has a minority stake, drove home the point that there are ""no borders in the sky."" The two have been friends for more than a decade, and Mr. Pérez's company developed a Trump-branded condo project in Hollywood, Fla., and was involved with Mr. Trump in real-estate deals in Sunny Isles Beach and West Palm Beach, Fla., in Mexico and in South...",1869700193,Newspapers," Whelan, Robbie

Va. Democrats to test GOP incumbents in every Clinton district,"Republican delegates set to face twice as many challengers as in 2015 Buoyed by a wave of progressive activism that began after the election of President Trump, Virginia Democrats plan to challenge 45 GOP incumbents in the deep-red House of Delegates this November, including 17 lawmakers whose districts voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton. [...]at least one Democratic incumbent from Northern Virginia will face a primary challenge, from a local school board member who said Clinton's defeat helped propel her to run. In addition to trying to wrest control of the House, fielding a strong Democratic slate is critical to showing the nation that ""Virginia is shifting and becoming a more progressive state,"" said Del. Charniele Herring (Alexandria), chair of the House Democratic caucus. John Whitbeck, the chairman of the state Republican Party, described the GOP's 16-year majority in the House as ""near insurmountable"" and said his party plans to challenge incumbents in heavily Democratic districts in Arlington and Fairfax this fall, too. In Alexandria, school board member Karen Graf will challenge fellow Democrat and first-term Del. Mark H. Levine for the nomination to represent the very liberal 45th District.

Trump's lawyer pushes Ukraine deal,"President Trump's personal lawyer and a former business associate met privately in New York City last month with a member of the Ukrainian parliament to discuss a peace plan for that country that could give Russia long-term control over territory it seized in 2014 and lead to the lifting of sanctions against Moscow. The occurrence of the meeting, first reported Sunday by the New York Times, suggests that some in the region aligned with Russia have been seeking to use Trump business associates as an informal conduit to a new president who has signaled a desire to forge warmer relations with Russia. The Times reported that Cohen said he left the proposal in a sealed envelope in the office of then-national security adviser Michael T. Flynn while visiting Trump in the White House. Cohen said no federal investigators have contacted him about the dossier, which was widely distributed to Washington...",1869845016,Newspapers," Hamburger, Tom

A city's sanctuary drama,"To the Mexican immigrant and U.S citizen, the move 11 years ago was City Hall acting too radical to score points with Maywood's large immigrant population.Members of the Minutemen Project, an anti-illegal-immigration group that patrols the border, descended on the town, and City Hall was inundated with outraged messages from across the U.S. More than a decade later, President Trump has vowed to crack down on immigrants in the country illegally and threatened to punish sanctuary cities by denying federal funds.In Washington, the House of Representatives tried to pass a law that would have made it a crime to assist immigrants living in the country illegally.Aguirre said he spoke to Velazquez about the idea, and in January 2006 the City Council unanimously passed a resolution to declare itself a sanctuary city.For months the city was mired in heated protests involving white supremacists, Minutemen Project members and anti-immigration groups.[...]I'm in support of our town."" -- ruben.vives@latimes.com Times staff writer Sandra Poindexter contributed to this report.A MAN walks past City Hall in tiny Maywood, which declared itself a sanctuary city in 2006 -- becoming a lightning rod in the national immigration debate.; PHOTOGRAPHER:",1869853556,Newspapers," Vives, Ruben

A Defender of Traditional Republican Foreign Policy Views Chides Trump's Actions,"[...]with the rise of a president who has vowed to shatter the old order, Mr. McCain has emerged as an outspoken defender of longstanding Republican verities on foreign policy and as one of his party's most biting critics of the new commander in chief. Newly re-elected to a six-year term and eager to wield the megaphone that comes with the chairmanship of the powerful Armed Services Committee, Mr. McCain has repeatedly pushed back on the White House's national security policies in its first weeks. ""The principles that Senator McCain has espoused have animated American foreign policy for decades,"" said Richard Fontaine, a former foreign policy adviser to Mr. McCain who currently serves as president of the Center for a New American Security, a policy research center. [...]after weeks in which the White House has blindsided the public, and sometimes much of the government, with executive orders and sent mixed messages on major foreign policy issues, Mr. McCain has let loose.

Justin Amash Emerges as Leading Critic of Fellow Republican Donald Trump; The libertarian congressman uses Twitter to challenge and taunt the president,"While other House Republicans who were skeptical of Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign have since toned down their criticism, Mr. Amash, who has 100,000 Twitter followers, has remained a vocal critic. During the GOP presidential primaries, Mr. Amash supported Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and then Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Amash's continued criticism of Mr. Trump has at times put him at odds with party leaders, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who have taken on the delicate task of recasting some of Mr. Trump's comments to make them more consistent with mainstream Republican thinking. Mr. Amash says he supports congressional investigations into alleged communications between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russian operatives, and on Friday requested an immediate briefing from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation James Comey and Michael Dempsey, the acting Director of National Intelligence.

Conservative Pundit Sebastian Gorka Brings 'Global Jihadist Movement' Theory Into White House; Critics say policy addressing terrorism primarily as a religious problem reinforces notion that U.S. is at war with Islam,"The Strategic Initiatives Group has been described by some U.S. officials and experts as a parallel National Security Council, writing executive orders with relatively little input from policy officials and subject matter experts. To Mr. Watts and some other experts, Mr. Gorka has bundled disparate groups working at cross-purposes--including Islamic State, al Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and Hezbollah--under his single umbrella of global jihad. [...]his insistence that U.S. policy address terrorism primarily as a religious problem, rather than as the result of overlapping factors such as poverty, social immobility, or lack of education, will reinforce the notion that the U.S. is at war with Islam, an idea that two previous presidential administrations strove to combat, his critics say. ""The [Trump] administration's enlistment of Gorka and others who possess, at most, junior-level expertise with these terrorist elements and relevant issues could very well blow up in all our faces,"" said Michael S. Smith II, a Republican counterterrorism specialist who said he voted for Mr. Trump and has advised members of Congress. Students at the Marine Corps University said they enjoyed his classes and Mr. Gorka's personnel file contains no complaints about his course materials or teaching style, said John Sachrison, the chief operating officer of a foundation that raised the money for Mr. Gorka's position.

Parliament debates Trump's visit,"Monday's debate was triggered by a petition - signed by more than 1.8 million people - that called on the British government to cancel the state visit because it would prove embarrassing for the queen.

The Liberal Democrat lawmaker Alistair Carmichael agreed that May got it ""catastrophically wrong"" by offering the state visit so early. Queen Elizabeth II usually hosts one or two state visits a year, made on the recommendation of the British government. Crispin Blunt, head of parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, said that ""dangling"" a state visit over Trump, whose mother was Scottish and an admirer of the queen, ""was a very successful use of the kind of soft power that the U.K. has.""",1870167877,Newspapers," Adam, Karla

Gorka's views on Islam drive Trump'security agenda,"Today, the former national security editor for the conservative Breitbart News outlet occupies a senior job in the White House and his controversial ideas - especially about Islam - drive Trump's populist approach to counterterrorism and national security. Only days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, President George W. Bush insisted the terror strikes had ""violated the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith. [...]the terrorism problem has nothing to do with repression, alienation, torture, tribalism, poverty, or America's foreign policy blunders and a messy and complex Middle East. 'The Islamic laws of war' Gorka's ideas about radical Islam began with his father's fight against the communists in his native Hungary and his deep Catholic faith. ""Yes, it was jihadi terrorism ... but, more importantly, that event was linked to communism. Because al-Qaeda, ISIS, all of these groups are totalitarians - either you surrender to them or they will kill you."" ""Because when you take seven minutes on a video to decapitate another human being by manually sawing off their head, that's the power that religion can have or a distortion of religion or whatever you want to call it. .. At the Pentagon and the State Department, senior officials scrambled to figure out who he was and what his populist foreign policy views might mean for America's approach to the Muslim world and counterterrorism. In the first hours after the troubled rollout of the president's executive order on immigration and refugees, the White House dispatched Gorka to defend the move...",1870168041,Newspapers," Jaffe, Greg

General picked as security adviser,"Flynn's replacement led troops in Iraq McMaster is outspoken, widely respected strategist President Trump on Monday named Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster as his new national security adviser, replacing the ousted Michael Flynn - a move meant to help put the White House on firmer footing after missteps on multiple fronts. In tapping McMaster, Trump turned to a widely respected and fiercely outspoken military strategist who was recognized for his battlefield leadership during both the Persian Gulf War and the Iraq War. The president has pledged to issue a new executive order this week replacing his court-frozen directive on immigration, which has come to symbolize his struggle to translate ambitious campaign promises into policy. The national security adviser, part of the senior White House staff, serves as the chief in-house counselor to the president on national security issues and has traditionally sought to play the role of a broker among agencies. McMaster will assume the position at a time of widespread security challenges, including Russia's alleged meddling in last year's election and North Korea's ballistic missile test this month. The conversation happened the day the Obama administration announced measures against Russia to retaliate for what U.S. intelligence services say was the Kremlin's efforts to influence November's presidential election.",1870168312,Newspapers," Wagner, John

A Surprising Salve for New York's Beleaguered Cities: Refugees,"Local businesses have found cheap, willing labor in the rolling stocks of refugees, while resettlement agencies have used federal funding to assist with their assimilation, creating work for everyone from refrigerator sellers to house painters. Other critics, while less hyperbolic, note the new arrivals often cost the government money in the form of food stamps, cash assistance and Medicaid benefits, as many begin new lives here below the poverty line. Long a jumping-off point for immigrants, the neighborhood has more than 500 previously empty homes occupied by refugee families, according to State Assemblyman Sean Ryan, a Democrat who represents the area. The West Side Bazaar, ""an international small-business incubator"" teeming with food stands, does a healthy business, as does a local grocery offering fruits, vegetables and ""worldwide money transfer."" Groups say donations and volunteerism are up.) Eva M. Hassett, the executive director of the International Institute of Buffalo, another resettlement agency, says she fears that the changes proposed by the new administration would imperil the city's longstanding reputation for welcoming newcomers, something that dates back to waves of Italian, Irish and Eastern European immigrants who followed the trains and canals west in the 19th and 20th centuries. Mohsen Daghooghi, an Iranian postdoctoral fellow researching computational fluid mechanics at the University at Buffalo, found himself suddenly separated from his wife and 6-month-old son when they were recently denied re-entry to the United States after a trip to visit family in Iran.

"TV Blares, Trump Repeats and Sweden Gasps","Just like that, without white papers, intelligence reports, an interagency meeting or, presumably, the advice of his secretary of state, the president started a dispute with a longtime American friend that resented his characterization and called it false. While aides sought to clarify that Mr. Trump's remarks were about a rising tide of crime in general, rather than any particular event or attack, the president chose to escalate. NOT!"" Sweden's prime minister, Stefan Lofven, responded hours later at a news conference, noting that Sweden ranks highly on international comparisons of economic competitiveness and human development. Mr. Trump reportedly lit into Australia's prime minister over refugees in a telephone call that was said to have ended abruptly. The Fox News segment featured an interview with Mr. Horowitz, whose short film, ""Stockholm Syndrome,"" depicted Sweden as a place where rape and violence have been on the rise since it began accepting more refugees from Muslim countries. Critics of Sweden's migration policies have pointed to a Facebook post on Feb. 3 by a police officer, Peter Springare, who said that migrants were taxing Sweden's pension, education and health systems and that they were the principal culprits in assaults.",1870178702,Newspapers," Baker, Peter

Targeting consumer protections,"Republicans are serving notice that their priority is making businesses happy at the expense of consumers who, if the bills become law, once again will be largely on their own in dealing with questionable or unfair corporate practices. (The U.S. Appeals Court in Washington said last week that it would revisit an earlier ruling declaring the agency's structure unconstitutional.) Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is preparing a bill that would cripple the bureau's authority to bring cases against financial institutions and eliminate databases of consumer complaints. The proposed rule for dispute settlement would block financial firms from using mandatory arbitration as a way to avoid class-action lawsuits. A 2007 study by Public Citizen found that over a four-year period, arbitrators ruled in favor of banks and credit card companies 94% of the time in disputes with California consumers. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) said in a statement that Republican lawmakers have declared war on consumer protection.",1870182083,Newspapers," Lazarus, David

Our immigrant deficit,"Since 2008, more Mexicans have left the U.S. than have come here -- a net loss of 140,000 migrants, according to calculations by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center through 2014.Economists theorize that migration is primarily a function of labor supply and demand.[...]wages, too, are dependent on the supply and demand for workers.During the past few decades, Mexico's labor supply has been large relative to the U.S., especially for jobs Americans didn't much want to do, such as agricultural field work and some kinds of construction.Part of the reason for that perception is the fact that the supply of labor in Mexico is dwindling and wages are rising there.Credit: Jennifer Dabbs Sciubba is associate professor of international studies at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tenn., and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, specializing in the political implications of demographic trends.",1870182350,Newspapers," Jennifer Dabbs Sciubba

"Bringing migrant voices to House race; Most candidates in the state's 34th district have immigrant roots, and the winner would serve under Trump.","State Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez tells the story of how his father worked as a bracero, or manual laborer, in the 1960s, then married and raised kids in Mexico before moving his family to the U.S. Vanessa Aramayo was raised mostly by her mother, a Mexican immigrant who worked for years at factory jobs before saving enough money to open a restaurant with her six sisters. In Highland Park and Eagle Rock in particular, professionals and members of the creative class have moved in, bringing with them yoga studios, craft beer stores and gourmet restaurants that coexist next to the accountants' offices and printing shops that have been there for decades.

JOHN J. STAMOS: 1924-2017,"John J. Stamos spent close to four decades working as a judge and as a Cook County prosecutor, rising to serve first as Cook County state's attorney during turbulent times in the 1960s and then as a justice first on the Illinois Appellate Court and then on the Illinois Supreme Court. Several months later, however, Stamos accepted a judicial nomination to serve on the state Appellate Court's First District, and he won election to the post in November 1968. The winner, Seymour Simon, had been the Cook County Board president who had backed Stamos as state's attorney almost a decade and a half earlier. [...]in 1988, after Simon announced plans to step down from the state high court before the end of his term, Stamos beat out 25 other contenders -- including four other Illinois Appellate Court justices -- to win appointment by Supreme Court justices to the vacancy. While on the state Supreme Court, Stamos authored what is known as the Himmel decision, which mandated that lawyers report all forms of lawyer misconduct to the appropriate disciplinary authority. Stamos initially planned to run for a full 10-year term to the Cook County seats on the Illinois Supreme Court in...",1870201630,Newspapers," Goldsborough, Bob

Churches weighing their sanctuary status,"Alarmed by President Donald Trump's campaign proposals to crack down on immigration and subsequent executive orders that called for barring refugees and expediting deportations, hundreds of churches, synagogues and mosques nationwide -- and about two dozen in the Chicago area -- are considering the bold move to provide sanctuary to immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally. ""When Trump was elected, it turned into an immediate priority situation,"" said the Rev. Beth Brown, pastor of Lincoln Park Presbyterian Church, the first Chicago house of worship since the election to offer immigrants who are facing deportation a place to stay.The targeted immigration enforcement tactics ""go against the grain of what our faith traditions teach us,"" said the Rev. Noel Andersen of the New York-based Church World Service, which tracks the sanctuary movement.According to Andersen, 250 congregations nationwide signed up to help shield immigrants after raids in 2014.In the past, it defied the denomination by inviting an openly gay man to serve as a pastor and by ordaining gay elders, and fought with neighbors who sued to keep a homeless shelter out of the church's basement.[...]providing sanctuary has been part of the DNA here,"" she said.Photo: Lincoln Park Presbyterian Church's Rev.

[...]Republicans say there is a degree of consternation with Mr. Mattis in the White House, partly because of his desire to install in key Pentagon posts Democrats or Republicans who were critical of Mr. Trump during the campaign. In Abu Dhabi, asked if the U.S. was interested in seizing Iraqi oil fields, an idea that Mr. Trump had toyed with publicly during the campaign and again at a speech at CIA headquarters the day after his inauguration, Mr. Mattis dismissed the idea .

"Trump Administration Tightens Deportation, Detention Rules; Homeland Security memos say almost anyone living in the U.S. illegally is subject to removal","Memos issued by the Department of Homeland Security flesh out a pair of executive orders signed last month by President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration. Together, the memos amount to major changes, both at the border with Mexico and in the interior of the U.S. The policy calls for enlisting local authorities to enforce immigration law, jailing more people while they wait for their hearings and trying to send border crossers back to Mexico to await proceedings, even if they aren't Mexican. The order specifies that the wall should be planned for ""the most appropriate locations"" and that officials should use ""appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve illegally, while other longer-term residents who were found to have been in the country illegally could have their cases heard in an immigration court. Because such courts are severely backlogged, the effect has been that many people get to stay in the U.S. for an extended period. Homeland Security will now seek to enlist local law enforcement for help on immigration law at the Mexican border, in addition to the cooperation some provide in the rest of the country.

[...]if you go back in our country's history, our country hated the idea of having a central bank because it seemed mysterious and it seemed like all this power was concentrated in these select few individuals. [...]that's why we have a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., with seven representatives that are appointed by the president of the United States, and we have 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks scattered around the country and the presidents of those Reserve Banks - I'm one of them - are appointed by a local board of directors, and we report to that board of directors. [...]together, the 12 presidents and the seven governors in Washington ultimately set monetary policy for the country. [...]let me just talk - a couple of the big policy issues that I've been focused on since I joined the Minneapolis Fed, and then we'll open it up to you and we'll hear what's on your mind, what questions are most interesting to you, and I'll do my best to try to answer them. The problem was, if we had allowed the financial system to collapse, instead of the Great Recession, we would have been looking at the Great Depression.

Officials defend border ramp-up,"Federal officials cautioned that many of the changes detailed in a pair of memos from Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly will take time to implement because of costs and logistical challenges, and that Border Patrol agents and immigration officers will use their expanded powers with care and discretion. Yet the official public rollout of Kelly's directives, which were first disclosed in media reports over the weekend, was met with outrage from immigrant rights advocates over concerns that the new policies will result in widespread abuses as authorities attempt to fulfill President Trump's goal of tightening border control. The new guidelines, intended to be a road map toward implementing a pair of executive actions Trump signed last month, call for hiring thousands of additional enforcement agents, expanding the pool of immigrants who are prioritized for removal, speeding up deportation hearings and enlisting local law enforcement to help make arrests. The Trump administration ""is using the specter of crime to create fear ... in the American community about immigrants in order to create an opening to advance the indiscriminate persecution of immigrants,"" said Clarissa Martinez-de-Castro, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza. [...]the number has held steady in recent years at just over 11 million, after peaking in 2007 at about 12.2 million, according to a report last fall from the Pew Research Center.",1870421802,Newspapers," Nakamura, David

"After delay, Trump denounces racism, anti-Semitism","The appearance stood in stark contrast to the flashes of irritation he showed at a news conference last week at the White House, when he dismissed questions from reporters about his outreach to African American political leaders in Washington and his lack of response to a sharp increase in anti-Semitic incidents across the country. The differing responses come as calls have been growing for Trump to respond to a wave of bomb threats directed against Jewish community centers in multiple states on Monday, the fourth in a series of such threats this year, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Spicer pointed out that during his visit to the African American history museum, Trump had viewed an exhibition featuring the speeches of Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), the civil rights leader with whom Trump feuded last month over Lewis's refusal to attend his inauguration. Yet Trump's critics point to a larger pattern, including his hesitation at denouncing former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who has repeatedly pledged his support to Trump since Trump began his campaign in June 2015. ""Tone matters, but tone is just empty talk if there's no movement in the right direction of those indicators of quality of life,"" said Ken Blackwell, a former secretary of state of Ohio and a former domestic policy adviser for the Trump presidential transition.",1870422430,Newspapers," Phillip, Abby

"After Trump Remark, an Unpleasant Echo","The episode drew scrutiny worldwide because of Mr. Trump's assertions -- based on a Fox News segment -- that Sweden had experienced a surge in crime and violence as a result of taking in large numbers of refugees. Right-wing news media in the United States and elsewhere have insisted that Sweden is covering up evidence of migrant-related crime -- a claim officials in this prosperous Scandinavian nation, which has a long humanitarian tradition, have rejected. Lars Bystrom, a police spokesman, said the police were summoned at 8:18 p.m. on Monday to the transit station in Rinkeby, about seven miles northwest of Stockholm's City Hall, after officers made a drug-related arrest and were set upon by residents. Asked whether there was enough of a police presence in Rinkeby, Mr. Bystrom cited the district police chief, Niklas Andersson, in describing police resources in the area as plentiful. Benjamin Dousa, 24, an appointed member of a local board in Rinkeby that distributes public money for schools, social services, parks and recreation, and elder care, wrote in an opinion essay that Mr. Trump's critique had some merit.

White House clears way for far more deportations; Homeland Security chief implements Trump's order to end most limits on removing anyone in the U.S. illegally.,"In a pair of memos, Homeland Security Secretary John F.

With the new guidelines, Trump took a significant step closer to realizing his and top aides' vision for reducing the immigrant population in the U.S. Though Kelly emphasized that immigration officers should focus first on deporting convicted criminals or those charged with crimes, his directives nonetheless unleashed deportation officers to conduct more raids in immigrant communities, detain people who don't have criminal convictions and remove people for minor infractions such as driving without a license. ""No matter how much they deny it, it is clear that the White House is setting in motion their mass deportation plan, directing immigration agents to round up and quickly deport anyone who is undocumented,"" Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. [...]more than 8,000 immigrants with criminal records have been released in the last three years.

Ruses by immigration agents come under fire; Posing as local police raises legal and ethical questions,"[...]it has reignited long-simmering objections from immigrant rights attorneys and advocates, who say the scene illustrates unethical -- and, in some cases, illegal -- ruses ICE agents have used for years, portraying themselves as officers from local police departments to ensnare people or fool them into revealing the whereabouts of family members. The use of the tactic, critics said, is particularly egregious in heavily immigrant cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, where police and elected officials have tried for decades to distinguish their cops from federal immigration agents in an effort to convince immigrants living illegally in their cities that they can interact with local police without fear of deportation. ""There is something fundamentally unfair about ICE exploiting local and state policies that are trying to improve public safety by promoting immigrants' trust in law enforcement,"" said Frances Miriam Kreimer, senior attorney at Dolores Street Community Services in San Francisco. In one case, ICE agents in Los Angeles identified themselves as police detectives to the mother of Luis Enrique Cruz Estrada, saying her son had information regarding the whereabouts of a person they wanted to find, according to attorney Jennie Pasquarella, director of immigrants' rights for the American Civil Liberties Union of California. In Los Angeles, where a recent Pew study estimated the population of people in the country illegally at 375,000, Police Chief Charlie Beck and Mayor Eric Garcetti have gone to significant lengths to advocate for the rights of immigrants and distance the LAPD's work from...",1870485207,Newspapers," Rubin, Joel

BACK STORY; 5 things to watch in Mexico; Two members of Trump's team are headed for talks at a frosty moment,"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly are heading to Mexico this week for high-stakes talks with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and other top officials. During a subsequent phone call aimed at mending differences, Trump threatened to send U.S. troops into Mexico to stop ""bad hombres down there,"" according to the Associated Press. Since his inauguration Jan. 20, Trump has announced plans for a new 20% tax on Mexican imports as well as mass deportations of immigrants living illegally in the U.S. -- the majority of whom are Mexican. The economy Trump is convinced that the U.S. and Mexico have an unfair economic relationship because the U.S. has a trade deficit with its southern neighbor. Immigration On Tuesday, the Trump administration called for a vast crackdown on illegal immigration, clearing immigration agents to target any of the 11 million people in the U.S. illegally for removal, instead of only those who have been convicted of a crime. Mexico will also probably seek clarification on a memo published Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security that suggests U.S. authorities want to send some Central American immigrants back to Mexico, rather than to their home...",1870485347,Newspapers," Linthicum, Kate

More Immigrants Face Deportation Under New Rules,"Documents released on Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security revealed the broad scope of the president's ambitions: to publicize crimes by undocumented immigrants; strip such immigrants of privacy protections; enlist local police officers as enforcers; erect new detention facilities; discourage asylum seekers; and, ultimately, speed up deportations. The new enforcement policies put into practice language that Mr. Trump used on the campaign trail, vastly expanding the definition of ""criminal aliens"" and warning that such unauthorized immigrants ""routinely victimize Americans,"" disregard the ""rule of law and pose a threat"" to people in communities across the United States. [...]department personnel shall make full use of these authorities."" [...]that was already the policy under the Obama administration, which instructed agents that undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes were the priority for deportation. In the documents released on Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security is directed to begin the process of hiring 10,000 immigration and customs agents, expanding the number of detention facilities and creating an office within Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help families of those killed by undocumented immigrants.",1870485351,Newspapers," Shear, Michael D

Nazi laws had U.S. roots; Hitler looked to racist American statutes in his push for an Aryan state.,"The European far right sees much to admire in the United States, with political leaders such as Marine Le Pen of France and Geert Wilders of the Netherlands celebrating events -- such as the recent presidential election -- that seem to bode well for their brand of ethno-nationalism. [...]they developed American racial classifications, some of which deemed any person with even ""one drop"" of black blood to belong to the disfavored race. [...]they were well aware that America had strong egalitarian traditions, and many of them predicted that American race law would prove inadequate to stem the rising tide of race-mixing. At a crucial 1934 planning meeting for the Nuremberg system, the justice minister presented a memorandum on American law. According to a transcript, he led a detailed discussion of miscegenation statutes from all over the United States.

Issa faces up to crowd outside Vista office; The congressman spends time answering questions from regular protesters as Trump backers show support.,"Telling supporters and protesters gathered outside his Vista office that calm and civil discourse is what America needs now more than ever, U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa spent nearly 90 minutes Tuesday morning answering a wide range of questions about the controversial policies of President Trump. The Republican's impromptu appearance came after weeks of public criticism from many constituents who have held protests outside his office each Tuesday accusing him of failing to hear their concerns about Trump's immigration policies and the repeal of Obamacare, among other things, and demanding a face-to-face meeting. Issa said Trump's emergency travel ban was flawed and that it's important that the administration craft a replacement executive order that would ""be vetted in advance, that myself as a senior member of [the] Foreign Affairs [Committee] have input into it, and that we can in fact make sure that we keep America safe, but we also keep...",1870485593,Newspapers," Jones, J Harry

LETTERS; Praising the 'enemy',"A Times survey published on Dec. 6, 1943, asked readers, ""Do you favor a Constitutional Amendment after the war for the deportation of all Japanese from this country, and forbidding further immigration?"" Another question: ""Would you permanently exclude all Japanese from the Pacific Coast states, including California?"" The other survey questions were similarly egregious and served to promote the belief that all Japanese Americans were guilty for the attack on Pearl Harbor. Re ""In Congress, Republicans are starting to fret,"" Feb. 18 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has accused the Democrats of unprecedented obstructionism because they were performing their constitutional duties of asking for financial and ethical screening of Cabinet nominees. Have we forgotten that right when President Obama took office in 2009, the Republican leadership in Congress planned a no-honeymoon strategy of all-out resistance to Obama, even though the country was in an economic meltdown? Under the Obama administration, it was more important for the Republicans to regain the White House than to rescue the country from economic disaster.

Justices divided over border shooting; The Supreme Court weighs whether the family of a Mexican teen can sue the U.S. agent who killed him.,"Supreme Court justices debated border shootings and drone strikes Tuesday in a case that could preview the legal battle over President Trump's proposed ban on foreign travelers from certain Muslim-majority countries. The eight justices sounded evenly split over whether the parents of a Mexican teenager could sue the U.S. Border Patrol agent who shot and killed him as he stood on the Mexican side of the border. At issue is whether the Mexican family can invoke the Constitution's protections against excessive force and for due process of law to restrain the conduct of the American agent, or whether U.S. law stops at the border. In suits contesting Trump's now-frozen travel ban, lawyers have claimed the executive order violates the due process rights of foreign travelers, some of whom are in this country and others who have never been here.

Donald Trump's Australia,"In the days after President Trump's ban on immigrants from several Muslim countries, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia spent a lot of time saying nothing. Australia refuses to allow them on Australian soil out of a belief that doing so would restart a flood of boats toward our shores, and rejected the offer of New Zealand, which has open borders with Australia, to resettle them for the same reason. Mr. Trump's gravitational pull is visible in the resurgence of the far-right, nationalist One Nation Party, which wants not only to ban Muslim immigration, but also to convene a commission to determine if Islam is a religion or political movement. [...]Pauline Hanson, the One Nation Party leader, tweeted that Mr. Trump's policy was ""a good start, but I would go further."" Shunting asylum seekers offshore bolsters public confidence in our migration system, which preserves our tolerance of the migrants who are here. [...]it may also be true that when you spend 15 or so years deriding asylum seekers as ""illegals"" or ""queue jumpers,"" describing their arrival as a ""peaceful invasion"" or warning they might be terrorists, it all lodges in the public imagination.",1870487186,Newspapers," Aly, Waleed

Major Elements of Trump's New Immigration Policies,"With an executive order last month and a pair of Department of Homeland Security memos on Tuesday, the Trump administration has significantly hardened the country's policies regarding illegal immigration. In practice, the government has used this process, called ""expedited removal,"" relatively narrowly because of concerns about whether it violates constitutional rights of due process that are granted to anyone in the United States, regardless of immigration status. Since 2002, expedited removal has been applied only to immigrants who have been in the country less than two weeks and were caught within 100 miles of the border. ""Someone could be living in Chicago for a year and a half and then be swept off the street by an ICE agent,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the A.C.L.U.'s Immigrants' Rights Project, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Unlike other border crossers, whom border patrol agents may deport without a legal hearing, these children must appear before an immigration judge and be interviewed by an asylum officer. The source of this caution is none other than John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, who told lawmakers this month that he did not believe it would be possible to hire the desired 15,000 ICE and border patrol agents in the next couple of years. A previous surge in hiring under President George W. Bush resulted in dozens of corruption cases, with Border Patrol and other agents accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.",1870579426,Newspapers," Kulish, Nicholas

Border Wall Faces Resistance From Texas Republicans; Officials want a mix of fencing and more personnel along winding Rio Grande where most land is privately owned,"Many Texas Republicans say a better approach mixes additional fencing and more personnel, as well as better technology to monitor the state's southern boundary, which is marked by the winding Rio Grande River and in vast stretches by formidable natural barriers. On Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) toured the Texas border area, accompanied by Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas), who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee and also opposes an end-to-end barrier. To build there, the government probably would have to sue landowners to seize the land through eminent domain. [...]to comply with international treaties that safeguard the Rio Grande's flow and divvy up its precious water, a joint U.S.-Mexican commission must approve any construction along its banks. Dennis Nixon, a top Texas fundraiser for Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, sits just 1,000 yards from the river in his office at the International Bank of Commerce in Laredo, where he is president. [...]the Customs and Border Patrol agency wound up jettisoning 15 segments of fencing it had originally planned to build, said Rowdy Adams, a retired senior Border Patrol official who oversaw parts of the project.

"Economist, Nobel winner spurred advances in various fields","Kenneth J. Arrow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and mathematical theorist who made seminal contributions to social sciences as varied as election theory and health economics and was one of the most influential economists of his generation, died Feb. 21 at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. Dr. Arrow, who spent most of his career at Stanford University as an economics professor, was the youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize in economic sciences. Dr. Arrow came from a prodigious family of economists that includes his nephew Lawrence H. Summers, president emeritus of Harvard University, former treasury secretary and former director of the White House National Economic Council; and his late brother-in-law Paul A. Samuelson, the first American to win the Nobel Prize in economics, in 1970. Health-care economics Dr. Arrow also laid the foundations of modern health economics by identifying the special market characteristics of and issues surrounding health-care markets, as well as the underlying problems of the medical insurance industry, in his influential 1963 paper ""Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care."" ""The customer cannot test the product before consuming it, of innovation and new ideas; risk aversion, an economics and finance concept based on human behavior when exposed to uncertainty; and information economics, the study of how information and information systems affect the economy. Dr. Arrow served on President John F. Kennedy's White House Council of Economic Advisers alongside economists and future Nobel laureates James Tobin and Robert Solow and taught economics at Harvard from 1968 to 1979....",1870815588,Newspapers," McDonough, Megan

Gov. Pence couldn't bar Syrian refugees. Now Trump administration tries.,"INDIANAPOLIS - Flow of people fleeing war zone continues to reach Indianapolis INDIANAPOLIS - When the Trump administration unveiled an executive order trying to bar Syrian refugees from coming to the United States, many who have resettled here in the American heartland felt a familiar sense of dread: Exodus Refugee Immigration and the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana sued Pence, asserting that he did not have constitutional authority to bar people from the state. Pence lost, with a federal appeals court ruling in October that the governor's directive was ""discrimination on the basis of nationality."" [...]it has rocked the small Syrian community in Indianapolis, a city that is home to a fast-growing immigrant population, including a growing number of refugees - a blue dot smack in the middle of a deeply red state. At least one Syrian family did not come to Indianapolis because of Trump's order, but another arrived recently after a federal appeals court struck down the administration's decree. Refugees from Syria are subject to an enhanced security review, a process that can take years and includes numerous interviews, biometric checks, medical screening and security checks by multiple federal agencies. After nine vetting interviews where he was asked ""every single detail"" about his life, the United States granted him refugee status.

"In Va., a freshman Republican holds court amid a rowdy anti-Trump crowd","Questioners in the audience of roughly 750 people pressed Rep. Scott W. Taylor (Va.), a former state lawmaker and Navy SEAL, on President Trump's connections to Russia and the specifics of what pieces of the Affordable Care Act he wants to keep. Yet by the end of the session, Taylor felt that he had weathered the evening's storm, which was a more civil event than a boisterous town hall meeting the previous evening down the road in Virginia Beach, where he had drawn a crowd of 800. Whether his optimism is warranted is a key question for both Republicans and Democrats as they navigate a wave of anti-Trump hostility in dozens of congressional town hall gatherings nationwide this week. If Democrats hope to win back control of the House and the Senate, they must keep pressure on Republicans and channel the energy of these hostile crowds into a political movement that will vote in next year's midterm elections. [...]if Republicans hope to survive, as Taylor thinks he did Tuesday, they must figure out how to work with Trump while navigating constituent anger about his more controversial policies, including a rocky attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and an immigration...",1870815926,Newspapers," Kane, Paul

Kelly brought President Trump's promised crackdown on illegal immigration one step closer to reality.Among their first targets could be the more than 940,000 people who already have a final order of removal from an immigration judge and have either refused to leave or were allowed to stay temporarily, often because of the hardship their deportation would cause to family in the U.S. Has the Trump administration already increased deportations?[...]deportation totals fell to about 240,000 last year.[...]the Homeland Security Department will expand a program in which local police help capture those violating immigration laws.Kelly instructed immigration officials to expand the number and size of detention facilities to hold people awaiting hearings in immigration court as well as those seeking asylum.Homeland Security officials say they are working with the Mexican government violent criminal convictions.[...]more than 8,000 immigrants with criminal records have been released in the last three years.Kelly has told lawmakers that Homeland Security will fill in gaps with ground sensors, surveillance blimps and other technologies that help detect illegal border crossings.",1870827320,Newspapers," Bennett, Brian

Voters across U.S. overrun town halls; They vent anger at Republicans at district meetings -- when the lawmakers are brave enough to hold them.,"About 900 people showed up in an auditorium at the fairground in Mariposa, a small tourist way station on the road to Yosemite, for Elk Grove Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's town hall.[...]about a third or so of the crowd appeared strongly supportive of the president.) For Rep. Buddy Carter, a two-term GOP lawmaker representing a staunchly conservative stretch of coastal Georgia, the boos began as soon as he tried to present plans to replace the current healthcare law.More than 300 people, many wearing Planned Parenthood T-shirts and waving pink and purple paper hearts, squeezed into a college auditorium in Savannah for the standing-room-only event.An earlier round of town halls this month produced a number of screaming spectacles, prompting many Republican lawmakers to scrub their latest recess schedules of any such face-to-face encounters.Some skittish GOP lawmakers skipped meeting with constituents altogether; in California, the liberal group Indivisible circulated milk cartons bearing the word ""Missing"" and the face of Republican Rep. Paul Cook, a three-term congressman from the southeastern desert.Jennifer Bruns, 49, joined her husband and their two teenage sons at Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider's suburban Chicago town hall, which vastly overflowed the 225-seat Northbrook Public Library.(Trump weighed in via Twitter: ""The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists.",1870827661,Newspapers," Barabak, Mark Z

HIGHER EDUCATION; Failing to apply for college aid; Fewer students are seeking help through the California Dream Act. Are deportation fears the reason?,"Fears about heightened enforcement of federal immigration laws combined with confusion and anti-immigrant rhetoric might be causing thousands of California students who came to the United States without legal papers to forgo valuable college aid.Far fewer students than last year have applied for financial aid through the California Dream Act so far this year, and advocates are trying to encourage them to do so before the March 2 deadline.On Tuesday, the California Department of Education published a letter urging students to apply, and promised to protect student information to ""the fullest extent of the law.""The California Dream Act allows students who are in the U.S. illegally to apply for the same financial aid packages available to others.Officials believe that students are applying in lower numbers because they're scared of being identified as lacking legal status in the current climate, when their news feeds are full of stories about Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.[...]on Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security released new guidelines that empower immigration enforcement officers to target any of the 11 million people in the U.S. illegally.",1870827772,Newspapers," Resmovits, Joy

Trump deputies seek to repair ties with Mexico,"John F. Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, was expected to join him later in the day in a bid to repair the once-close relationship, which began deteriorating when President Trump repeatedly criticized Mexico during his election campaign. The policy calls for using local and state authorities to enforce federal immigration laws, deporting even people who commit minor crimes, jailing more people while they await deportation hearings and trying to send illegal border crossers back to Mexico even if they aren't Mexican. Some Mexican officials also have countered with threats to end cooperation on joint efforts that target drug trafficking, illegal immigration and organized crime. Deare had complained to scholars during a private session at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington that foreign policy was too tightly controlled by Kushner and Trump's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, according to one of the people who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussion was private. In Mexico, Trump's antagonism, along with discontent with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, is fanning flames of renewed nationalism and stoking the prospects of leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in the next presidential election. -- tracy.wilkinson@latimes.com patrick.mcdonnell@latimes.com Cecilia Sanchez in...",1870827901,Newspapers," Wilkinson, Tracy

"Plan to boost deportations worries some employers; California, where 10% of workers are undocumented, would be particularly hard hit by the order","Two memos released by Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly on Tuesday directed immigration officers to broaden the scope of their enforcement, conduct more raids of immigrant communities, and detain people living here illegally regardless of whether they had a criminal record.Undocumented workers make up 10% of the labor force in California, USC researchers have estimated, and form a large chunk of the employment that drives massive industries such as agriculture and construction.California growers have been dealing with a persistent lack of qualified laborers for years, he said, partly because of President Obama's tough immigration policies and the recession of 2008, which appears to have prompted a wave of Mexicans to return home for good.The contractor predicted that growers are going to face an even tighter labor market because some immigrant workers will voluntarily head for home.The restaurant industry depends on Latino workers to fill open positions, and the new deportation rules could make it ""more challenging"" to find qualified employees, said Selwyn Yosslowitz, co-founder of Marmalade Cafe, which operates seven restaurants in the Southland and an outlet at LAX.",1870828142,Newspapers," Kitroeff, Natalie

LETTERS; Our good 'citizens',"Arthur G. Saginian Santa Clarita :: The Democrats need to quit fighting congressional battles they don't have the votes to win and start selectively endorsing GOP crusades in a manner that will impact how Republicans vote in Congress. Danger of going soft on crime Re ""From traffic stop to gunfight of their lives,"" Feb. 21 The shooting death of Whittier police Officer Keith Boyer allegedly by a career criminal was not just senseless and avoidable, but also utterly predictable. By conceding the debate on how to best deal with repeat offenders like the former Pelican Bay inmate, by voting for overwhelmingly Democratic majorities in the Legislature and a Democratic governor, by supporting marijuana legalization, and by supporting early-release measures and generally not supporting law enforcement, Californians are getting what we should have expected. Particularly toxic is their falsely equating relentless Republican opposition to President Obama as a political tactic to prevent his reelection with the current resistance of Democrats and much of the public to an administration and a Congress that seem determined to negate every step of economic, social and environmental progress that are supported by strong majorities of the public. Michael Farquhar Altadena :: While I agree that ""rampant polarization and partisanship"" does not bode well for our democracy, I'd be more inclined to tolerate a lecture by Lieberman on the essential role of compromise if he hadn't already compromised his soul away by introducing to the Senate, with lavish praise, the eminently unqualified Betsy DeVos for secretary...",1870828154,Newspapers,," Republican Party

"Migrants Hide, Fearing Capture on 'Any Corner'","[...]with the Trump administration intent on curbing illegal immigration -- two memos outlining the federal government's plans to accelerate deportations were released Tuesday, another step toward making good on one of President Trump's signature campaign pledges -- that threat, for many people, has now begun to distort every movement. How can I designate someone with legal status as my children's guardian if I am deported? ""There's a real fear that their kids will get put into the foster care system,"" said Mary Clark, the executive director of Esperanza Immigrant Legal Services in Philadelphia. [...]we're getting our kids U.S. passports so they can come visit us in Mexico,"" said the man, a stocky restaurant worker in a gray baseball cap, who has lived in Texas for 15 years and declined to give his name. Some low-income families in New York with children who are citizens have declined to re-enroll in a program offering food assistance worth several thousand dollars, said Betsy Plum, director of special projects for the New York Immigration Coalition, an advocacy group. On a good Sunday, the Staten Island tamale restaurant run by Cesar Rodriguez and his mother makes $3,000. Since the start of the year, it has averaged only $1,500, and this past Sunday only $700. The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a nonprofit legal services group in Seattle, has issued thousands of business cards in recent days, advising undocumented immigrants what they should do, or not do, if a law enforcement agent knocks.

Border-Adjustment Tax Divides Energy Sector; Drillers and refiners weigh a key House Republican proposal,"(Feb. 24) The linchpin of a corporate tax overhaul proposed by House Republicans would mark a massive change for the U.S. oil-and-gas industry and has companies frantically studying whether to support it, fight it or stay on the sidelines. Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and an architect of the proposal, met last week with company tax executives at the headquarters of the American Petroleum Institute. Continental Resources Inc., a producer headed by oil man Harold Hamm, who served as an adviser to President Donald Trump, a Republican, during his campaign, has yet to take a position on the proposal or the broader tax package, said Blu Hulsey, the company's vice president of government and regulatory affairs.

Top U.S. Officials Met With Defiance in Visit to Mexico; Secretaries of State and Homeland Security encounter objections to hard U.S. line on deportations,"Mr. Videgaray's declaration spelled trouble for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who a White House official said were sent to ""talk through the implementation"" of Mr. Trump's guidelines. ""The relationship with Mexico is phenomenal right now,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. Mr. Trump's new guidelines, which flesh out executive orders signed by the president last month, call for enlisting local U.S. authorities to enforce immigration law, jailing more people pending hearings, and sending border-crossers back to Mexico to await proceedings, even if they aren't Mexican. In addition to tariff-free cross-border trade, Mexico and the U.S. have collaborated for decades on efforts to fight drug cartels, police the border and prevent terror attacks.

Trump Border Wall Faces Challenges in Southwest States; New Mexico measure barring federal government from acquiring state land is among the potential hurdles,"The Department of Homeland Security in 2006 was granted legal latitude to fence off some borderlands, and the federal government has broad powers to seize land through eminent domain. According to U.S. Census data, New Mexico exported roughly $1.5 billion of goods to Mexico last year, more than three times the value of its Mexican exports in 2010. The bulk of the nearly 2,000-mile U.S. border with Mexico lies along Texas, where the administration is likely to encounter the most difficult obstacles to building a barrier--from the Rio Grande to objections from some within Mr. Trump's own party. A November report from the Congressional Research Service noted there was nothing in current federal law that appeared to bar Homeland Security from expanding construction beyond the existing border fencing as long as it was done ""to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry."" Fights over compensation or procedural challenges could slow the wall's construction, he said, but no property owner in modern times has successfully petitioned a court to stop the federal government from taking land for public use.",1870928001,Newspapers," Frosch, Dan

Producers of the escapist fantasy ""La La Land"" are recasting the movie as a last bastion of free expression; the family animated movie ""Zootopia"" is touting itself as a subversive story about race; and Salmon Rushdie, Gloria Steinem, and Dr. Oz are among the celebrities quoted in a campaign to position ""Lion"" as the most relevant movie in a time of fraught debates over immigration. The invitation invoked the real-life presidential candidates, featuring an elephant in a red tie on one side and a donkey in pearls on the other.

Confessions of a Free-Trade Lobbyist; Business leaders politely clap as the president puts exports at risk. Yet they know 'Fortress America' would be a disaster.,"For the past month there has been a steady stream of business leaders from some of the most successful U.S.-based multinational companies visiting the White House. After a lecture about President Trump's ""Build It Here, Sell It Here, Buy It Here"" doctrine, business leaders seem either to avoid eye contact or nod in agreement by highlighting previously announced U.S. hiring plans. While some Americans say they are willing to pay more for the benefits of protectionism--more jobs sewing clothes and assembling machinery and electronics--their enthusiasm may wane when the negatives on the export side of the ledger kick in. First to be hit would be American farmers and ranchers, who often export a third of their harvest and herds. What's next, jerry-rigging trade statistics to exaggerate the trade imbalance, or maybe giving China unfettered access to Africa by terminating the Africa Growth And Opportunity Act? Or exiting from the multilateral...",1871269706,Newspapers," Lane, Bill

Trump Border Wall Faces Hurdles in Southwest States; New Mexico measure barring federal government from acquiring state land is among the potential hurdles,"The Department of Homeland Security in 2006 was granted legal latitude to fence off some borderlands, and the federal government has broad powers to seize land through eminent domain. According to U.S. Census data, New Mexico exported roughly $1.5 billion of goods to Mexico last year, more than three times the value of its Mexican exports in 2010. The bulk of the nearly 2,000-mile U.S. border with Mexico lies along Texas, where the administration is likely to encounter the most difficult obstacles to building a barrier--from the Rio Grande to objections from some within Mr. Trump's own party. A November report from the Congressional Research Service noted there was nothing in current federal law that appeared to bar Homeland Security from expanding construction beyond the existing border fencing as long as it was done ""to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry."" Fights over compensation or procedural challenges could slow the wall's construction, he said, but no property owner in modern times has successfully petitioned a court to stop the federal government from taking land for public use.",1871290918,Newspapers," Frosch, Dan

Bannon presses 'deconstruction',"nationalist agenda on display at CPAC Trump's top strategist vows daily fight, no compromise The reclusive mastermind behind President Trump's nationalist ideology and combative tactics made his public debut Thursday, delivering a fiery rebuke of the media and declaring that the new administration is in an unending battle for ""deconstruction of the administrative state."" All the opportunities he had to waver off this, all the people who have come to him and said, 'Oh, you've got to moderate' - every day in the Oval Office, he tells Reince and I, 'I committed this to the American people, I promised this when I ran, and I'm going to deliver on this .'"" Bannon and Priebus shared the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference for 25 minutes in a buddy routine that inspired flashbacks to Oscar and Felix in ""The Odd Couple."" Bannon framed much of Trump's agenda with the phrase, ""deconstruction of the administrative state,"" meaning the system of taxes, regulations and trade pacts that the president says have stymied economic growth and infringed upon U.S. sovereignty. Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross was a billionaire investor; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was a hedge fund manager; and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn was president of Goldman Sachs, to cite three. After donning a dress shirt and tie Thursday morning for a White House meeting with corporate executives, Bannon changed into a black shirt (open collared, no tie), black blazer and khakis for his visit to CPAC.

There's no doubt that China's economic boom has caused painful dislocation for many hard-working Americans, and that policies to help those U.S. workers transition to new jobs haven't kept pace. China has also disappointed many of the most buoyant hopes that the country's economic reforms would lead its political system to become more open and democratic. If the United States under Trump stops trying to build a constructive, cooperative relationship with China, it will only become easier for Xi's lieutenants to isolate Chinese liberals from their friends around the world and prevent the next generation of independent reformers and internationalists from engaging with...",1871366834,Newspapers," Gewirtz, Julian

THE NATION; A muddled immigration message; Trump's 'military operation' comment appears to contradict his own aides.,"[...]with White House spokespeople, Cabinet secretaries and immigration officials more willing than the president to acknowledge the far more complicated state of immigration in the U.S., a muddled picture has emerged on where the Trump administration is headed. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tried to reconcile one apparent contradiction between Trump's and Kelly's comments, saying the president meant only that the operation was military-like in its efficiency. In an address to conservative activists outside Washington, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Trump's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, both listed the administration's early approach to immigration as among the most crucial steps Trump has taken. Trump campaigned on what he characterized as a threat to national security posed by criminals illegally crossing the border, especially while President Obama was in office, and his remarks Thursday in the White House's State Dining Room echoed that.

The attorney, Joseph Porta, said that he had been unable to speak to Arreola Robles or an ICE representative and that Arreola Robles' name was not showing up in the online detainee locator system.According to Border Patrol, about 1,500 DACA recipients have been terminated from the program because of a criminal conviction or gang affiliation.Porta said he plans to file documents requesting that Arreola Robles be released on bond until his hearing before an immigration judge.",1871391464,Newspapers," Castillo, Andrea

"REPUBLICAN PARTY; From the basement and onto the ballot; State GOP chair has a rally plan, and it starts in 2018","The state's roads, bridges and dams have fallen into disrepair, poverty is on the rise, middle-class families struggle to afford a decent home, and massive pension liabilities still loom -- all problems that have festered under the watch of Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown and the Democratic-controlled state Legislature, Brulte and other state Republican leaders said.GOP leaders have seen the 2018 election as a potential Republican spring, when years of hard work helping Republicans win seats on city councils, county commissions and local school boards would begin to bear fruit in bigger races.Republican political consultant Steve Schmidt said the GOP's declining voter registration numbers in California spell doom for the party's future prospects in the state. ""Institutionally, it's a third-party entity,"" said Schmidt, who worked for President George W. Bush's 2004 reelection campaign and helped run the 2008 presidential campaign of Republican Sen. John McCain.Progressive activists have showed up at the district offices of Republican members of Congress to protest votes on Trump's Cabinet appointments and plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.With the Democratic Party so focused on the Trump administration, and the need to protect Democratic U.S. senators up for reelection in 2018, the GOP could land some significant victories, he said.CALIFORNIA Republican Party Chairman Jim Brulte, shown at a 2015 party convention, said the state GOP may benefit from Democratic leaders being so preoccupied with Trump that they ignore problems at home.; PHOTOGRAPHER:",1871391496,Newspapers," Willon, Phil

Mexico Weighs Mixed Signals From the U.S.,"Mexico is keenly aware of its leverage in the bilateral relationship: billions of dollars in agricultural purchases by Mexico, a decade of security cooperation to dismantle cartels and intercept drugs destined for the United States, and the detention of hundreds of thousands of migrants passing through Mexico on their way to America's southern border. On trade, putting aside the supply chains of vehicles and electronics engineered by the North American Free Trade Agreement, agriculture is a major vulnerability for the United States. For more than a decade, the Mexican authorities have cooperated in arresting top cartel leaders and intercepting drug shipments destined for the United States. Mr. Kerlikowske said Mexican federal police officers were stationed in Tucson and in Laredo, Tex., where they assist American law enforcement in identifying drug cartels and human smugglers by sharing information in Mexican criminal history databases. [...]American Customs and Border Protection officers are assigned to a joint program in Mexico City, where they share information on possible drug traffickers through the use of American law enforcement databases. Whether policing the southern American border to prevent unwanted migrants from entering the United States or examining passenger manifests to ensure terror-related suspects cannot enter through Mexico, the authorities here have been a critical component of America's national security strategy. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, tried later in the day to clarify the contradiction between Mr. Trump's and Mr. Kelly's remarks.",1871397036,Newspapers," Azam, Ahmed

"Immigrants Face Walls, Deportations and Tighter Rules in Europe, Too","[...]France's highest administrative court ruled against a request from human rights groups to remove Albania, Armenia, Kosovo and Senegal from a list of safe countries to which unsuccessful asylum seekers may be deported. [...]human rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, and a number of national and regional organizations, have accused Europe's governments of being too harsh on migrants who they say are simply seeking a better life or striving to escape war and persecution. When the French authorities broke up a settlement near Calais that had for years had hundreds of migrants, officials ""failed to genuinely consult migrants or asylum seekers or provide them with adequate information prior to the eviction,"" Amnesty International said. In Italy, Marco Minniti, a security expert, became interior minister in December and has pushed through long-awaited measures aimed at curbing immigration by processing asylum applications faster. In 2015, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, was the first European Union leader to resist mass migration. ""Rounding up all men, women and children seeking asylum and detaining them months on end in container camps is a new low in Hungary's race to the bottom on asylum seekers and refugees,"" Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International's deputy director for Europe, said in a statement.",1871397042,Newspapers," Smale, Alison

Fact-Checking Assertions About the President's Travel Ban,"Faced with chaos, confusion and a blow from the courts, the White House has been aggressively defending President Trump's immigration executive order as a constitutional way to keep the country safe while simultaneously working on a revised version that it hopes will clear the legal hurdle. The revised order will retain fundamental elements and will be released ""very soon,"" Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser, said in an interview on Fox News. The Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restrictive immigration, used a Senate subcommittee report to identify 72 people associated with the seven countries targeted by the executive order ""who had been convicted in terror cases."" According to the New America Foundation, all 12 jihadist terrorists who have killed people in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, were American citizens or permanent residents, and none had ties to the seven countries named in Mr. Trump's executive order. Mr. Obama's State Department temporarily stopped processing refugee applications from Iraq in 2011, after two Iraqi refugees living in Bowling Green, Ky., were arrested on charges of trying to send money and supplies to Al Qaeda.

The National Death Wish,"A few weeks ago, Tom Cotton and David Perdue, Republican senators from Arkansas and Georgia, introduced an immigration bill that would cut the number of legal immigrants to this country each year in half, from about a million to about 500,000. If we can reduce the number of low-skill immigrants coming into the country, that will reduce the pool of labor, put upward pressure on wages and bring more Americans back into the labor force. Let's illustrate the point by looking at one portion of the labor market. Nationwide, there are now about 200,000 unfilled construction jobs, according to the National Association of Home Builders. An exhaustive U.S. study by the National Academy of Sciences found that immigration didn't drive down most wages, but it had a ""very small"" and temporary effect on native-born workers without a high school degree.",1871397121,Newspapers," Brooks, David

Michael Novak Crafted a Moral Defense of Democratic Capitalism; Philosopher served as ambassador under Reagan and impressed Thatcher,"Though democratic capitalism had its flaws, ""all other known systems of political economy are worse,"" he wrote in his 1982 paean to the profit motive.

Recruited to teach at Stanford University in the mid-1960s, he joined protests against the Vietnam War, though he wavered over the years on whether U.S. involvement was justified. In 1978, he accepted a job offer from the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank in Washington.

"Trump Says His Victory Marked Win for Conservative Values; At CPAC, president pledges to put U.S. citizens 'first'","President Donald Trump painted his election victory as a ""win for conservative values"" in a speech to activists Friday morning that mixed traditional Republican positions on taxes and regulation with the economic nationalism that propelled him into the White House. The annual CPAC is a rite of passage for Republican congressional leaders, governors, presidential hopefuls--and this time, White House officials. Traditionally, Mr. Trump isn't as natural a fit for the CPAC audience as someone like Mr. Cruz, whose social conservative values and heated campaign against the Affordable Care Act--including prompting a government shutdown to protest its funding--have bolstered his appeal among the conservatives who attend the conference. Mr. Bannon, in a joint appearance with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, blamed reports of internal rivalries and chaos in the administration on an intensifying feud with the media that he vowed would continue as the administration pushes to tighten immigration...",1871576434,Newspapers," Ballhaus, Rebecca

Transcript: WSJ Interview With Atlanta Fed's Dennis Lockhart; President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is retiring at the end of this month,"Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, is retiring at the end of this month after a decade at the central bank. Mr. Lockhart reflected on his policy-making experiences, the financial crisis, the economic effects of an aging population and the likely path for short-term interest rates, among other topics. [...]to be part of the Federal Reserve and the (Federal Open Market Committee) in facing the financial crisis and then grappling with the recession and then nursing the recovery to where we are today, I would not wish that history on the country, but from a personal perspective it is--it definitely met the test of interesting times, to be part of the Federal Reserve. [...]in July and later in 2007, when the subprime mortgage-backed securities market began to unravel, it took people by surprise and took me by surprise. [...]I guess one of the lessons I would--I would take from the whole experience is really that point, and that is that policy makers--or having to try to read the situation with perspective and even with, say, an ability, in a way, to think like a historian, but you're in real time and you're having to make judgments as to what the composite picture actually is telling you, and it is very difficult to see a bubble in real time. [...]much of economics is comparing current circumstances to historical norms in one way or another.

Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama on such issues as bioethics and civil rights; and was chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom for two years. Earlier this month, he and his colleague Angela Wu Howard published an article in the religious magazine First Things criticizing Mr. Trump's executive order banning refugees from Syria and suspending entry by citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries into the U.S. (A revised order is expected soon .) Dr. George became familiar with the country's system for admitting refugees when he advised the State Department on religious freedoms from 2012 to 2016.

A 'Notorious' 2016 for Ginsburg and Comey; The justice's politicking and the FBI director's appropriation of prosecutorial authority likely did lasting damage.,"[...]the ""Greenhouse effect,"" referring to Linda Greenhouse, who covered the justices for the New York Times. The Supreme Court press is increasingly dominated by lawyer-journalists who reflect the change in the composition of law-school faculties, which are now almost uniformly left-activist. Since the press's orientation is sympathetic to activist results, which I think it is safe to say are largely on the left, it is not surprising that the Greenhouse effect is more demonstrable vis-à-vis Republican appointees. There are several possible explanations for Justice Ginsburg's indiscretion, but I am inclined to blame the activist press for turning her head, encouraging her to speak out, whether in judicial opinions or otherwise. To illustrate how far Justice Ginsburg has come, around the time she was considered for the Supreme Court, she publicly criticized Justice Scalia's sharp dissents, as well as an opinion of mine in which I referred to one of her opinions as premised on ""naked analytical bootstrapping."" The Supreme Court is not technically bound by the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, but the justices have said they would conform to the same standards. [...]it is quite improper for a justice to disclose the court's internal discussions, but she certainly implied what Scalia's position on Friedrichs had been in conference.

Donald Trump Rejects Intelligence Report on Travel Ban; Tension with intelligence officials rises as Homeland Security contradicts White House on terror,"An intelligence report by the Department of Homeland Security contradicts the White House's assertion that immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries pose a particular risk of being terrorists and should be blocked from entering the U.S. The report is the latest volley in a struggle between intelligence officials and the Trump administration that has rippled across several agencies.The compilation and disclosure of an intelligence report so directly at odds with top White House priorities marks an unusually sharp rupture between the administration and career public servants. ""Any suggestion by opponents of the president's policies that senior [homeland security] intelligence officials would politicize this process or a report's final conclusions is absurd and not factually accurate.The new DHS report, which is not classified, states that its findings are based on public statistics and reports from the Department of Justice and the State Department as well as an annual report on global threats produced by U.S. intelligence agencies.",1871697087,Newspapers," Harris, Shane

"At CPAC, Trump says his supporters are GOP's future","Cheers at conservative gathering that used to sideline his ideas In a freewheeling speech with echoes of his campaign rallies, President Trump told a gathering of conservative activists Friday that the coalition of voters that narrowly put him in office represents the future of the Republican Party. At one point, when he mentioned Clinton, the crowd, as was often the case at his rallies, started chanting, ""Lock her up!"" ""The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first,"" Trump said at another point, prompting the crowd to chant ""U.S.A.! U.S.A.!"" While Trump was cheered on in suburban Maryland, other Republicans openly worried Friday about whether, in coming cycles, the party can hang on to the traditionally Democratic and independent voters Trump wooed, and they criticized him for doing little since his election to reach out beyond his core supporters. Young women?"" Former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said that the party needs to stay focused on expanding its base and that it remains to be seen how successful Trump will be at reshaping ""a party of Reagan that no longer exists."" Trump's fledgling administration has given conservatives plenty to cheer, including many of the president's Cabinet selections and his pledges to repeal the Affordable Care Act and pursue sweeping tax reform.

"Sweden, Nation of Open Arms, Rethinks Immigration","Swedes are not rushing to a hard-line Trump-like approach to immigration, nor are they ready to throw out their country's humanitarian values when it comes to sheltering refugees, values that remain firmly rooted in the national psyche. [...]a year and a half ago, Sweden offered lifetime protection, along with family reunification, to people deemed legitimate refugees. ""Sweden has been a top recipient of asylum seekers per capita in Europe, priding itself on a humanitarian approach to immigration,"" said Daniel Schatz, a visiting scholar at Columbia University's European Institute. ""While the country seeks to maintain a humanitarian ideal, public concerns around immigration have begun to shift the politics of traditionally liberal Sweden to tighter immigration controls and more restrictive policies. Rape, rape, serious rape, assault rape, black mail, black mail, assault in court, threats, attack against police, threats against police, drugs, serious drugs, attempted murder, rape again, black mail again and abuse,"" Mr. Springare said. The murder rate in Malmo is the highest among Scandinavian countries: 3.4 annually per 100,000 citizens, compared with 1.3 in Stockholm, the capital.

"Fearing ICE raids, town isn't sure what to believe; For immigrants in Santa Paula, rumors can pass for facts","[...]Santa Paula's police chief, Steven McLean, said there were no ICE arrests in his town and criticized activists for heightening fears during anxious times. ""What it did was unnecessarily cause fear in my community when they could have simply picked up the phone,"" he said, and ""called the chief of police -- who happens to be Latino -- and hear it from me instead of just putting out that press release that just caused all kinds of fear in the Hispanic community."" In the town, nestled in the rich, agricultural Santa Clara River Valley, more than one mural -- and a town monument -- feature farmworkers. When the CHIRLA alert began to circulate, Crosswhite fielded phone calls, emails and texts from community members questioning whether it was true. The night after the release went out, a mother called the Santa Paula Police Department saying she had seen on social media that immigration officers were at the Boys &amp; Girls Club. Laura Espinosa, one of the founding members of the city's Latino Town Hall and the Ventura County district director for the League of United Latin American Citizens, said that when the ICE rumors started, she talked to McLean, the police chief.

Buffett Assails Money-Manager Fees as Berkshire Reports Profit Rise; Billionaire also declares victory in his $1 million bet with another asset manager that low-cost index funds would out earn hedge funds over a decade,"Berkshire's net earnings rose nearly 15% in the fourth quarter, boosted in part by the stock market's end-of-year gains, but the conglomerate's results were roughly flat for the full year. Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities that is Mr. Buffett's preferred yardstick for measuring net worth, rose 10.7% in 2016, compared with a 12% total return in the S&amp;P 500, including dividends. Investment gains declined for the year, partly because Berkshire recorded such a large one-time gain in 2015 due to holdings in Kraft Heinz Co. One of the biggest investments made by Berkshire over the past year was the amassing of a stake in tech giant Apple Inc., which then soared to a record high on better-than-expected iPhone sales and building anticipation for the next edition of the phone. Mr. Buffett in his letter said he would consider exercising the warrants if Bank of America raises its dividend to 44 cents from 30, and would exchange Berkshire's Bank of America preferred shares to fund the transaction. In 2007 Mr. Buffett bet $1 million that his chosen index fund, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares, would outperform hedge funds over the next decade.

Designs on the V.A.,"There is an ecosystem of players driving this work: the Presidential Innovation Fellows program; United States Digital Services; and the Lab at OPM, run by the government's Office of Personnel Management. The use of design to improve things like software and web interfaces began to ramp up in 2013 with the work of Amber Schleuning, deputy director of the V.A. Center for Innovation, and Martin Martin, the V.A.'s CTO and a former Presidential Innovation Fellow. The team took inspiration from high-profile success stories like the redesign of gov.UK in Britain (where individual websites, each with their own home page, were streamlined into a one-stop entry point that allowed you to pay your parking ticket or get a marriage license). Helping governmental agencies treat their constituents like customers they hope to retain should in no way be translated as advocacy for the privatization of those functions (as seems to be the desire of the current administration). Tens of thousands of veterans already wait longer than five years for a final appeals decision, and the V.A. continues to face rapid growth in its appeals workload. Other recent projects include improving the forms required to connect with mental health services, modernizing call centers and expediting the hiring process (essential at a time when the department lacks the doctors it needs).",1872189904,Newspapers," Arieff, Allison

"Democrats Elect Tom Perez as Party Chairman; Former Labor secretary, backed by party establishment, defeated Keith Ellison from the party's populist wing","ATLANTA--Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee on Saturday, giving the party an establishment leader at a moment when its grass-roots wing is insurgent .Mr. Perez defeated Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison and four other candidates in a race that had few ideological divisions yet illuminated the same rifts in the party that drove the acrimonious 2016 presidential primary between Vermont Sen.

McMaster knows what can go wrong. Can he stop it this time?,"Military scholar Phillip Carter says the new national security adviser can bring the lessons of his book on Vietnam to the White House For a generation after losing the Vietnam War, the American military soothed itself with a ""stabbed in the back"" narrative: In the book, McMaster carefully avoided many of the larger questions raised by his scholarship, such as whether military dissent might have altered the course of the Vietnam War - both as a matter of good historical tradecraft and career savvy. [...]McMaster must teach Trump to be more disciplined on national security matters - including his tweets, because every word from a president is a statement of U.S. policy. [...]most similar to the problems that his book described, McMaster must build an ecosystem that enables and encourages generals to speak up - and dissent when necessary and appropriate. McMaster must actively prod Cabinet officials and senior military leaders to express themselves, and he must protect them when their candor upsets the White House political team. Before that war, most military officers believed in the model articulated by political scientist Samuel Huntington: Civilians made the big policy decisions; generals saluted, took their orders and focused on the ""management of violence."" Since Vietnam, military and civilian leaders have come to embrace an ""unequal dialogue,"" in the words of national security scholar (and prominent ""never Trump""-er) Eliot Cohen.",1871890641,Newspapers," Carter, Phillip

Concern over the troubled U.S. political climate, beginning with its rhetoric-charged presidential campaign, has reverberated through India's thriving industry for test preparation and admissions coaching, which prepares students for study abroad. ""Everybody is asking me whether they should go or not, whether they should look at U.S. schools or not,"" said Kavita Singh, who runs the college admissions counseling service FutureWorks Consulting in New Delhi.

Trump's taunts stir Mexican nationalism,"The museum is housed in a former convent where Mexican troops were overrun by U.S. soldiers in the 1847 Battle of Churubusco. [...]for most of the three decades since the museum opened, its faded battle flags seemed like the stuff of buried history, an anachronism in an age of galloping North American Free Trade Agreement integration. [...]Trump's taunts have buoyed the poll numbers of 2018 presidential contender Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the left-wing populist Mexicans see as the figure most likely to fight back. Later came the occupation of Veracruz by the U.S. Navy in 1914, and the 1916 invasion by thousands of U.S. soldiers chasing Francisco ""Pancho"" Villa, the prototypical ""bad hombre,"" who had raided the border town of Columbus, N.M. The result of these encounters, according to Mexican historian Lorenzo Meyer, is that the two countries developed vastly different forms of nationalism. The country eventually adopted steep tariffs that limited trade for decades. Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas nationalized the holdings of Standard Oil and other foreign companies in 1938, infuriating the firms but delighting Mexicans. In a show of patriotism, thousands of Mexican women came to a central square in Mexico City offering money, wedding rings and livestock to pay the companies back.

At one point, when he mentioned Clinton, the crowd, as was often the case at his rallies, started chanting, ""Lock her up!"" ""The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first,"" Trump said at another point, prompting the crowd to chant ""U.S.A.! U.S.A.!""

Who knew 'Arrival' could be so topical?,"(Some spoilers ahead.) Realism - the theory of international relations as a power-wielding, zero-sum game - shows up in George Romero's zombie movies and in ""Independence Day,"" about a human-alien war, Drezner says.Dr. Louise Banks, Adams's character in ""Arrival,"" eventually realizes that the aliens view diplomacy as a ""non-zero-sum game,"" like liberalism, which argues that cooperation among nations leads to mutual benefits.Even the comedy ""Men in Black"" plays on the double meaning of ""alien"" - in the opening scene, a man who appears to be an undocumented immigrant smuggled in a truck turns out to be an extraterrestrial in disguise.The HBO series ""Westworld,"" a sci-fi and Western mash-up, is a kind of meta-take on this displacement, depicting a future in which humans sign up to live in a Western environment where the characters are played by robots - another popular sci-fi version of people other than us.' "" ""Arrival's"" Levy recently sat in a Hollywood editing studio working on Season 2 of another sci-fi producing project, the Netflix series ""Stranger Things,"" when the creators of the show, the Duffer brothers, barged in to show him a video from the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.",1871892644,Newspapers," Pincus-Roth, Zachary

CPAC rebrands itself with a 'T',"President Trump, addressing the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, reminisced about the ""very exciting"" moment several years ago when he had his coming out as a conservative. In 2011, the Reagan principles still held sway: free trade, limited government, U.S. leadership overseas, and plans to reform entitlement programs at home to balance the government's finances. [...]to judge from the adulation for Trump and his agenda at CPAC last week, conservatism is about: ripping up trade deals, expanding executive police powers, retreating from foreign engagement, and declaring Medicare and Social Security inviolate. [...]he read closely from his speech. [...]though most did swoon for the reality-TV star, he was booed lustily by the Ron Paul supporters, while many laughed at his now-characteristic boasts (""I graduated from ... the best business school"") while some social conservatives were wary.

Tanned, with slicked-back gray hair, our latest addition wore a hat showing that he, too, had served in Vietnam.

Other real estate agents in the area report luxury homes geared toward Chinese buyers taking up to half a year to unload. The San Gabriel Valley, long the destination of Chinese home buyers looking to provide their families a better living environment as well as safeguard their wealth in American assets, is feeling the effects of Beijing's crackdown on capital flight.

"Starting again from scratch, in El Salvador; Many deportees struggle, but a few learn to thrive [Corrected 02/27/17]","Influx of deportees Immigration has been a fact of life in El Salvador since the 1980s, when millions fled a violent civil war that pitted leftist guerrillas against the U.S.-backed military government. Deportation has been a fact of life since the 1990s, when many Salvadorans, especially those who had become involved with U.S. street gangs, started to be sent home. Jeannette Aguilar, who runs a public polling center at Central American University in San Salvador, said the growing number of call centers that employ English-speaking deportees there isn't a long-term solution. Pablo Alvarado, a U.S. citizen who fled El Salvador during the civil war and leads the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a U.S. immigrant rights group, is working to create employment training centers for returnees, who he believes have much to offer El Salvador. Gang problem Juan Villegas went to the U.S. to be with his mother -- and came home several years ago covered with gang tattoos.

When ICE agents are 'bad hombres'; Immigration and Customs Enforcement is an agency prone to overreach.,"With an executive order signed in his first week in office, President Trump has ""taken the shackles off"" ICE and Border Patrol officers, according to the White House, expanding the priorities for deporting immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly claims his agents will focus on those convicted of or charged with crimes, but immigrant advocacy groups and the news media already have documented arrests, detentions and deportations of immigrants who in no way represent a threat to public safety. In those days, immigration agents liked to roll out press releases touting the successes of their ""fugitive operations."" Once they were deemed stable -- in the cases I covered, such judgments were questionable -- they had to appear in immigration court, often without representation despite laws that require the state to provide the mentally disabled with legal help. David Gerbier, a green card holder with two U.S. citizen children, was deported...",1871900964,Newspapers," Hernandez, Sandra

"THE OSCARS / POLITICS; A blue-red state of mind; Once again, Academy Awards land in a divided country. But things feel different too.","What better way to defuse, or at least momentarily set aside, explosive ideological tensions than by debating the merits of Natalie Portman's performance or Dev Patel's get-up, by marveling at a red-carpet faux pas or wondering why Emma Stone always seems to find her way into best-picture nominees? When race-themed films such as ""In the Heat of the Night"" and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" won top Oscars (best picture and lead actress, respectively), it both underscored racial progress and revealed that far too many Americans were still uncomfortable with it. (Irony of Meryl Streep's presence noted.) So raw was the wound that a group of L.A. veterans greeted the ""Deer Hunter"" nominees at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, then-home of the Oscars, with protests; after a clash, 13 arrests were made. What am I, just going to get up there and say, 'Thank you?' "" The odds of multiple celebrity speeches following in the path of Streep's Golden Globes political plea are high, whether it's Viola Davis, likely presenter Leonardo DiCaprio or other activist stars not yet revealed. [...]in wake of an election cycle animated by a resentment on the part of working-class middle Americans toward ""coastal elites,"" they're very much the opposite now. (A recent poll by the Hollywood Reporter and the National Research Group found that two-thirds of Trump supporters turned off the television when awards speeches got too political.)

"These aren't 'bad dudes,' Mr. Trump","Not long after that, just 10 years old, she headed to Rome with immigration reform advocates and asked Pope Francis if he could help save her father and millions of others from deportation. ""The family is on pins and needles,"" said L.A. attorney Alex Galvez, who is requesting that federal officials use ""prosecutorial discretion"" and spare Vargas, who has lived in the U.S. without authorization for 17 years. Galvez argues that Vargas is a working, law-abiding family man of good character, with the exception of the DUI conviction, and is the primary breadwinner for Jersey and her five brothers and sisters, who are U.S. citizens. If Trump is such a great businessman, why doesn't he produce a breakdown on the costs and benefits, including the impact on the economy, wages and the price of goods? If that bothers Trump, why is he so timid about the bad hombres in the construction, agriculture, hospitality and banking industries, all of whom rely on and profit from illegal immigration?

""Pemex has always worked as an appendix of the government and Ministry of Finance, and worked less as an oil company,"" said Ariel Ramos, a partner at Mayer Brown, a legal services firm in Mexico City, and a NAFTA and energy expert.[...]Ramos said that rule and ones like it have essentially fallen from use since Pena Nieto opened the oil industry to foreign investment three years ago.",1871901145,Newspapers," Tillman, Laura

Agents Discover a New Freedom on Deportations,"Interviews with 17 agents and officials across the country, including in Florida, Alabama, Texas, Arizona, Washington and California, demonstrated how quickly a new atmosphere in the agency had taken hold. Since they are forbidden to talk to the press, they requested anonymity out of concern for losing their jobs. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said on Tuesday that the president wanted to ""take the shackles off"" of agents, an expression the officers themselves used time and again in interviews to describe their newfound freedom. ""Morale amongst our agents and officers has increased exponentially since the signing of the orders,"" the unions representing ICE and Border Patrol agents said in a joint statement after President Trump issued the executive orders on immigration late last month. Two memos released this past week by the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of ICE and the Border Patrol, provided more details about how it would carry out its plan, which includes Mr. Trump's signature campaign pledge -- a wall along the entire southern border -- as well as speedier deportations and greater reliance on local police officers. At Kennedy Airport, Customs and Border Protection agents checked documents of passengers getting off a flight from San Francisco because ICE, a sister agency, thought a flight 1583 tonight at JFK.

Immigration a long road for youths who enter U.S. alone,"Thousands landed in Illinois, where 2,300 kids last year were placed by the agency in juvenile detention centers, called shelters, as they awaited a decision on whether they would be released to relatives in the U.S., remain in detention or be deported. Others spent weeks or months traveling on foot through jungles, or packed like sardines on trains and in trucks, often fleeing violence in their home countries. While his January executive order directed the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that unaccompanied children are properly processed and cared for in custody -- guidelines reiterated last week in a memo issued by DHS Secretary John Kelly -- their futures remain uncertain. The memo estimated that 60 percent of minors who cross the border alone are placed with a parent living in the U.S. illegally, and it instructed federal agencies to explore whether those children are still eligible for special protections. The DHS memo also seeks to enforce laws against people who smuggle or traffic children into the U.S. Advocates said parents who hired a smuggler might fear deportation if they claim their children and instead might choose to leave them in custody. Unlike other young immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally at least a decade ago, most unaccompanied minors like Karina who have arrived in the recent surge do not qualify for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama administration program that has granted deportation reprieves and two-year work permits to 750,000 immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as...",1871924475,Newspapers," Bowen, Alison

Politics is on menu at local restaurants,"Some restaurateurs say their efforts are an extension of their long-standing political views, while others say the decision to take action -- whether it be closing to allow employees to participate in a political protest or sending food to support immigration lawyers working with those affected by the administration's travel ban -- ""is just the right thing to do."" The restaurant industry, after all, is one of the largest employers of immigrants in the U.S. Industry experts say it's best for restaurant owners to keep their political views to themselves but acknowledge that's a difficult task in the current political environment, no matter which side of the aisle one falls on. Cook County went decisively for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, and donations by local restaurateurs skewed strongly Democratic as well, based on a search of political donations on www.OpenSecrets.org. About 1 in 4 employees in the restaurant industry is foreign-born, and the industry is also one of the largest employers of workers who are in the country illegally, according to government data. On Inauguration Day, Roper dubbed Hopleaf a ""No Trump Zone"" and donated part of the day's sales to Planned Parenthood because of concern about possible legislation that would limit access to abortion services. Hopleaf has held a number of fundraisers for charities related to social justice, the environment and public education.

"Building an Empire Along the New Silk Road; China recently completed a railway service to Tehran that delivers goods via Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Such projects abound. Benjamin Shull reviews ""China's Asian Dream"" by Tom Miller.","In November 2012, shortly after taking the reins as leader of China's Communist Party, President Xi Jinping spoke of a ""Chinese dream"" in a speech delivered at the national museum in Tiananmen Square. For the Chinese president, the dream entails ""the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,"" and as Tom Miller notes in ""China's Asian Dream,"" it has become the ""guiding philosophy"" behind China's vision of itself: ""After years of preparing the ground, China is determined to take its place as a modern world power."" Mr. Miller, an editor at China Economic Quarterly who has traveled extensively in Asia, unpacks the substance of China's rise on the continent, chronicling in detail its massive cross-border investments and its infrastructure building spree.

Buffett Assails Money-Manager Fees as Berkshire Reports Profit Rise; Billionaire also declares victory in his $1 million bet with another asset manager that low-cost index funds would out earn hedge funds over a decade,"Berkshire's net earnings rose nearly 15% in the fourth quarter, boosted in part by the stock market's end-of-year gains, but the conglomerate's results were roughly flat for the full year. Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities that is Mr. Buffett's preferred yardstick for measuring net worth, rose 10.7% in 2016, compared with a 12% total return in the S&amp;P 500, including dividends. Investment gains declined for the year, partly because Berkshire recorded such a large one-time gain in 2015 due to holdings in Kraft Heinz Co. One of the biggest investments made by Berkshire over the past year was the amassing of a stake in tech giant Apple Inc., which then soared to a record high on better-than-expected iPhone sales and building anticipation for the next edition of the phone. Mr. Buffett in his letter said he would consider exercising the warrants if Bank of America raises its dividend to 44 cents from 30, and would exchange Berkshire's Bank of America preferred shares to fund the transaction. In 2007 Mr. Buffett bet $1 million that his chosen index fund, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares, would outperform hedge funds over the next decade.

Undocumented migrants urged to lie low after DHS move,"Advocates worry giving data for Obama deferral program could backfire Immigration lawyers and advocacy groups are advising undocumented immigrants not to enroll in a federal deferred-action program created by President Barack Obama over fears that the Trump administration will use their personal information to detain and deport them. On the day the memos were released, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that ""everybody who is here illegally is subject to removal at any time."" A White House draft executive order, leaked to news organizations last month, showed that Trump was considering a plan to halt new DACA applications, while allowing those already enrolled to continue until their two-year work permits expired. DHS officials said that DACA requirements stipulate that recipients who commit crimes or have ties to gangs can be stripped of their protections. Since 2012, about 1,500 people have been removed from DACA over such infractions, said Christensen, the spokeswoman. [...]Obama's attempt in 2014 to create a similar deferred-action program for undocumented parents of U.S. citizens was blocked in federal court after Texas and 25 other states, mostly with Republican governors, sued, calling it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority.",1872095630,Newspapers," Nakamura, David

Unofficial role of Trump's Cabinet: Clarifying his words,"Top aides have had to explain, and contradict, president's statements After President Trump said that deporting undocumented immigrants was ""a military operation,"" Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly, speaking in Mexico, clarified that there would be ""no use of military force in immigration operations."" After Trump, standing next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, upended decades of U.S. policy by saying he was open to a one-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East, U.N. envoy Nikki Haley asserted that the United States ""absolutely"" supports a two-state solution. [...]diplomats and foreign leaders nonetheless emerged from 2 1/2 days of meetings with the vice president uncertain whether he really spoke on behalf of the president or whether his dull diplomacy could yet be undone by a tweet or stray remark from Trump just days later. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, ultimately suggested that Trump was using ""military"" as an adjective referring to the precision and efficiency with which deportations were occurring - not the operations themselves. In President George W. Bush's White House, one disagreement broke into embarrassing public view after the president's counsel and chief of staff raced to the intensive-care unit hospital room of John D. Ashcroft, then the attorney general, to try to persuade him to reauthorize Bush's domestic surveillance program, which the Justice Department had just determined was illegal.",1872095828,Newspapers," Parker, Ashley

[...]Nguyen has raised her immigrant story throughout her tenure in Sacramento, such as during a 2015 effort to stop state-funded colleges and universities from banning display of the American flag.

Sweden's Defense and National Security Adviser? 'We Don't Know This Guy',"[...]he may not even be named Nils Bildt. According to public records, Mr. Bildt was born Nils Tolling, the son of the chairman of the Swedish Equestrian Federation, and went by that name as recently as May, when he registered a business, Modus World West, in Montana. [Video: Nils Bildt på Bill O'Reilly Factor Fox News Watch on YouTube.] Mr. Bildt's time in the spotlight began last Thursday, when he appeared on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" to argue that immigrants were the cause of a violent crime wave in Sweden. Prosecutors in Virginia charged him in 2014 with public drunkenness and obstruction of justice, both misdemeanors, as well as one felony count of assaulting a police officer, according to court records. On Saturday the URL for the website for one of his companies in Connecticut, Corporate and Transportation Security Solutions, had been redirected to an English-language article in Dagens Nyheter that described him as a ""fake Sweden expert.""",1872108242,Newspapers," Stack, Liam

He's a Local Pillar. Now He Could Be Deported.,"How he hosted a Law Enforcement Appreciation Day at the restaurant last summer as police officers were facing criticism around the country. How he took part in just about every community committee or charity effort -- the Rotary Club, cancer fund-raisers, cleanup days, even scholarships for the Redbirds, the high school sports teams, which are the pride of this city. In his note, Richard Glodich, the athletic director at Frankfort Community High School, wrote, ""As a grandson of immigrants, I am all for immigration reform, but this time you have arrested a GOOD MAN that should be used as a role model for other immigrants."" After a report of his detention appeared in a local newspaper, The Southern Illinoisan, some comments were pointed: ""No U.S. citizen is above the U.S. law! No illegal alien is above the U.S. law!"" And: ""I get that this man has been here for years and years and has contributed to society, but he isn't LEGAL, therefore the U.S. has every right to throw him out."" ""What I'm really worrying about,"" she said in a telephone interview, ""is what am I going to tell my three boys if he can't stay here?"" Tim Grigsby, who owns a local printing shop and considers Mr. Hernandez one of his closest friends, has been helping to lead the efforts to bring Mr. Hernandez back to West Frankfort.",1872108305,Newspapers," Davey, Monica

Chip Makers Plot a Future in U.S.,"Robots glide along the ceiling, moving silicon wafers the size of dinner plates between hulking machines that deposit and etch microscopic layers of material to build the most advanced memory chips in the world. For Intel and Micron Technology, the two American companies that jointly own and operate IM Flash, the venture allows both of them to sell cutting-edge, three-dimensional memory chips while sharing the multibillion-dollar costs of a modern semiconductor factory. Chip makers attribute the decline to a variety of forces, including high American tax rates and the hefty subsidies offered by foreign governments for new semiconductor plants, which can cost as much as $10 billion. The chip industry spends about one-fifth of its revenue on research and development, but it wants more federal funding for basic research into fundamental problems, like how to pack transistors closer together and whether materials other than silicon could form the basis of future chips. Foreign countries have become more appealing for chip manufacturers, in part, because of the rise of contract chip foundries owned by Samsung of South Korea and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The design combines the functions of a computer's ultrafast working memory and its slower, longer-term storage to create a hybrid aimed at companies like Facebook, Goldman Sachs and Exxon Mobil, which need to process vast amounts of data reliably and at the highest speeds. An article on Feb. 27 about computer chip makers' hopes that Trump administration policies will keep manufacturing in the United States referred incorrectly to...",1872108373,Newspapers," Goel, Vindu

U.S. Is Warned Travel Bans Would Harm World Cup Bid,"Aleksander Ceferin, installed last year as president of UEFA, the sport's governing body in Europe, said measures that might prevent players, fans or journalists from attending the event would count against any bid. [...]in an interview at UEFA's headquarters last week, Mr. Ceferin said immigration policy would be among the areas considered during the evaluation of a United States bid, and he suggested that it would ""not help"" if Mr. Trump succeeded in placing harsher restrictions on travel to the United States from certain countries in the near term. Mr. Ceferin's warning is significant; in addition to his position leading European soccer, he is a vice president of FIFA, world soccer's governing body and the organizer of the World Cup. A final decision on how many spots each confederation will be given is expected when FIFA meets on March 30, but Mr. Ceferin insisted that Europe's conditions are clear: UEFA will demand 16 places, an increase of three teams, and request a guarantee that only one European team will be placed in each three-team group. Though Mr. Ceferin, a former president of Slovenia's soccer federation, insisted that UEFA's commitment to staging the final matches of Euro 2020 in England remained...",1872108381,Newspapers," Smith, Rory

Visiting French Historian Threatened With Deportation,"Mr. Rousso, an expert on France after the First World War, was scheduled to give a keynote address on Friday afternoon at a conference organized by the Hagler Institute for Advanced Study at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. Mr. Rousso said he was interrogated by Customs and Border Protection officers who told him that he was violating immigration law by using a tourist visa to enter the country to attend the academic conference. Mr. Mills, an immigration lawyer in Fort Worth, said he received a call from the dean of the law school around 9 p.m. Wednesday. ""There was already a good team in place."" Since Mr. Trump took office in January, immigration authorities have engaged in several high-profile actions against immigrants. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the president wanted to ""take the shackles off"" of agents who had, under President Barack Obama, been under orders to focus only on serious criminals.",1872108687,Newspapers," McCANN, ERIN

The Hungry Dragon,"  China's Asian Dream By Tom Miller (Zed, 292 pages, $24.95) In November 2012, shortly after taking the reins as leader of China's Communist Party, President Xi Jinping spoke of a ""Chinese dream"" in a speech delivered at the national museum in Tiananmen Square. By outfitting the broader region with new investments, China seeks to ""create a network of economic dependency that will consolidate its regional leadership, enable it to hedge against the United States' alliance structure in Asia, and diversify energy supplies.""",1872112686,Newspapers," Shull, Benjamin

Trump invades Mexican minds; Just the concept of him has an effect on people near border.,"[...]interviews on the Mexican side of the frontier suggest that, in just a few weeks, the new president has had a profound effect on how people in the border region act, plan and, perhaps more importantly, think. ""There's just a lot of uncertainty right now,"" said Jesus Arturo Madrid Rosas, the representative here for Grupo Beta, a Mexican government aid organization that provides assistance to migrants.Down the hill in town, where backyards cluttered with bicycles, patio tables and toys push against the frontier fence, shrines mark the spot where, in 2012, a Border Patrol agent firing through a gap in the fence emptied about 10 rounds into a Mexican teenager, Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez.Despite the enforcement crunch of recent years, illicit drugs continue to pass through -- via narco-tunnels burrowed beneath the fence; in loads tossed over or hoisted across; and in semi-trailers and cars passing through the pair of busy ports of entry, sometimes sprinkled with especially potent chile pepper extract to dissuade sniffing dogs.Long before the Trump era, successive U.S. administrations poured billions of dollars into hiring more guards, improving fencing and deploying military-style hardware, from ground sensors to drones to floodlights and camera-mounted observation towers.Two Border Patrol agents, their green-and-white vehicle parked on a dirt road on the U.S. side, seemed skeptical that Trump's planned wall would be effective, given the rough, mountainous terrain and summer thunderheads.[...]Trump's border buildup comes at a time when illegal immigrant traffic is generally way down.",1872116504,Newspapers," McDonnell, Patrick J

Because regulations passed under the Clean Air Act have resulted in an average 70 percent fewer emissions of the six common pollutants regulated under that act.

A blue-red state of mind,"What better way to defuse, or at least momentarily set aside, explosive ideological tensions than by debating the merits of Natalie Portman's performance or Dev Patel's get-up, by marveling at a red-carpet faux pas or wondering why Emma Stone always seems to find her way into best picture nominees? The Oscars, as ABC constantly reminds us, are the second-most-watched television event after the Super Bowl, and they, in some sense, serve a similar purpose -- to temporarily freeze-dry our problems by investing us in the sagas of people with lives very different from our own. In 1968, the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led to the postponement of the Oscars by several days and the withdrawal, later revoked, by a quartet of African-American stars, including Sidney Poitier and Louis Armstrong. When race-themed films such as ""In the Heat of the Night"" and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" won top Oscars (best picture and lead actress, respectively), it both underscored racial progress and revealed that far too many Americans were still uncomfortable with it.

McAuliffe goes full tilt at governors' meeting,"McAuliffe enters his last year in office, prohibited by the Virginia Constitution from serving a consecutive term, with his future unclear. Virginia is right where he likes it, in the spotlight, with the race to replace him this year drawing national attention as a referendum on the Trump presidency. McAuliffe was in Washington as chairman of the National Governors Association, which held its winter meeting here. [...]in the atrium of the J.W. Marriott hotel, McAuliffe gestured broadly at the welcome message beamed onto the huge wall, three stories high, with his name and that of Vice Chairman Brian Sandoval (R-Nev.). The report predicted that many Americans would lose health-care coverage and that the changes could cost states billions. While McAuliffe has aggressively criticized the Trump administration's ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and stepped-up immigration enforcement, he spent much of the weekend making Virginia's case with the president. On Sunday, McAuliffe held a private, 45-minute meeting with Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly, then came out and said the retired general had assured him that immigration agents would not conduct random raids or arrest people unless they were involved in criminal activity.

"In Turkey, a U.S. social critic found fertile soil","A new Oscar-nominated documentary by the Haitian director Raoul Peck has tapped into a broader American revival of interest in Baldwin, whose fiction, essays and speeches have taken on added relevance in the era of Black Lives Matter and the fervent debates in the United States over race and identity, diversity and police brutality. ""Located on the margin of continents - between Europe and Asia, in the vicinity of Africa and the Middle East - Turkey provided a haven where Baldwin worked on some of his most important, and arguably most American, works,"" Magdalena Zaborowska, a professor of African American and immigrant literature at the University of Michigan, wrote in her book ""James Baldwin's Turkish Decade: Erotics of Exile."" [...]at one point, while visiting a Turkish village, Baldwin was badly beaten by two men who used a racial and anti-gay epithet, according to Baldwin's biographer and friend, David Leeming. In the tony, waterside neighborhood where Baldwin lived for a time, the gardeners and chauffeurs know the house as the library of a noted Ottoman-era intellectual, rather than the onetime residence of the famous American writer.

Dueling Ideals: Host Olympics or Curb Dopers,"Executives at the United States Anti-Doping Agency here are agitating for a forceful response to Russia's state-run doping program, lobbying international sports officials for more aggressive sanctions and for an overhaul of the global regulatory system. Testifying alongside him will be Michael Phelps, the world's most decorated Olympian; Adam Nelson, an American shot putter who was awarded a gold medal nearly a decade after his 2004 Olympic performance when a competitor was disqualified for doping; as well as officials from the I.O.C. and the World Anti-Doping Agency, to which the United States contributes $2 million annually. The Senate Commerce committee, which has not called a hearing but confirmed that its parallel inquiry was continuing, said on Saturday that it had ""challenged suggestions that the 2024 bid is a legitimate rationale for stopping or delaying necessary oversight of doping in international competition."" Congress's interest in the doping scandal, Mr. Tygart's activism and the United States' inquiries into international sports corruption -- from the FIFA case focused on soccer's global governing body to a Justice Department investigation into the Russian doping scandal -- could inform how some of his colleagues voted, he coupled with Donald J.

"THE OSCARS; A theatrical night of film; Unifying themes, high drama, wry jabs and flipped expectations -- all riveting right to the final curtain.","The question on the minds of Oscar watchers going into the ceremony was who would be most likely to follow in Meryl Streep's Golden Globes footsteps. Kimmel, whose demolition jobs are delivered with the smoothness of a barber giving an old-fashioned shave, had an irresistible target, and he certainly got in his share of presidential licks. (The absence of social media venom from the White House prompted the check-in.) But Damon served as a jocular safety valve, rescuing Kimmel from becoming too focused on the elephant not in the room. Experiencing the ceremony from inside the Dolby Theatre as a first-time attendee, I was fascinated by how the show managed the tightrope act of appealing to movie industry elites who dressed to the nines for the occasion and to the more casually attired viewers from all over the world who make up Hollywood's maddeningly heterogeneous consumer base.

White House's real immigration goal emerges; Trump and his aides target people they say won't assimilate.,"In pursuit of that goal, Trump in his first weeks in office has launched the most dramatic effort in decades to reduce the country's foreign-born population and set in motion what could become a generational shift in the ethnic makeup of the U.S. Trump and top aides have become increasingly public about their underlying pursuit, pointing to Europe as an example of what they believe is a dangerous path that Western nations have taken. [...]he is likely to issue a new travel ban this week, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Monday. Two days after Trump imposed the ban, a senior administration official told reporters at the White House that the order was part of a larger strategy to develop an immigration system that selects immigrants the White House believes will make ""positive contributions"" to the country. Inside the West Wing, the two men have pushed an ominous view of refugee and immigration flows, telling other policymakers that if large numbers of Muslims are allowed to enter the U.S., parts of American cities will begin to replicate marginalized immigrant neighborhoods in France, Germany and Belgium that have been home to plotters of terrorist attacks in recent years, according to a White House aide familiar with the discussions. While the travel ban languishes in court, Trump's aides are drafting a new order that will probably apply to the issuance of future visas from the listed countries and refugee admissions and allow people already approved to enter the country.

Crazy plot curve will haunt Oscars,"According to the Los Angeles Times, a stagehand in the wings was heard to say: ""Oh my God, he got the wrong envelope."" A really good, often exhilarating movie, which deservedly handed director Chazelle the directing prize and Emma Stone the leading actress award, ultimately lost out to a genuinely great story of a young, gay, thwarted-but-ultimately-liberated African-American boy, growing up in 1980s Miami. Mark Rylance, last year's supporting actor Oscar winner for ""Bridge of Spies,"" presented the supporting actress nominees but first made time for a thought or two on the subject of opposition. "" ""Zootopia"" won the animated feature Oscar, which provoked co-director Rich Moore to remind us that the movie was about racial profiling, allegorically speaking, and that ""tolerance"" will always crush ""fear.""

UIC's international athletes won't let politics affect team rapport [Corrected 02/28/2017],"On election day in November, the Illinois-Chicago men's soccer team spent 4 1/2 hours on a bus to Dayton, Ohio, for the Horizon League championship. UIC, which has 3,145 international students according to school officials, has a steadily growing international community both in its overall student body and on its athletic teams. In particular, President Donald Trump's hard line on immigration -- from his proposal to build a wall at the Mexican border to his court-rejected travel ban to more aggressive laws on deportations -- and his description of Mexicans in disparaging terms were topics in locker rooms and on team buses. [...]how do players with polar political views avoid letting that disrupt team chemistry? UIC soccer seems to have found a formula.

"The Town That Can't Do Without Refugees; Donald Trump's decision to curb number of refugees admitted to U.S. could hurt cities like Erie, Pa., where employers worry economic progress will stall","Lost in much of the debate over President Donald Trump's immigration order is a detail that stands to have a big impact in some places: the decision to cut by nearly two thirds the total number of refugees the U.S. will receive this year, to 50,000 from 110,000.At Sterling Technologies, Inc., a plastics-molding company outside Erie that makes rain barrels and composters, about a quarter of the 160 workers are refugees.On a recent afternoon, refugees toiled in production, maintenance and quality control divisions at Rehrig Pacific Co., which makes plastic crates and garbage containers.By the late '80s, arrivals had climbed to about 400 each year as the U.S. government and nonprofits that receive them decided the city's size, affordability and social-services network made it a good fit for newcomers, said Paul Jericho of the Multicultural Community Resource Center, who has worked with Erie refugees for more than 30 years.Mr. Trump imposed a four-month moratorium on the entire U.S. refugee resettlement program as part of the order that is facing legal challenges.The influx of refugees, who receive assistance from the federal government, sometimes breeds resentment.",1872549930,Newspapers," Miriam Jordan | Photos by Jeff Swensen for

"Donald Trump's New Travel Ban Is Delayed, Would Likely Exempt Existing Visa Holders; President had planned to sign the order Wednesday; concern about competing with messages from Congress address","The revised approach including only new visa applicants is meant to address concerns raised by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which stayed several key provisions of the original order. The federal appeals court said the original order likely violated constitutional due-process protections for travelers excluded from the country, because they weren't given notice of the policy or a chance to challenge their denial of entry into the U.S. It is possible the administration could avoid the same kinds of due-process issues by focusing on foreigners who don't have green cards or visas in hand, meaning they haven't been previously approved for U.S. travel. While the Ninth Circuit focused on the due-process issue, a Virginia federal judge ruled two weeks ago that the travel ban likely violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination by singling out Muslims.

"Donald Trump Asks Congress to Unite Behind Health Care, Tax Overhauls; President promises improvements to economy, infrastructure and national security","WASHINGTON--President Donald Trump turned from the ominous language that characterized his major campaign speeches as he delivered Tuesday an impassioned plea for Congress to capitalize on a political uprising and unite behind major overhauls of health-care and tax laws. Referring to the surge of nationalism that lifted him into the White House as a ""renewal of the American spirit,"" Mr. Trump struck an optimistic tone while calling on lawmakers to rebuild the middle class and inner cities instead of financing ""one global project after another. In the Democratic response, former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear said his party would oppose every GOP move to undo the 2010 health law they view as a signature domestic achievement of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Mr. Trump has wavered on the idea, and Tuesday night's comments brought him somewhat closer to House Republicans, who have seen their border-adjustment plan run into a buzz saw of corporate lobbying from retailers and sharp opposition from Republican senators. In an emotional high-point of the speech, he defended as highly successful a raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of a Navy special operator, William ""Ryan"" Owens, and singled out his widow in a moment that...",1872640274,Newspapers," Bender, Michael C

China Gloats as Trump Squanders U.S. Soft Power; Beijing sees ideological shift in Washington as something of a godsend,"To the extent that the Trump White House closes the country's borders to immigrants, raises the specter of trade tariffs or impedes the operations of a free press--even when those restrictions have no equivalence in the repression that Chinese journalists suffer--it creates an opportunity for Beijing. Apart from Japan, which feels most threatened by China's rise and has gone all out to court the new White House, the most enthusiastic support has come from the region's authoritarians, who calculate that Mr. Trump won't push democracy or lecture them about media freedoms and other civil liberties. South Korea, home to some 28,500 U.S. troops, agonizes over whether it can afford to offend China by installing a U.S. missile-defense system against North Korea that Beijing sees a threat to its own security.

"Trump Speech to Congress Marks a Shift in Tone; The edges of the president's most incendiary rhetoric were sanded off, even as he made no major policy changes","President Donald Trump, after reaching the White House with fiery rhetorical attacks and a combative message, pitched his agenda to voters and Congress with language that was much more presidential and traditional in tone. Mr. Trump opened his first address to a joint session of Congress with a call to unity in the wake of attacks on Indian nationals in Kansas and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries: ""We are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms."" While he once again highlighted the challenges of violent crime in some urban communities and drew attention to crimes committed by illegal immigrants, he didn't repeat his denunciation of ""American carnage"" in his inaugural address. Delivering a formal address in the House chamber packed with the Washington establishment--including both friends and foes--was for Mr. Trump a far cry from the open-air campaign rallies and Inauguration Day address...",1872694912,Newspapers," Hook, Janet

Face time with refugees eight time zones away,"On a balmy evening in Irbil, Iraq, a teenager named Sami left the cramped, one-room structure he shared with his family and made his way across the Harsham refugee camp to a small concrete building, where his brother and two friends sat in plastic chairs. Personal stories The portal, created by the art and technology collective Shared Studios, sits in the rear of an exhibition that highlights the continuing threat of genocide. Visitors walk past explicit displays about ongoing conflicts and the increasingly dire global refugee crisis - maps, documentary videos, photos of frightened families crowded onto tiny boats. ""When we talk about genocides going on in the world, there's a sort of numbing effect because the numbers are so big,"" said Cameron Hudson, director of the museum's Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide. The Syrians and Iraqis who participate in the portal project have been forced from their homes by the Islamic State or the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; many have suffered trauma and witnessed horror. [...]even the mundane commonalities and awkward exchanges resonate; there is the sudden proximity to a person who might share your favorite soccer team, who likes to hang out at coffee shops and scroll through Facebook - even if they also happen to live in a sprawling, dust-covered refugee camp where they share a single tent with several family members.

"Revised ban will exempt visa holders, insiders say","A federal district judge in Washington state first suspended the travel ban Feb. 3, and a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit later upheld that freeze. The White House counsel already had clarified that the ban did not apply to legal permanent residents, although courts have said they could not rely on that assertion because it was a separate statement and not part of the executive order. Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's national Immigrants' Rights Project, who is involved in a separate legal challenge, said, ""If the new executive order contains a ban, we believe it is unconstitutional religious discrimination and will therefore continue our legal challenges."" Show me the right way to do it legally.'"" A federal judge in Virginia referenced those comments in ordering the ban frozen with respect to Virginia residents and institutions, calling it ""unrebutted evidence"" that Trump's directive might violate the First Amendment.

Vancouver officials shun Trump hotel opening,"VANCOUVER, B.C. - VANCOUVER, B.C. - Kerry Jang, a council member in this picturesque Canadian city, recalls being in the crowd nearly four years ago to welcome Donald Trump as he announced plans for a striking new skyscraper that would bring a luxurious hotel and condo development to the heart of downtown. While the Trumps have vowed to pursue no new foreign deals and to fully separate the management of the company from the Trump administration, Trump-branded properties around the world are nevertheless becoming symbols of the U.S. president - and, in some cases, staging areas for locals to express their feelings about his views on immigration, trade and other matters. In Dubai, government officials joined Trump's adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, on Feb. 18 for a red-carpet party toasting the opening of a glitzy new Trump-branded golf course. In Washington, the Trumps leased the second-tallest building in the city, the federally owned Old Post Office Pavilion, and turned it into a 263-room luxury hotel. Condo sales performed so badly there that the developer defaulted on a bank loan and the property was placed into receivership by an Ontario court. Stockton Williams, executive director of the Terwilliger Center for Housing at the Urban Land Institute, said that foreign investors have been snapping up condos in the city, driving up prices. Brent Toderian, the former city planner for Vancouver, said he remembers feeling ""embarrassed"" upon hearing that the Trump name - then associated with what he called ""bad...",1872699131,Newspapers," Brittain, Amy

Trump invited those family members to sit near first lady Melania Trump at his address, part of an emotional appeal by the president and his administration to build support for stronger border-control measures. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House principal deputy press secretary, said she could not confirm Trump's comments in the private event.

[...]he did endorse the plan of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to use tax credits to allow Americans of all incomes to purchase health coverage in their remake of the Affordable Care Act. In his roughly hour-long address in the House chamber, Trump stuck to broad strokes about his optimistic vision for the state of the nation, pivoting from the dark assessment that he painted in his Jan. 20 inaugural address.

Prepared Remarks and Actual Statistics,"ROBERT PEAR ""We are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals"" NOT A BIG CHANGE President Barack Obama had already ordered the Department of Homeland Security to make serious criminals a primary focus of his deportation efforts. Some do sneak across, but the borders are guarded by 21,000 Border Patrol agents along with a similar number of Customs and Border Protection officers at the 325 official ports of entry, which include airports, seaports and land border crossings.

Tony Blair's Lesson for Trump,"At their core, both seek to undermine the big systems that have stabilized the globe and spread prosperity, security, rule of law, democracy and openness after two world wars: the European Union, the global trading system, Nafta, NATO, the United Nations and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. The critics are great at pointing out the flaws of these systems, but they always forget to mention the hundreds of millions of people they lifted from poverty to prosperity and the extraordinary 70 years of peace they maintained since the end of World War II. In the Cold War era the world was glued together by these global institutions and by the fear and the discipline of two superpowers. The way Blair described Prime Minister Theresa May's commitment to executing Brexit -- no matter what -- sounded just like G.O.P. leaders' support for Trump's ideas after they had denounced them as utterly crackpot during the presidential campaign. Blair recalled other bogus arguments that were used by Brexit advocates and that have already evaporated -- like the notions that leaving the E.U. would save Britain some $440 million a week for its national health care service and that there was a danger -- most effectively exploited in a fear-inducing poster -- that Syrian refugees would overwhelm the U.K., but there was no Syrian refugee flood. Like that imports from Mexico and China -- not robots, software and automation -- are the big culprit in taking middle-class jobs; that we are being swamped...",1872717898,Newspapers," Friedman, Thomas L

A civil discourse on immigration,"Aside from the specifics of that case, many readers demanded to know why I don't write more about the cost of illegal immigration to native-born workers and taxpayers. [...]I don't see a strong connection between illegal immigration and a U.S. economy marked by obscene income inequality. Global realities such as automation, the spread of technology and the endless corporate quest for cheap labor are powerful forces, and pulling back on trade could hurt more than help. Not only do low-skilled immigrants tend to go after different jobs than natives do, but to the extent there's overlap in the manual labor pool, the presence of immigrants drives native-born workers into higher-paying jobs where they have the competitive advantage of citizenship and language skills. [...]Peri argued that without the undocumented labor force in construction, agriculture, hospitality and other fields, the gross national product would take a 3% to 4% hit.

No More Dreaming of America,"On my first night, I stared at the rows of car dealerships lining the main street of my small university town in Southern Illinois. America was a place, far away from the watchful eyes of aunts, uncles and neighbors, where it was possible to indulge in curious passions -- bartending classes, poetry groups, quail hunting, sex. There were slurs and snide comments about smelling like curry, but it never crossed my mind that America needed to be made great again, because I had already been seduced by its own conviction in its greatness.

'Time for small thinking is over',"President Donald Trump sought to rally a divided nation behind his nationalist agenda Tuesday, outlining goals to reform the tax code, overhaul the health care system and secure the country in a sweeping speech that was high on ambition but often short on details. Trump's call for ""historic tax reform,"" replacing President Barack Obama's signature health law and reorienting America's foreign policy will rise or fall on the GOP's ability to come together on the finer points of each policy matter. Trump called for a new education law that would spend more on charter and voucher school programs, an issue that has already marshaled opposition from teachers unions who failed in their effort to stop the confirmation of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Trump has framed the early part of his term with a series of orders and actions intended to gut regulations, halt trade deals, ban travelers from certain Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. and crack down on immigrants who came into the country illegally. Many Democrats chose guests to make their own pointed criticisms of the new administration's policies -- people living in the U.S. illegally, Americans who benefited from Obama's health care overhaul and refugees affected by...",1872752067,Newspapers," Bierman, Noah

Trump's Speech to Congress: Video and Transcript,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States ... (APPLAUSE) Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence. What kind of country will we leave for our children?

Sober setting of joint session of Congress doesn'temper Trump's need to inflate,"The ""16 words"" in President George W. Bush's 2003 State of the Union address that falsely claimed Iraq's Saddam Hussein sought uranium from Africa led to significant turmoil in the administration, including the criminal conviction of a top aide. [...]many of the president's false claims are old favorites that he trots out on a regular, almost daily basis. Trump has originally promised to extend the ban to congressional officials, but he did not. [...]the five-year ban applies only to lobbying one's former agency - not becoming a lobbyist. [...]Trump actually weakened some of the language from similar bans under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and he reduced the level of transparency. According to the group, the annual cost of illegal immigration at the federal, state and local level was about $113 billion as of 2013. [...]factors other than illegal immigration contribute to black unemployment, the report found, including the high school dropout rate and low job-retention rates.

Trump's stance on issues such as immigration and environmental regulation. In January, Mr. King and 21 professors at top business schools wrote a letter imploring President Trump to preserve current environmental laws and adhere to U.S. commitments to the Paris agreement on climate change. Tiffany Smith, a second-year student at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, helped found a coalition of students from about a dozen business schools committed to diversity and inclusion in business.

California Immigration Bill Sets Up Clash With Trump Administration; Legislation would restrict cooperation between federal immigration authorities and state and local police,"Lawmakers here are fast-tracking California Senate Bill 54 , which pro-immigrant activists call an aggressive move to thwart President Donald Trump's deportation policies, as a number of states consider similar moves to limit local and state police from participating in immigration enforcement. Last week, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed an executive order prohibiting the use of state resources in immigration enforcement, while Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy issued guidance to school superintendents and police chiefs restricting the degree to which they can work with immigration authorities. Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood, president of the organization, said sheriffs weren't interested in carrying out federal immigration duties, but the bill would block the ability to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on important matters. ""Is the next business going to be to say we can't work with the DEA, or the FBI, or any of our federal partners? Because that just doesn't make sense,"" Sheriff Youngblood said. State policy makers have for more than a decade worked to provide them with services such as driver's licenses, in-state tuition, university grants, student loans, professional licenses and government-sponsored health care for children.",1872854935,Newspapers," Lazo, Alejandro

Few specificson major policies,"Leader vows to rebuild U.S. military, economy President Trump sought to repackage his hard-line campaign promises with a moderate sheen Tuesday night, declaring what he termed ""a new chapter of American greatness"" of economic renewal and military might in his first joint address to Congress. Seeking to steady his presidency after a tumultuous first 40 days, Trump had an air of seriousness and revealed flashes of compassion as he broadly outlined a sweeping agenda to rebuild a country he described as ravaged by crime and drugs, deteriorating infrastructure, and failing bureaucracies. The president forcefully defended his travel ban of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries - an executive order that was halted in federal court - as necessary to prevent the entry of foreigners who do not share America's values. House Republicans immediately rallied behind Trump's remarks, interpreting his words as an endorsement of several key parts of their own plan. In an email to reporters, an aide to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) wrote that Trump ""embraced"" the House plan and demonstrated that ""the White House and Congress are coalescing around a particular approach"" that includes individual health-savings plans and tax credits. During a discussion about taxes, Trump recalled his visit with Harley-Davidson executives and ad-libbed, ""They wanted me to ride one and I said, 'No, thank you.'"" Trump opened his address by noting the wave of anti-Semitic vandalism and threats targeting Jewish cemeteries, community centers and schools.",1873327623,Newspapers," Rucker, Philip

Trump's Legislative Agenda Faces Headwinds; President must confront GOP divisions as he advances his policy proposals,"WASHINGTON-- President Donald Trump, whose modulated tone in addressing Congress Tuesday drew praise mostly from the GOP, now faces the daunting task of lining up votes for a tax overhaul, a replacement for the Affordable Care Act and other agenda items that have splintered his fellow Republicans. Mr. Trump must bridge differences within his party on top priorities while also drawing support from at least some Senate Democrats, at a time when voters in the Democratic Party's left wing are urging resistance. Democrats are unlikely to support either the tax framework put forward by House Republicans or the plan Mr. Trump proposed during the presidential campaign, which would cut taxes on upper earners. Mr. Trump seemed to back in vague terms a plan from House Republican leaders to replace the 2010 health-care law's subsidies with refundable tax credits, which Americans who don't get health care through work could use to buy private insurance. While some Republicans in the House support using the proceeds from a corporate tax deal that allows companies to repatriate overseas profits to fund a major infrastructure effort, that money is also spoken for by others--namely fellow Republicans who think the windfall should be used to offset...",1873076680,Newspapers," Mann, Ted

U.S. to Remove Iraq From Travel-Ban List; Decision comes amid concerns in Washington and Baghdad that restriction would undercut relations with ally in fight against Islamic State,"Removing existing visa holders from the ban, in particular, could help address the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concern that the order denies people due process.[...]legal challengers in several cases have made claims of religious discrimination, and one federal judge cited comments by Mr. Trump and his backers during his presidential campaign as an intent to impose a Muslim ban. ""The administration's delay in revising the order strongly undermines their claim that a ban was urgently needed to protect the country,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, who filed the first legal challenge to the travel ban.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis all argued in favor of Iraq's removal from the list during a series of conversations with the White House, U.S. officials said.Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that a Department of Homeland Security intelligence report found that immigrants from these seven countries pose no particular risk of being terrorists, contradicting the White House claims.",1873076709,Newspapers," Meckler, Laura

Bannon's stark, nationalist convictions offer a contrast to the rest of Trump's foreign policy team, which is dominated by generals, such as McMaster and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who have been strong advocates for an America engaged in the world through strong, multilateral alliances. The differences are particularly sharp on Islam, where the views of Gorka and Bannon mark a fundamental departure from the approach that Republican and Democratic administrations have taken to counterterrorism and the Muslim world over the past 16 years. In the late 1990s, McMaster's book ""Dereliction of Duty"" harshly criticized the military's senior leadership during the Vietnam War for failing to tell President Lyndon B.

LETTERS; His 'indoor voice',"Simultaneously, he wants to drastically increase U.S. defense spending by $54 billion, and to do that he plans, among other things, to make drastic cuts in the State Department, where diplomacy tries to prevent loss of life through consensus building and compromise. Single-payer saves money Re ""With healthcare, they think it's time to go solo,"" Feb. 26 Over a decade, according to a 2013 study performed by economist Gerald Friedman, the federal single-payer legislation referenced in this article would save $1.8 trillion and benefit 95% of all U.S. households by slashing administrative waste associated with the private health insurance industry ($476 billion per year) and by reducing pharmaceutical prices to European levels ($116 billion per year). A stand-alone, state-run single-payer system, however, will not be effective unless it includes provisions for preventing price-gouging by privately-owned hospitals and the pharmaceutical companies. If Republicans have any chance of winning in this state, it seems clear that they must distance themselves from the demagoguery of the Trump administration (something they seem unwilling to do) and come up with sensible, sustainable policies to address issues Californians care about: the environment, human rights, equality of opportunity, excellence in education and affordable universal healthcare.

BASEBALL; ANGELS REPORT; Escobar aims to become a U.S. citizen,"Aspiring to support his family by playing professional baseball in the U.S., Escobar escaped baseball-mad Cuba in September 2004 at age 21. Twice last season, he cursed when asked to comment on controversies, first when he appeared to forget the number of outs in an inning, and then when he drew a strike zone in the infield dirt to demonstrate a pitch's location to an umpire. The Angels explored trading him before last season's nonwaiver deadline, but opted to keep him and exercise his $7-million club option for 2017. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires naturalization test-takers to demonstrate an understanding of American history and government, and an ability to read, write, and speak basic English. Baldoquin signed for $8 million in 2015 and was in Arizona for spring training with the Angels in 2015 and 2016, but did not receive an invitation this season after hitting .219 in his...",1873257254,Newspapers," Moura, Pedro

Sox star Abreu: I ate fake passport,"Abreu testified in federal court Wednesday that he went to the restroom as soon as possible after the flight took off, but flight attendants quickly started knocking on the door.A Major League Baseball contract with the White Sox -- worth $68 million over six years -- was riding on Abreu's ability to enter the U.S. by a deadline in late October 2013, federal prosecutors say.Hernandez and Estrada have pleaded not guilty to allegations they were heavily involved in the shadowy world of illegally smuggling Cuban baseball players to the U.S. for lucrative contracts.Latouff told him he could not enter the U.S. using the fake passport and would have to destroy it while the plane was in flight, he said.Because of the immigration rules in effect at the time for Cubans, Abreu was granted permission to remain in the U.S. and was released from the airport hours after he landed.Photo: Sox first baseman Jose Abreu, center, leaves federal court in Miami, where he testified on player smuggling.",1873291350,Newspapers," McMahon, Paula

Trump sticks by a Cabinet member critical to carrying out his vision,"Sessions also has taken steps to undo the previous Justice Department's policy toward transgender children, changed its position on a Texas voting rights law the department had been fighting for years and reversed the previous administration's policy on the use of private prisons. During an internal White House debate over the transgender policy, Trump sided with Sessions over Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, according to the New York Times. The attorney general holds a unique role in any presidential Cabinet - requiring the person in the job to implement the president's policy goals on one hand, while faithfully enforcing laws on the other. On issues such as same-sex marriage and the reform of a criminal justice system, which they both saw as deeply unfair to young black men, the two worked hand in hand as Holder executed policies that they both supported. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said national security adviser Michael Flynn had the ""full confidence"" of the president, and on the same day, Flynn resigned amid revelations that he had mislead Vice President Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Sessions said at a Justice Department news conference Thursday that he would provide the Judiciary Committee a written explanation for his testimony in the next day or two, while still insisting it was ""honest and correct as I understood it at the time.""",1873535160,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

BACK STORY; Sessions' Russia troubles; Why Trump's attorney general has come under fire for earlier contacts,"Before he was confirmed by the Senate as Trump's attorney general last month, Sessions, 70, spent two decades in the Senate representing Alabama, where he previously served as state attorney general. [...]Sessions is the country's chief law enforcement officer, overseeing agents and prosecutors around the country who gather and depend on the veracity of sworn testimony every day. Sessions had one of the toughest, drawing intense opposition from Democrats and progressive interest groups, who said his views on immigration, gay rights, abortion and other issues were extreme. The Senate rejected Sessions for a federal judgeship in 1986 after testimony that he had made racist comments, including a crack about the Ku Klux Klan being OK with him, ""until [he] found out they smoked pot."" After debates that included the forced removal of liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sessions was confirmed as attorney general by a 52-47 vote, with support from just one Democrat, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin III. The FBI and other federal agencies are investigating whether Trump's associates and campaign aides had contact with Russian officials in the months leading up to the election. Flynn resigned after it became public that he had misled several White House officials about the contacts, including Vice President Mike Pence.",1873570047,Newspapers," Bierman, Noah

Thorny issues in push to give legal aid to migrants,"Amid a tense political battle over the nation's borders and who should be expelled from the country, California lawmakers this legislative session are on an emergency track to develop what is likely to be the largest legal defense program in the U.S. for immigrants swept into the federal removal process. After the Marshalls incident, Maria, who had a fake driver's license and Social Security number as forms of identification, was charged with burglary in the second degree -- a felony -- and five misdemeanors, including petty theft, possession of burglary tools -- her purse -- and the use of false documents. Unlike in the criminal justice system, where the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Constitution grants all defendants the right to counsel regardless of their income, people facing deportation are not entitled to an attorney if they cannot afford one. [...]over more than six years, as the Obama administration prioritized immigrants with criminal charges for removal from the country, immigration and civil rights lawyers in California and nationwide have worked to expand legal representation and ensure fair treatment of the most vulnerable immigrants under the law. Speaking on his behalf at the bill's first hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, immigration attorney Francisco Ugarte said it would ""set a dangerous precedent throughout the country for other initiatives where we are fighting for access to counsel.""

"Transcript: Q&amp;amp;A With Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen; Fed chief talks about decision-making at the central bank, labor-force growth and dinner-table discussions at home","[...]let's start first by talking a little bit about the role that the Federal Reserve plays in the global economy, as well as your relationship with the top financial ministers and central bankers in the leading industrialized - so how does that work? [...]there's not very much that we can do to affect labor force growth, although there is a tendency in a strong job market for people who may have become discouraged and dropped out of the labor force because they felt there were inadequate job opportunities - there is some tendency for people to rejoin the labor force and to get employment, and we have certainly seen that in this - in this recovery. [...]although more recent cohorts of retirees are working more and participating in the labor market more than earlier cohorts did, still there is a marked drop-off in labor force participation when people reach the retirement years. [...]that's part of the reason why our economy - it looks like its potential to grow at this point, unless there's a pickup in either labor force growth or productivity, looks to be in the neighborhood or maybe a little bit less than 2 percent, which is really lower than we're accustomed by historical standards. [...]let's talk about the tradeoff between waiting and - anticipating changes in fiscal policy or waiting until they take effect and then responding with monetary policy.

Back to a land they barely recognize,"Since President Trump took office in January, the number of U.S. government flights landing in Mexico City loaded with deportees has jumped from two a week under President Barack Obama to three, Mexican officials said. Trump, who made immigration enforcement a centerpiece of his campaign, has been clear that he views illegal immigrants as potential security threats and competitors to Americans for jobs. More returnees means lower wages for everybody in blue-collar industries such as construction and automobile manufacturing, where competition for jobs is likely to increase, economists say. [...]the loss of remittances from the United States - Mexico's second-largest source of revenue at roughly $25 billion last year - could have devastating effects, particularly in rural areas. A federal program launched in 2014, called Somos Mexicanos (We're Mexican), tries to help returning migrants find jobs, start businesses and deal with the emotional trauma many experience after leaving families in the United States. When Jose Manuel Torres, 23, followed his deported father back from Georgia about five years ago, he was denied admission to Mexico City's public university system because he lacked proof of graduating from his middle school outside Atlanta - despite having his high school diploma. De la Calle predicted that, in the short term, average wages will drop as more qualified people enter the country to compete for scarce jobs.",1873929337,Newspapers," Olivo, Antonio

"FATHER'S ARREST BY ICE STOKES FEARS; Federal agents detain man after he dropped his daughter off at an L.A. school, raising policy questions.","The school's executive director, Ricardo Mireles, has since ordered his teachers to talk to students whose parents are here illegally about creating a family plan in case they are detained or deported.ICE has a long-standing policy directing agents to generally avoid conducting enforcement activities at so-called ""sensitive locations"" such as churches, hospitals and schools.[...]more arrests now happen on the street, said the official.Agents didn't realize his other daughter was still in the car.Because the arrest was not carried out on school grounds, the official said, it does not represent a shift in policy.The official also noted that arrests by ICE's fugitive operations teams, who locate immigrants with deportation orders, have remained flat over the past year.Another misdemeanor conviction, in 1998, was for receipt of stolen property when he bought a non-DMV-issued vehicle registration tag.Last month, his administration swept aside nearly all restrictions on the removal of 11 million people in the U.S. illegally, a vast expansion of the federal government's deportation priorities.",1873946051,Newspapers," Castillo, Andrea

The continued allegations of millions of illegal immigrants voting, the years-long focus on Hillary Clinton's actions concerning Benghazi and her e-mail server, allegations of improprieties by the Clinton Foundation, Fox News focusing on President Obama's travel expenses, Trump's pronouncements having to be refuted so frequently -- these are all so much more damaging to our country than anything Friedman reports.

"CITY &amp;amp; STATE; Few hurdles, but running hard; Councilman Buscaino seems a sure bet for reelection. His big- money bid may point to future ambitions.","Yet Buscaino has spent more than a quarter of a million dollars on his reelection bid, hired consultants who worked on the presidential campaigns of President Obama and Hillary Clinton, and is appearing in television ads across the city. The consultants and advertising are aimed at passing an obscure ballot measure related to waterfront development in the Port of Los Angeles, a driving force in Buscaino's 15th City Council District. All the effort, political observers say, might be a sign that Buscaino is trying to raise his profile to possibly run for higher office or to mine a special set of circumstances that could allow him to serve on the City Council for 15 years, a tenure unprecedented in the modern era of term limits.

GOP wants Trump to take reins on agenda; Republicans worry their legislative plans are stalling because president is reluctant to take the lead.,"By now, Republicans in Congress thought they would be working closely with the White House on signature items of the GOP agenda -- repealing and replacing Obamacare and overhauling the tax code. Trump also spoke of taxing imports to help level the playing field for domestic manufacturers, giving a nod to the House GOP's blueprint for tax reform, even though his comments were less full-throated than some would have liked and did not resolve his past flip-flops on the so-called border adjustment tax. Conservative critics, including Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and the House's Freedom Caucus, view refundable credits as a federal government entitlement program like the Obamacare subsidies that help some Americans buy insurance. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) noted that by this time in his first year, President Obama had signed several bills into law, including the economic recovery act in the midst of the Great Recession. Pence is a regular at the Senate GOP's weekly policy lunch, and an entourage of White House staff members -- many former aides in Congress -- joined the House GOP's regular Tuesday morning meeting in the Capitol basement.

THE NATION; Time running out for 'Dreamer'; Attorneys for woman brought to U.S. as girl fear she'll be deported without a hearing.,"Attorneys for Daniela Vargas, a young ""Dreamer"" who was detained by immigration agents in Mississippi after speaking to the media about her family's plight, say they are racing against the clock to prevent her from being deported without a court hearing. While an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman continues to maintain that Vargas will appear before an immigration judge, Vargas' attorney, Abigail Peterson, said ICE officials informed her Thursday that Vargas would be processed as a ""visa waiver overstay"" and is likely to be flown back to Argentina without a court hearing or bond. According to Peterson, federal authorities maintain that by staying longer than the waiver allowed, her family waived some of their rights and became ineligible for an immigration hearing.

Trump Faces Furor Over Unsubstantiated Claim Obama Wiretapped Him; President adds meeting with attorney general and homeland security secretary as allies and foes react to his claims on Twitter,"Mr. Trump, who is spending the weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago club here, added a meeting with Mr. Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to his calendar on Saturday, as political allies and foes of the president continued to react to the president's claim on Twitter. The furor threatened to overshadow a crucial upcoming week for Mr. Trump, in which he is scheduled to release a revised executive order on immigration and Republican-led congressional committees are set to begin producing health-care legislation. Saturday's tweets marked a return to the caustic tone that has often characterized the president's remarks, a tone he departed from during a well-received speech to a joint session of Congress earlier in the week. Mr. Trump's latest tweetstorm comes after a rough week for the administration, as positive reviews for his address to a joint session of Congress--in which the president avoided ad hominem attacks and some of his harshest rhetoric--faded in the face of revelations that Mr. Sessions hadn't testified accurately about his communications with the Russian ambassador during his Senate confirmation hearing.

A not-so-desperate saga about coming to America,"Adams, a 33-year-old conservative commentator whose longtime dreams have included providing election analysis for the Fox Business Network (hey, if you're dreaming, you may as well go big), wanted to emigrate from his native Australia to the United States. [...]in the author's eyes, it was a saga for the ages, revealing gross miscarriages of justice, a dedicated conspiracy against his conservative politics and the naked abuse of power by liberal forces seeking to deprive America of his imported greatness. Rather than blame his lawyer for not better warning him of these requirements, Adams concocts a theory of personal oppression based on the consular officer's Facebook page, which outs him as sympathetic to Democratic politicians and gay rights. Because he didn't like my politics?"" He works himself into a lather. [...]Trump has shown that books - or the snippets he hears of them - can affect his policy views, as when Ann Coulter's 2015 book, ""Adios, America,"" helped shape his campaign statements on the supposed criminality of Mexican immigrants. Aside from lamenting a ""broken"" immigration system in America, and complaining that legal immigration is hard while illegal immigration is easy, ""Green Card Warrior"" offers scarce details on what a reformed, merit-based approach would look like. The ""extraordinary ability"" condition under which Adams gained his green card is supposed to reward individual merit, granting admission to talented people at the top of their fields in business, science, arts, athletics and other endeavors.",1874139030,Newspapers," Lozada, Carlos

Back to a land they barely recognize,"Since President Trump took office in January, the number of U.S. government flights landing in Mexico City loaded with deportees has jumped from two a week under President Barack Obama to three, Mexican officials said. Trump, who made immigration enforcement a centerpiece of his campaign, has been clear that he views illegal immigrants as potential security threats and competitors to Americans for jobs. More returnees means lower wages for everybody in blue-collar industries such as construction and automobile manufacturing, where competition for jobs is likely to increase, economists say. [...]the loss of remittances from the United States - Mexico's second-largest source of revenue at roughly $25 billion last year - could have devastating effects, particularly in rural areas. A federal program launched in 2014, called Somos Mexicanos (We're Mexican), tries to help returning migrants find jobs, start businesses and deal with the emotional trauma many experience after leaving families in the United States. When Jose Manuel Torres, 23, followed his deported father back from Georgia about five years ago, he was denied admission to Mexico City's public university system because he lacked proof of graduating from his middle school outside Atlanta - despite having his high school diploma. De la Calle predicted that, in the short term, average wages will drop as more qualified people enter the country to compete for scarce jobs.",1874139066,Newspapers," Olivo, Antonio

"Americans have been losing faith institutions for a long time. And we may not find it again, writes Bill Bishop.","[...]fewer than 2 in 10 Americans have ""a lot"" of trust in news organizations, the Pew Research Center has found, and we live in a ""Matrix""-infused ""conspiracy culture,"" according to social scientists, where one is thought to be impossibly simple to not understand that the world is ruled by collusion and machination. The president has maligned politicians, scientists, judges, teachers, labor union leaders and intelligence officials, among others. [...]that intervening period brought a series of tumultuous events: the expansion of the war in Vietnam, the Watts riots of '65, the civil rights movement and, then, assassinations and Watergate. The Watergate scandal led Americans to lose faith in their government. [...]the erosion hasn't been confined to the United States. From anti-abortion measures to laws governing factory farming, the policy action is taking place where majorities can do what they want without dealing with ""those people"" who live the next state over or a few miles down the road.

Trump'story of U.S. innovation depends on the rest of the world,"President Trump introduced the country Tuesday to a young woman in a white jacket seated next to her father - a man who once aspired to be a fighter pilot but for nearly two decades has made a career out of trying to cure his daughter and son of a rare, life-threatening disease. Against Trump's promises of an American economic renewal fueled by protectionism and trade barriers, the full story of Megan Crowley's miracle highlights the way critical innovations tend to emerge from a highly globalized network of manufacturing, knowledge- sharing and immigration - one that could be disrupted by Trump. The drug that saved Megan Crowley's life is a quintessential example of how American capital and research infrastructure draws cutting-edge scientists and talent from around the world, and how making progress depends on international and academic research collaborations. ""The United States has led the world in medicine production for decades, not only because of its ability to finance drug discovery, but also because, more than any other country, the United States represents opportunity regardless of borders, gender, race, sexual orientation or political cast. The complexity of innovation There's no question that the Crowleys' story is one of American innovation - a testament to the hard work and love of a desperate New Jersey father, the vision of a Dutch CEO who found his best business-building opportunity in the United States, the success of a Massachusetts company in working with researchers abroad.

Marijuana law is flashpoint in state relations with U.S.,"The White House and Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions are talking tough about enforcing federal law, under which the cultivation, possession and distribution of pot are illegal -- just at the point when California officials are pondering how to make good on the voters' directive to legalize the drug. Under the so-called Cole memo issued by the Obama administration in 2013, the Justice Department professed a hands-off approach to marijuana enforcement in legalizing states, except for efforts to keep the drug away from minors and keeping criminal gangs and cartels out of the industry. U.S. attorneys could examine license applications from pot businesses in legalization states and obtain injunctions against the applicants in federal court, charging them with contempt if they flouted the injunctions. With 4,000 agents assigned nationwide to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Kleiman asks, ""How much of that DEA capacity do you want to use on marijuana, when you have a huge opiates problem?"" Some experts are skeptical that administration talk about marijuana enforcement is anything more than ""puffery and typical right-wing I'm-a-hard-line-drug-warrior rhetoric,"" in the words of Hilary Bricken, a Seattle lawyer who represents marijuana entrepreneurs.

A winning recipe in South L.A.; Cambodians serve up fried chicken in neighborhoods they understand,"In a restaurant rising from an overgrown parking lot at 91st Street and Central Avenue, fried chicken, chow mein and the occasional fist-bump pass through holes cut in panes of bulletproof glass. The restaurant, part of the Louisiana Famous Fried Chicken chain, is a Southern California cultural mixtape: fried chicken, served by Cambodian refugees to black and Latino customers, from a chain founded by a white man from Michigan, Joseph Dion. The franchise owners -- many of them refugees -- share an understanding of poverty and struggle with the neighborhoods in which they are located. [...]they are frugal, getting by on far thinner profits than their competitors , turning survival into a bona fide business strategy, said Michael Eng, a Cambodian refugee who recently took over the entire chain. After a month in his garage with a 30-pound fryer, experimenting with a recipe he says he obtained from New Orleans chef Paul Prudhomme, he arrived at a product: chicken in a zesty Cajun batter fried to a soft crunch and finished with a slight, spicy heat. :: Dion opened the first Louisiana Famous Fried Chicken in 1976 on a corner lot at Vermont Avenue and Imperial Highway. Three weeks after Eng came to the U.S., the acquittal of police officers who beat motorist Rodney King sparked the Los Angeles riots in 1992. Few investors wanted to sink money into South L.A.

"As Slim's vast wealth slips, popularity rises","On June 15, 2015, the day before Donald Trump launched his presidential bid, Carlos Slim's personal fortune stood at just under $67 billion. The very same forces that are shrinking his fortune are, oddly enough, also boosting his popularity at home -- to the extent that he is now talked about wistfully as a candidate in next year's presidential election. A poll by El Universal in January showed that Slim was considered the best-suited Mexican to face Trump, edging out populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the early front-runner. [...]while long reviled at home for his hardball business practices, Slim has become politically palatable as cellphone bills have fallen because of a price war and regulatory crackdown. When The New York Times later dug up allegations of Trump's sexual harassment, he claimed reporters were acting as ""corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim,"" a reference to his 17 percent holding in the newspaper company, the biggest individual shareholder. Soon after, a local TV network in southern Mexico created a video calling for Slim to run as a presidential candidate in 2018. The impact on Slim was mitigated by his diversification away from Mexico -- the country only accounts for about a quarter of...",1874153344,Newspapers," Schmidt, Blake

Deportation force,"In 1954, after U.S. Border Patrol agents in Chicago rounded up dozens of Mexican immigrants living in the country illegally, a photographer snapped a striking image of deportees lined up on a Midway Airport runway. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promoted the idea of a ""deportation force"" to rid the U.S. of up to 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally -- an idea that sparked a comparison to the 1954 effort. A year before the ""wetback airlift,"" a Tribune Washington correspondent wrote that U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell had said ""an uncontrolled wave of crime remindful of the prohibition era is sweeping the southwest in the wake of the illegal entry of hundreds of thousands of alien Mexicans across the border."" Currently many unions support the cause of immigrant workers' rights, but back then union activists feared that that jobs were being lost to illegal immigrants.

Lawsuit accuses D.C. college grant program of discrimination,"Villalobos, with the help of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), filed a federal lawsuit in the District last week, alleging that the D.C. Tuition Assistance Grant (DCTAG) program unfairly discriminates against U.S. citizens with immigrant parents, including those living in the United States legally. The federally funded program is unique to the District and has become key to how city residents budget for college, providing grants to help students attend schools outside of the city because of its lack of a strong in-state university system. The program gives students up to $10,000 per year to help them bridge the gap between in-state and out-of-state tuition at four-year public colleges in other states; it also gives up to $2,500 per year for such institutions as two-year public schools, nonprofit private colleges and historically black institutions nationwide. [...]of a lawsuit the Southern Poverty Law Center filed in 2012, a federal court in Florida overturned a state rule that required the citizen-children of undocumented immigrants to pay out-of-state student tuition rates. [...]in 2014, a South Carolina court threw out a MALDEF case challenging state rules barring the children of undocumented immigrants from accessing state financial aid and requiring these students to pay out-of-state tuition rates. The organization has challenged the ruling with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. Since graduating from high school, Villalobos has worked a few retail and administrative jobs, served as a dog walker and trainer, and pieced together a life while she...",1874297644,Newspapers," Ross, Janell

No doubt Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made the case to Trump, contra Bannon, that to lump Iraq with Yemen, Somalia and Sudan would be to hamstring the war against the Islamic State and hand an easy victory to Iran. Or it could cease cooperation in stopping the flow across its southern border of Central Americans - who make up much of the current illegal alien traffic.

Trump's top diplomat stays under the radar; Some see Tillerson as the marginalized head of a department adrift.,"Tillerson's absence was conspicuous Friday at the release of the State Department's annual report on human rights around the world, a normally high-profile event that other governments closely monitor and previous secretaries rarely missed. The White House is considering deep budget cuts for the State Department that could significantly curtail his ability to conduct the global diplomacy that has been the backbone of U.S. foreign policy under previous administrations. At a news conference last week, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended Tillerson's relationship with Trump, saying the president regularly seeks and receives the diplomat's input ""in terms of foreign policy interaction."" With the FBI and several congressional committees investigating whether the Trump team had improper contacts with Russian authorities, perhaps it's not surprising that Tillerson -- who was close to Russian President Vladimir Putin several years ago -- has kept his head down. [...]his semi-disappearing act at the State Department after decades of high-profile, globe-trotting secretaries of State could have far-reaching implications for America's position in the world. Since taking office, Trump has alarmed allies by deriding the role of international institutions and trade pacts, squabbling with leaders of Mexico and Australia, challenging decades of policy with China and announcing a neo-isolationist ""America First"" policy toward the rest of the world. The silver-haired Texan prefers not to make pronouncements unless he ""really [has] something to say,"" according to a senior State Department official familiar with his thinking. Early in the administration, analysts had predicted that Tillerson would join forces...",1874304192,Newspapers," Wilkinson, Tracy

President Trump Signs Revised Executive Order Restricting Travel to the U.S. Travelers holding valid visas will be exempted; Iraq off list of targeted nations,"The original order, issued on Jan. 27, sparked widespread protests and multiple court challenges and was put on hold by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. In a separate legal challenge to the first order, a Virginia federal judge ruled that the travel ban likely violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination by singling out Muslims. ""The core constitutional problem of religious discrimination remains, so we will continue to challenge the ban,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, who filed the first legal challenge to the original travel ban.

White House Remains Mum on Source of Trump's Wiretap Allegations; Press Secretary Sean Spicer said President Trump's claims on Twitter that his predecessor wiretapped his office were 'based on numerous things',"WASHINGTON--White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined Monday to provide a source for President Donald Trump's incendiary claim that his predecessor wiretapped his campaign headquarters, marking the third day that the administration hasn't offered any evidence to support the allegation. House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah), in an interview with CBS on Monday, said he wasn't aware of any evidence for the president's claims. [...]far, I have not seen anything directly that would support what the president has said,"" Mr. Chaffetz said. In a national security probe, investigators seeking a wiretap must convince a judge there is probable cause that a target for surveillance is an agent of foreign intelligence, and that the main purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information.

U.S. to Temporarily Suspend Fast-Track Processing of H-1B Visas; Move not related to revised travel restrictions announced Monday,"U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it plans to temporarily suspend fast-track processing for the skilled-worker visa program, a move that could slow down the process of hiring foreign workers for U.S. companies. While the move threatens to slow the hiring of foreign workers for some companies, it falls short of President Donald Trump's campaign-trail rhetoric on the skilled-worker visa system.

Trump Signs New Travel Ban in Bid to Avoid Original Order's Legal Pitfalls; Travelers holding valid visas will be exempted; Iraq off list of targeted nations,"WASHINGTON--President Donald Trump signed a scaled-back travel ban that addresses some of the legal challenges to his original executive order, while blocking new visas for people living in six Muslim-majority nations and suspending admission of refugees to the U.S. The fate of the new order, issued Monday, is likely to hinge on whether courts see the restrictions as a constitutional effort to protect the nation from terrorism--the administration's stated reason for imposing it--or a dressed-up version of the ""Muslim ban"" Mr. Trump promised during his campaign. The original order sparked widespread protests and multiple court challenges and was put on hold by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. Opponents argued it was wrong for the U.S. to shut its doors to desperate refugees and pointed to data showing people from nations singled out for the ban are no more likely than others to pose a terror risk in the U.S. Administration officials said the travel pause is needed to institute better vetting procedures. The appellate court said it failed to provide basic protections, including advance notice of the new policy and an opportunity for travelers to challenge being denied entry. The changes could go a long way toward addressing that issue, partly with the 10-day phase-in period and partly because it doesn't apply to the people who had the strongest due-process claims the first time around: green-card and visa holders already screened and approved for U.S. entry.

"Trump seeks to remake immigration system, but he faces steep odds","Critics of the process have argued that ""chain migration"" has - along with an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants - fostered an influx of those who are competing with native-born Americans for low-wage, low-skilled jobs. [...]in his speech to Congress, Trump said that ""real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws. The ideology underlying Trump's approach is rooted in the worldviews of White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the former Republican senator from Alabama who was one of the fiercest opponents of comprehensive immigration reform efforts during the Obama administration. All three have pushed restrictionist measures to sharply reduce legal immigration, arguing that foreign workers present a direct threat to Americans in blue-collar industries - the types of people who voted for Trump in large numbers. To immigrant rights groups, Trump's talk of a merit system is code for slashing legal pathways into the country and focusing them on highly educated immigrants from advanced nations - a strategy that harks back to a 1920s backlash against a wave of immigrants who entered the country during the Second Industrial Revolution. The 2013 immigration bill included similar measures to reduce green cards for families and create more slots for high-skilled workers, who would have been ranked on a point system based...",1874597038,Newspapers," Nakamura, David

The visa program has been criticized by Republicans and Democrats as a way for companies to hire cheaper foreign workers, displacing American ones. The government had previously suspended premium processing for two months in 2015, when spouses of certain visa holders became eligible to work and their applications needed to be processed in a timely manner, said Ron Hira, a public policy professor at Howard University specializing in high-skilled immigration policy and the American engineering workforce.

Senate votes to kill work safety regulation for contractors,"Rule is one of several Republicans arepoised to roll back President Trump and congressional Republicans are poised to roll back a series of Obama-era worker safety regulations targeted by business groups, beginning Monday night with a vote by the Senate to kill a rule that required federal contractors to disclose and correct serious safety violations. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and other leading business groups have urged Congress and the Trump administration to eliminate the regulations, arguing that they discourage businesses from competing for government contracts, thereby reducing jobs. Hours before the Senate vote on the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released a staff report that says that 66 of the federal government's 100 largest contractors have at some point violated federal wage and hour laws. Since 2015, the report says, more than a third of the 100 largest OSHA penalties have been imposed on federal contractors. ""Instead of creating jobs or raising wages,"" she said, ""they're trying to make it easier for companies that get big-time, taxpayer-funded government contracts to steal wages from their employees and injure their workers without admitting responsibility."" Adopted in January, the rule responds to a 2012 D.C. Court of Appeals decision - Volks Constructors v.

Revised travel ban blocks new visas,"Trump order more specific, omits Iraq Critics still see legal issues, say Muslims are targeted President Trump signed a new travel ban Monday that administration officials said they hope will end legal challenges over the matter by imposing a 90-day ban on the issuance of new visas for citizens of six majority-Muslim nations. The new order provides other exceptions not contained explicitly in previous versions: for travelers from those countries who are legal permanent residents of the United States, dual nationals who use a passport from another country, and those who have been granted asylum or refugee status. Two Iraqi nationals who came to the United States as refugees in 2009, it says, were convicted of terrorism-related offenses, and in October 2014, a Somali native brought to the country as a child refugee was sentenced to 30 years in prison for plotting to detonate a bomb at a Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in Oregon. A Department of Homeland Security report assessing the terrorist threat posed by people from the seven countries covered by the president's original travel ban had cast doubt on the necessity of the executive order, concluding that citizenship was an ""unreliable"" threat indicator and that people from the affected countries had rarely been implicated in U.S.-based terrorism. The three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, for example, said that exempting green-card and current visa holders from the ban would not address the court's concern about U.S. citizens with an interest in noncitizens' travel....",1874603458,Newspapers," Zapotosky, Matt

Trump's New Ban Halts Travelers From 6 Nations,"The new order continued to impose a 90-day ban on travelers, but it removed Iraq, a redaction requested by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who feared it would hamper coordination to defeat the Islamic State, according to administration officials. ""Unregulated, unvetted travel is not a universal privilege, especially when national security is at stake,"" said John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, appearing alongside Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Ronald Reagan Federal Building in Washington on Monday. The removal of Iraq from the list came after talks with security officials in Baghdad and at the urging of Mr. Mattis and State Department officials, who have been in communication with Iraqi officials alarmed that the ban will turn public sentiment in their country against the United States. ""On the basis of negotiations that have taken place between the government of Iraq and the U.S. Department of State in the last month, Iraq will increase cooperation with the U.S. government on the vetting of its citizens applying for a visa to travel to the United States,"" homeland security officials wrote in a fact sheet given to reporters. Homeland security officials, speaking to reporters by telephone on Monday, pushed back against that news report, arguing that it was culled from public sources and excluded classified information that paints a more dangerous picture.",1874617375,Newspapers," Thrush, Glenn

The Reality of Illegal Immigrants Who Live in the United States,"There are 11 million of them, the best estimates say, laboring in American fields, atop half-built towers and in restaurant kitchens, and in swelling American classrooms, detention centers and immigration courts. (The Trump administration has pledged to pressure all 23 into doing so.) They tend to be younger -- the Pew Research Center has found that adult unauthorized immigrants were, at the median, about a decade younger than American-born adults -- and skew slightly more male than the rest of the country. TO HEAR MANY LIBERALS and immigrant advocates tell it, most undocumented immigrants are productive, law-abiding members of society, deeply rooted in communities, working hard, living quietly, paying taxes and raising families. (The proportion of felons in the overall population was 6 percent in 2010, according to a paper presented to the Population Association of America.) Immigration agents regularly arrest what the government calls ""criminal aliens."" At the end of January, agents arrested a 50- year-old Mexican man near Milwaukee who had felony convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, battery against a police officer, car theft and intentionally harming a child, and who had been deported twice before. The Trump administration has said it will continue to prioritize deporting those with serious criminal records, but, in a break with the Obama administration, the new policies also take aim at immigrants whose offenses are limited to living here without permission or minor crimes that enable immigrants to work here, like driving without a license or using a fake Social...",1874619589,Newspapers," Yee, Vivian

Women's movement plans next steps,"Tucked away behind rows of brightly colored comic books and board games, more than a dozen people gathered Saturday afternoon in the back room of G-Mart Comics in Logan Square, scribbling messages onto the backs of postcards with iconic images from the Women's March. Part of ""The Ides of Trump"" campaign, volunteers will mail the postcards March 15 in an effort to inundate the White House with grievances. Since January's Women's March, the movement has settled into a quiet backwater -- a period of planning and strategizing in living rooms and town halls. Another goal is to work on diversity issues by encouraging participants to attend the Black Women's Exposition in April and to support the economy of Little Village, a neighborhood where businesses and restaurants have suffered after last month's immigration raids deterred people from shopping. In the case of the women's movement, Washington, D.C., organizers are encouraging planning in the form of ""huddles"" -- casual meetings hosted in people's living rooms, where participants are invited to discuss their goals for the movement -- and town hall meetings with local politicians. A difference of opinion Kyla Lamontagne, 23, of Wrigleyville, said she believes the conflict within the women's movement comes down to whether being pro-abortion rights is an essential part of being a feminist. [...]if there was an olive branch extended and they said, 'Pro-life women, we want you on board, we want unity,' we'd be more than happy to talk,"" she added.

""The new order is simply a modified refugee and Muslim ban, and a continuation of the Trump administration's smear campaign against refugees and asylum seekers,"" McCarthy said in a statement.

"Indian Outsourcing Firms Look to Get Ahead of Immigration Curbs; As Trump administration weighs work-visa changes, information-technology firms boost lobbying efforts","The discussions centered on the H-1B skilled worker visa program , which permits Indian information-technology services firms to send thousands of workers every year to the U.S., according to senior Indian government officials familiar with the meeting. Indian outsourcers and U.S. tech firms say the visa program, which Mr. Trump assailed on the campaign trail as ""a cheap labor program,"" is necessary to fill jobs where too few workers with the right skills are available in the U.S. Critics say H-1B visas are used as a cost-cutting method, with firms largely hiring Indians, who are willing to work for less than Americans. Earlier in February, executives from India's biggest IT services firms gathered in New Delhi to discuss a plan to address the skill shortage in the U.S. by setting up schools in the U.S.'s Rust Belt towns to train local workers to do simple IT jobs, according to Shalabh Kumar, an Indian-American businessman, founder of the Republican Hindu Coalition, and Trump fundraiser who coordinated the talks.

Text: President Trump's Executive Order on Immigration,"[...]I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees.

(d) Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection the actions directed in this order. (b) In implementing this order, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, as appropriate, those providing an opportunity for individuals to claim a fear of persecution or torture, such as the credible fear determination for aliens covered by section 235(b)(1)(A) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(A). (c) No immigrant or nonimmigrant visa issued before the effective date of this order shall be revoked pursuant to this order.

"Afghan family detained at LAX wins release; U.S. officials still don't explain why man, wife and 3 kids were held despite having visas.","Federal officials have agreed to free an Afghan family that had been granted special immigration visas but was detained after arriving at Los Angeles International Airport last week, prompting complaints from civil rights lawyers who rushed to court on its behalf. Federal authorities notified the attorneys that the family would be freed shortly before a federal judge was supposed to decide whether to extend a temporary restraining order that blocked federal authorities from moving the family out of the Central District of California, which includes much of Southern California. On Saturday morning, a habeas corpus petition was filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of the family by Public Counsel and the law firm Gibson Dunn. The process for obtaining the special immigrant visa the family obtained before its arrival involves intensive vetting, including interviews, security checks, medical examinations and fingerprints -- as well as a finding that the applicant...",1874721619,Newspapers," Carcamo, Cindy

New travel ban aims to survive legal challenge; Trump's revised order removes Iraq from list of targeted countries.,"Iraq, whose citizens and nationals had been on the earlier list of banned travelers, was removed after officials there agreed to accept all Iraqis being deported from the U.S. Though Trump has repeatedly called the war in Iraq a disaster, language in the revised order praises the country's ""democratically elected government"" for close cooperation in fighting Islamic State terrorists and vetting travelers. The new ban also puts a 120-day limit on what had been an indefinite suspension on accepting refugees from Syria and removes language intended to help Christian refugees and other religious minorities facing persecution in winning asylum. Many in Trump's circle are eager to renew debate over the ban, which has been popular among Trump's supporters, after several days of questions about the White House's ties to Russia and a weekend in which Trump made unsubstantiated charges that President Obama was tapping his phones during the presidential campaign. In addition to blocking visas from the six listed countries, the new orders require agencies to ""take immediate steps"" to create ""enhanced vetting and screening procedures"" for all foreigners wanting to visit the U.S., a senior Homeland Security official said. The order and a separate memo signed by Trump also require federal agencies to track and publish data on foreign nationals who have been radicalized or accused of terrorist activity and to create reports comparing the long-term costs of keeping refugees in America with the expense of supporting refugees in safe havens near their home countries.

Her research paved way for Medicare,"Dorothy Rice, a federal economist whose research on the financial toll of illnesses and disabilities had a profound effect on health care in the United States, leading in part to the creation of Medicare in 1965 and to a more than $200 billion settlement with the tobacco industry, died Feb. 25 at a hospital in Oakland, Calif.Mrs. Rice, she said, was ""instrumental to the enactment of the Medicare program,"" which guarantees health insurance to people 65 and older, and to its subsequent refinement through the collection of data on all aspects of health care for the elderly.At federal health agencies including the National Center for Health Statistics, which Mrs. Rice led beginning in 1976, she established new statistical standards and spearheaded studies that provide data on health expenditures across the country.Mrs. Rice led studies on a range of ailments, including Alzheimer's disease and AIDS - ""you name a disease, I did a study on it,"" she once said - and did much of her research after leaving the federal government in 1982, when she became frustrated by cuts in funding for health research under the Reagan administration.",1874994589,Newspapers," Smith, Harrison

Calif. Democrat with a maverick streak led House Intelligence Committee,"Anthony Beilenson, a California Democrat who spent 10 terms in Congress, where he forged an independent path on thorny issues such as tax cuts and immigration and even anodyne matters such as National Grandparents Day, died March 5 at his home in Los Angeles. The congressman also had a home in Chevy Chase, Md. Mr. Beilenson was a Harvard-educated lawyer from the New York outskirts who settled in Southern California in the late 1950s to work for a cousin's entertainment law firm. In Washington, he was a workhorse on the powerful House Rules Committee, which decides which bills reach the floor. Mr. Beilenson, a longtime civil rights supporter, was accused by Latino groups of toughening his views to appeal to an influx of conservative voters in his district, which was redrawn in 1990. Even members of his family said he could take the notion of a principled legislator to extremes, as when his was one of eight dissenting votes cast against National Grandparents Day in 1978 because he saw it as a sop to the greeting-card industry.",1874994687,Newspapers," Bernstein, Adam

A melting pot fuels the new barbecue,"Think house-made corn tortillas with smoked brisket, guacamole and tomato serrano salsa.Korean barbecue is thin-sliced meats grilled quickly over a direct (typically, gas) fire, while the Indian tandoor uses a clay oven, and Sichuan duck is smoked over tea leaves, then frequently fried.Southern barbecue is big meats such as beef brisket, pork shoulder and ribs slow-smoked using an indirect fire of hardwoods.In Charlotte, the husband-and-wife team of Tim Chun and Lisa Kamura at the Seoul Food Meat Co. turn out meats marinated in Korean flavorings and served with pickled radish and sides of Sriracha cracklins, ramen mac-and- cheese and soy-pickled deviled eggs.At the food truck Honky Tonk Kid BBQ in Waco, Texas, David Gorham serves a rotating menu of ""global fusion,"" which combines traditionally smoked Texas meats with an international flair.In New York, Hometown Barbecue offers a lamb belly banh mi alongside traditional pulled pork sandwiches, Izzy's Smokehouse and Main House BBQ serve kosher barbecue (beef, chicken; no pork), and pastrami is on barbecue menus all over town. ""Whether serving [barbecue] as tacos rather than sandwiches or with beans and rice and stuff like pico de gallo as a garnish instead of pickles and onions, we're seeing the Mexican influence a lot more,"" Vaughn says.

Draft proposes security cuts to fund border wall,"Coast Guard, TSA, FEMA among agencies that would take budget hits The Trump administration, searching for money to build the president's planned multibillion-dollar border wall and crack down on illegal immigration, is weighing significant cuts to the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration and other agencies focused on national security threats, according to a draft plan. The proposal, drawn up by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also would slash the budget of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which provides disaster relief after hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters.

THE DESPERATE TREK; ESCAPING TRUMP'S U.S.; Fearful migrants make risky winter crossing to seek protection in Canada,"The tiny community of Emerson -- population less than 700 -- has seen its share of U.S. ""border jumpers"" over the years, but nothing like this.[...]last year, residents might spot five or six strangers passing through town over the odd weekend, carrying backpacks and looking disheveled.[...]since President Trump was elected last year on promises to crack down on illegal immigration and conduct ""extreme vetting"" of Muslims, the numbers have surged. ""Am I a criminal, or am I a terrorist or what?"" Neither could afford a lawyer to represent him in immigration court, and both lost their U.S. asylum cases.[...]after they had waited about seven hours, a driver pulled over for them and dialed 911. --Most of those fleeing the U.S. for Canada avoid official ports of entry because of an agreement between the two countries to send back asylum seekers.The arrangement is based on the principle, enshrined in international law, that those fleeing persecution should apply for asylum in the first safe country they reach.Migrant rights advocates argue that this encourages people to make dangerous illegal crossings and have called on the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to rescind the agreement.The Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council, one of the main refugee resettle- ment agencies in the province, has been sending vans to collect the migrants after they are processed and bring them to Winnipeg.ASYLUM SEEKERS make their way through Emerson at 6:30 a.m. after slipping into Canada.",1875017502,Newspapers," Zavis, Alexandra

Tragedy in public view; Family fears daughter's death will be politicized,"The driver -- who faces charges of murder, vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated in connection with the Feb. 19 crash -- is an immigrant in the country illegally who has been deported from the United States at least five times, according to police and court records. Estuardo Alvarado, 45, was fleeing the scene of a traffic accident at a ""high rate of speed"" when he smashed his vehicle into a car driven by Sandra Duran, according to Los Angeles police Det. William Bustos of the Valley Traffic Division. The Mexican citizen has never held legal status in the U.S., according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. Duran's death garnered national attention Tuesday morning when Fox News picked up a Los Angeles Daily News report about the crash, in which her sister expressed concern over Alvarado's immigration status. Though studies have found that immigrants, whether in the country legally or not, commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans, the killings have become a flashpoint in the national debate over so-called sanctuary cities and immigration enforcement policies.

Migrants Use Quiet Road as Offramp From U.S.,"CHAMPLAIN, N.Y. -- Roxham Road is a quiet country road jutting off another quiet country road, where a couple of horses munch on soggy hay and a ditch running along the muddy pavement flows with melted snow. Border officials and aid workers there say there has been a surge in people illegally crossing from the United States in the months since President Trump was elected, many of them natives of Muslim countries making bids for asylum. The president's executive order in January on immigration that affected countries that are mostly Muslim was certainly a factor, but so were frustration with the immigration process in general and concern over anti-Muslim rhetoric. An agreement between the United States and Canada makes it virtually impossible for them to ask for asylum at a legal border crossing; Canadian border officials would have to turn them back. If they have identification and do not appear to pose a security threat, the lawyers said, they are typically released and given a bus ticket to Montreal, where they wait for a hearing on their refugee status. ""Have Canada pay for it!"" He pointed out that Roxham Road can be hard to find. [...]recently, if you typed it into Google Maps, the pinpoint landed on a roadway on the other side of the border.

A Budget Reflecting Resentments,"[...]in areas as diverse as food stamps and housing assistance, education for the disadvantaged and Head Start, it could further fray the rest of America's threadbare social safety net. President Barack Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act -- the most significant expansion of the safety net since the War on Poverty in the 1960s -- has unsurprisingly bred class resentment, too. Only 13 percent of non-Hispanic whites draw benefits from means-tested programs, according to the Census Bureau analysis, compared with 42 percent of African-Americans and 36 percent of Hispanics. Since the 1960s, at least, liberal activists have held to the belief that a grand progressive alliance was possible: working men and women, the poor, immigrants, racial and other minorities coming together in a coalition to counter conservatives and their corporate allies.

Women skip work on day of protest,"In the Washington region, the large number of teacher time-off requests prompted public school districts in Alexandria, Va., and Prince George's County, Md., to close, along with at least nine charter schools in the District. The day brought a new edge to a feminist movement that gained steam the day after President Trump's inauguration, when more than a million people in the District and across the country spilled into the streets. In a public park in front of the White House, hundreds of men and women protested the ""Mexico City policy,"" known by critics as the ""global gag rule,"" which says that foreign nonprofits providing abortions will forfeit aid from the U.S. government. ""Resist Trump, stop the gag,"" they chanted. Since the Women's March, some conservatives have written off the movement because of its embrace of certain liberal causes, such as abortion rights and Palestinian rights.

Disney CEO faces Trump queries; Shareholders at annual meeting call for Robert Iger to quit the president's forum.,"Walt Disney Co.'s annual meeting took a sharply political turn as Chief Executive Robert Iger faced calls to step down from President Donald Trump's business policy forum.Investors also reelected 11 members of the company's board of directors and voted down two proposals brought by shareholders.Iger, a Democrat who supported Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, has been criticized on social media for not quitting the panel.Uber CEO Travis Kalanick left the group under intense public pressure following the rollout of Trump's initial executive order, which in January temporarily banned all refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. (A revised immigration order was signed by Trump on Monday.) But Iger offered a vigorous argument for the business benefits of allowing people into the U.S. to work.Iger also had an intense exchange with Justin Danhof of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank and policy institute.Danhof, a proxy for a group of shareholders, alleged that Disney-owned ESPN and ABC News have exhibited bias in their coverage of the Trump administration.",1875291720,Newspapers," Miller, Daniel

LOS ANGELES ELECTIONS; ANALYSIS; What will the future of L.A. Unified look like?,"Enrollment decline -- caused not only by charter growth but by gentrification, lower birth rates and reduced immigration -- has hurt a school system with high fixed costs related to building maintenance, lawsuit settlements and underfunded pension and health-benefit obligations."" ""L.A. sets the tone for education policy in the state, and so we want to be able to be part of that discussion, and that's why we're engaged in these types of races,"" said Richard Garcia, elections director for the California Charter Schools Assn.A probe by the district's inspector general recently led to an FBI raid on Celerity Educational Group, a nonprofit that manages six L.A Unified charter schools.Zimmer says that the district is making meaningful progress on graduation rates, student achievement and restoring morale in its workforce, and that a pro-charter majority would threaten that.With the backing of philanthropists and key civic leaders, Deasy pushed hard for shutting down or restaffing persistently low-performing schools, for using test scores as a significant portion of teacher evaluations and for limiting teacher job protections.There could not be a bigger contrast between candidates, said Jeanne Allen, head of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Education Reform, which backs expanding options for parents, including charters and government-supported scholarships for private schools.STEVE ZIMMER, Los Angeles school board president, thanks poll workers after casting his ballot Tuesday.",1875292333,Newspapers," Blume, Howard

Options for Sanctuary in U.S. Dwindle Even for the Hunted,"The two girls were doing homework at their dining room table when masked men burst in and gunned down their grandparents -- the community's only two health workers -- on rumors that the couple had been tipping off the police about gangs in the neighborhood. [...]on Monday, the Trump administration announced a four-month suspension on all refugee admissions to the United States so security procedures can be improved and, perhaps most significantly, cut the number of total refugees allowed into the country by more than half. In a statement on Monday, John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, said the new executive order would ""make America safer, and address long-overdue concerns about the security of our immigration system. Officials and immigrant advocates in Central America fear that as the Trump administration cites the danger of admitting potential terrorists cloaked as refugees from nations like Syria, it is disregarding the tens of thousands of people here who are being terrorized by street gangs that actually originated in the United States. Even before Mr. Trump's executive order on Monday, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said they had not been taking on any new cases since the president first sought to suspend refugee admissions in late January, effectively freezing new applications to the program. The new executive order will prolong that freeze for at least another 120 days, leaving children under threat in the region with some daunting choices, including staying where they are or making the long, dangerous trek to...",1875295002,Newspapers," Robles, Frances

Journalism or Propaganda? A Russian TV Network Blurs the Line,"Mr. Bogachikhin was poking fun at the charge from Western governments, American and European, that RT is an agent of Kremlin policy and a tool directly used by President Vladimir V. Putin to undermine Western democracies -- meddling in the recent American presidential election and, European security officials say, trying to do the same in the Netherlands, France and Germany, all of which vote later this year. Western attention focused on RT when the Obama administration and United States intelligence agencies judged with ""high confidence"" in January that Mr. Putin had ordered a campaign to ""undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process,"" discredit Hillary Clinton through the hacking of Democratic Party internal emails and provide support for Donald J. Trump, who as a candidate said he wanted to improve relations with Russia. The agencies issued a report saying the attack was carried out through the targeted use of real information, some open and some hacked, and the creation of false reports, or ""fake news,"" broadcast on state-funded news media like RT and its sibling, the internet news agency Sputnik. RT and Sputnik propel those campaigns by helping create the fodder for thousands of fake news propagators and providing another outlet for hacked material that can serve Russian interests, said Ben Nimmo, who studies RT for the Atlantic Council. Other reports included the ""liberation"" of Palmyra by the Syrian Army with ""the support of the Russian Air Force;"" an interview with former British ambassador to Syria and a United States...",1875295284,Newspapers," Erlanger, Steven

"California GOP Stakes Out Position on Poverty; In a state dominated by Democrats, Republicans focus on those missing out on the strong economy","While some of those bills are co-authored with Democrats, and Republicans say they expect bipartisan support, the GOP has also gone on offense, rolling out a social media campaign attacking Democrats on housing affordability, transportation costs, inequality and poverty. [...]they point to Republican support for the Earned-income tax credit, which supplements the federal tax credit and aids low-income workers. The U.S. Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure, which is adjusted for the cost of housing, places California second among the 50 states and Washington, D.C., with a poverty rate of 20.6%, just under the District of Columbia's 22.2%. The Republican Party's share of the voter registration is about 26% statewide, and Democrats expanded their majorities in both houses of the state legislature to supermajority status, meaning they can fast-track legislation and raise taxes without a single Republican vote.",1875392899,Newspapers," Lazo, Alejandro

Garcetti has his mandate -- what's next?,"[...]voters appeared to back the mayor's vision for Los Angeles -- an urban city with denser development along transportation lines -- by soundly rejecting a slow-growth measure that was also on the ballot. The president's crackdown on immigrants has heightened concerns that the International Olympic Committee may choose Paris over L.A. In a sign of these new challenges, the mayor's victory speech Tuesday was interrupted by protesters who want him to take a tougher stand against Trump on immigration issues. Because Garcetti faced token opposition in the mayoral election, he didn't have to run much of a campaign or lay out his vision for a second term. First elected in 2013, the mayor rode a economic recovery wave that spurred the development of housing, restaurants and shops in neighborhoods such as downtown Los Angeles, Venice and Hollywood. The improved economy helped raise city revenues to fund Garcetti's ""back to basics"" plan -- paving more streets and trimming more trees -- and restore cuts to the police and fire departments. Initial results show Garcetti picked up nearly 81% percent of the vote in an 11-way contest, a margin that outpaced that of every other L.A. City Hall politician who faced a...",1875650237,Newspapers," Smith, Dakota

"IMMIGRANTS IN LIMBO; Ill in America, a boy is homesick for Syria; His mother's quest for a visa has so far been fruitless","The 5-year-old, a U.S. citizen, left Damascus in August and came to Los Angeles in order to receive medical treatment for a rare disease that leaves him with infections in his spine and unable to walk without a back brace. Tony has juvenile idiopathic arthritis -- a rare disease that leaves him sweating from high fevers and throbbing pain in his bones. The new travel ban includes a waiver that experts say is one way the boy's parents might be able to gain entry to the United States if his mother does not receive a visa before next week's deadline. Waivers are decided on a case-by-case basis and would grant citizens from the six countries entry if they are visiting a close family member who is a U.S. citizen and if they can show that denying them entry would cause ""undue hardship.""

"Trump's New Job Is Good for His Golf Empire, and Critics Complain","""The stars have all aligned,"" Eric Trump, who as executive vice president of the Trump Organization oversees all its golf properties, said on Thursday morning, while sipping an iced tea at the restaurant inside the Trump International Hotel before appearing at a promotional event for the Memorial Day tournament. What he did not mention at the news conference, while the cameras were rolling, is the product placement of incalculable value that is helping boost the Trump Organization's golf courses: his father. Eric Trump says the company has invested more than $1 billion in the golf course business since 2005 and has seen a recent surge in revenue because of the continued rising fortunes on Wall Street, which is always good for this high-end game, as well as the unprecedented attention that the brand is receiving. [...]the overlap is already drawing protests, including from environmental groups, which are angry that one of the first acts Mr. Trump took as president was to move to repeal a landmark Environmental Protection Agency rule -- hated by the golfing industry -- that is intended to protect drinking water supplies. In 2022, Bedminster is scheduled to host one of golf's most prestigious men's major championships, and he has forcefully -- and so far unsuccessfully -- lobbied the sport's foremost national governing body, the United States Golf Association, to award its most prized tournament, the United States Open, to a Trump golf course.

"To Pay for Border Plan, Cuts Are Proposed for Coast Guard","The Trump administration is considering deep cuts in the budgets of the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency as it looks for money to ratchet up security along the southern border, according to a person familiar with the administration's draft budget request. Of chief concern were the potential cuts to the Coast Guard, the nation's primary domestic maritime security force, which lawmakers and experts said had already been stretched thin by the wars on drugs, illegal immigration and terrorism. Representative Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee on the Coast Guard and maritime transportation, was even more acerbic, calling the proposal ""an insult"" that would put the nation's security at risk. Should law enforcement officials clamp down on the land crossings into the United States, experts said, the maritime interdiction role would most likely only increase, putting additional pressure on the Coast Guard. ""Where do you think drug smugglers and illegal immigrants will go next if you make the land border more impervious?"" said David Heyman, who was assistant Homeland Security secretary for policy from 2009 to 2014.",1875650837,Newspapers," Fandos, Nicholas

Stakes high for Trump on healthcare debate; Outcome will be crucial in defining his early presidency,"Conservative critics launching daggers at the Republican healthcare bill emerged confidently from the White House this week, insisting President Trump was heeding their concerns.[...]there's little question that the outcome of the healthcare debate will play a major role in defining Trump's first term in office, affecting his ability to deliver on other priorities such as a $1-trillion plan to rebuild public works, a multibillion-dollar border wall and a daunting challenge to rewrite the tax code.Unlike Obama, who tried but failed to get bipartisan support for his healthcare plan, Republicans have shown no interest in courting Democrats, who face intense political pressure to avoid compromise.[...]healthcare industry leaders, hospitals, doctors and nurses have become some of the most vocal and pointed critics of the bill, warning that it risks leaving millions of patients without access to health coverage.On Thursday, the legislation sailed through the House Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees after intense overnight sessions, but the slim resistance from Republicans on the panels suggested a lack of broad support.GOP CRITICS of the healthcare plan championed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan say they think the president will abandon the bill and let Ryan take the fall.Tony Cardenas, left, and Raul Ruiz and other members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee spent an overnight session debating the Republican proposal to replace Obamacare.",1875651934,Newspapers," Bierman, Noah

LETTERS; How to keep secrets,"After nearly a century of the government classifying everything under the sun and then lying about it, average Americans are no longer accepting the default explanation of ""looking out for the security interests of the country,"" which on its face is absurd because there is no serious threat to the nation's security. The dismal percentage of eligible voters who turned out for L.A. County's local election was pitiful. Are the people who did not vote the ones who complain the most about the results? I pride myself on never missing an election. Since 1970, when I first became eligible, I have never passed up a chance to vote.

Apprehensions at U.S.-Mexico border decline; Number of would-be immigrants caught plunges 40% under Trump in season that usually sees a surge.,"[...]Hipsman cautioned, typically each time the government adopts new immigration enforcement measures -- for example, building detention centers to accommodate the surge of Central American women and children -- the numbers fall, only to rebound, in some cases higher than before. While the new administration's rhetoric on immigration enforcement may, in the short term, be a strong deterrent to people who are thinking of coming to the U.S., the long-term repercussions of Trump's policies are not likely to be seen for months and years, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative Washington-based research institute that advocates stricter immigration policy. In addition to installing more physical barriers such as walls and fences along the border, Vaughan said long-term success in deterring illegal immigration would depend on whether the federal government ended ""catch and release,"" the unofficial name for a policy in which immigration officials allow immigrants they deem low-risk to remain at large pending a hearing. Advocates for immigrants say the data raise new questions about what is happening to immigrants crossing the border illegally, particularly asylum seekers -- families and unaccompanied children fleeing poverty and violence in Central America and beyond.

"U.S. Hoteliers Go on Charm Offensive Amid Concerns Over Trump Policies; Tourism industry fears Trump's travel ban, immigration stance will negatively affect business","Tourism authorities in cities such as New York and Los Angeles, along with smaller and midsize hotel chains, have started crafting messages meant to appeal to international travelers who may be on the fence about patronizing the U.S. Groups such as the U.S. Travel Association, which represents airlines, hotels and other recreational businesses, argued this week that the administration needs to do a better job of communicating to international travelers who ""may have been put off by the initial travel ban."" Larger global hotel chains such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and Marriott International Inc. have been much quieter about the political ramifications of the administration's new policies. Because of their global footprint, they are less exposed to a potential drop-off in visits to any single market such as the U.S. Smaller regional operators say they don't have the same flexibility.

"Why Donald Trump's Wall Won't Keep Out Illegal Immigrants; The lure of better jobs in the U.S. will outweigh higher crossing costs, and the wall would mainly serve to enrich people-smugglers","Between 1992 and 2008, the U.S. Border Patrol quadrupled the number of hours that its agents spend guarding the 2,000-mile frontier, according to the Department of Homeland Security.Research by DHS shows a neat link between the number of line-watch hours put in by the Border Patrol and the average fee paid to coyotes, whose tool kits now include GPS trackers and high-powered electric fence-cutters.[...]the main driver of fluctuations in the number of illegal immigrants has been the ups and downs of the U.S. economy.[...]migration fell again after the recession of the early 2000s, rose a bit as the U.S. economy rebounded, then plunged as the housing market (and construction jobs) collapsed in the wake of the financial crisis.[...]the number of people being apprehended at the border each year rose by half, and the total number of Mexican migrants living in the U.S. (most of them illegally) doubled.The expertise required to get a person over today's border already means that drug cartels are getting into what was previously an amateur business, sometimes loaning out their tunnels for people-smuggling.",1875884345,Newspapers," Wainwright, Tom
