Full text: JOHANNESBURG -- The United States team bus, emblazoned with the slogan "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Victory," was mobbed when it rolled through Pretoria on Wednesday.
The rowdy crowds that lined the streets did not pelt the bus with balloons filled with goat urine or bombard the team with slurs and deafening music, as they sometimes do when the Americans play a World Cup qualifier in Central America. Instead, the red-white-and-blue-clad supporters showered the team with chants of "U.S.A." and serenaded it with toots from their vuvuzelas.
"It is not often you see them lining up on the road before the game, all dressed up and chanting and banging on the bus," Coach Bob Bradley said after the Americans beat Algeria, 1-0, on Wednesday. "That was a really special moment for the team."
The team has had a number of special moments during its run to the second round of the World Cup, including two come-from-behind games and a heart-stopping, added-time victory to catapult the team to the Round of 16, where it will face Ghana on Saturday in Rustenburg. But for the first time in this tournament, the Americans may not be the crowd favorite when they face the last African team left.
"I totally understand that," forward Jozy Altidore said. "The World Cup is in Africa for the first time. The whole continent is really excited for that."
The Americans have been buoyed by a large and vocal traveling contingent that rivals the most loyal European or South American soccer fans. Bill Clinton, the former president, and Reggie Bush, the New Orleans Saints running back, are among those who have visited the team in South Africa.
"We felt it in the stadiums the past few games," said Carlos Bocanegra, the United States captain. "When the national anthem was being played, we could tell there was a lot of American support and fanfare."
In the past, the Americans have not always enjoyed the crowds' backing, even at home. The team has played Central American opponents in cities with large immigrant populations from Latin America where United States supporters are a minority. During World Cup qualifying games on the road, ornery fans whose national identities are closely tied to their soccer teams fill the stands of ramshackle stadiums, where jeers echo in the ears of visiting players.
"We can still typically find our supporters in those stands," Coach Bob Bradley said. "We've always had a very loyal group of people that support U.S. Soccer. We appreciate that."
According to FIFA, more World Cup tickets were sold in the United States than in any country other than South Africa. Not all of them were bought by United States fans; some buyers are fans of other teams, like Mexico and Honduras, who live in the United States. Others are expatriates. But the support from American fans in the stadiums here has been considerable.
In the United States, the team's World Cup games have drawn record television ratings and have captured the popular attention in a way that soccer never has. The team, which gets by as much on spirit as it does skill, is heartened and is more connected than ever before.
Altidore said he received 134 text messages after the Algeria game. Landon Donovan, whose late strike sparked spontaneous celebrations around the world, heard from more than 11,000 fans after his succinct Facebook post, "WOW:)."
"It's nice now to get to share in some of that," Donovan said. "I remember in 2002, we really had no idea on what was going on back home."
During the United States' run to the quarterfinal eight years ago in South Korea, fans at home crowded sports bars well after last call to watch the Americans play more than a dozen time zones away. Now, ESPN is capturing an enthusiastic early-morning audience, with South Africa six hours ahead of the East Coast, that posts to Twitter and Facebook throughout the day.
The American team also engenders great support from South Africans, who have an affinity for the United States and learned to love this tight-knit group of soccer upstarts during their surprising run in the Confederations Cup last summer.
The players may not be as recognizable as the European stars who play in the world's popular leagues broadcast on TV around Africa, but they are more accessible. The team held an open practice in Pretoria and invited more than 350 youths from local education programs to attend. The players spent as much time signing autographs and taking photos as they did training.
The United States Embassy has begun community outreach programs to bolster the team's profile here, and U.S. Soccer officials have engaged in personal diplomacy, handing out lapel pins bearing the African word "ubuntu," which means togetherness.
With the beloved but overmatched home team out of the tournament, South Africans will lend their enthusiasm to a second suitor, and Ghana may enjoy the benefits of African kinship. The Black Stars have had great support against European teams like Serbia and Germany, and they will probably have many fans traveling to Royal Bafokeng Stadium. The government went so far as to import fans from home, at the taxpayers' expense, to bolster the Black Stars.
"Seeing the amount of South African people who have supported us has been fantastic," Donovan said. "I expect the same on Saturday."
He added: "We can compete and beat any team in the world. Saturday happens to be Ghana."

Full text: If you're one of those sports fans that thinks the regular season is boring and that the playoffs are where the excitement is, well, the World Cup has reached the playoffs. The field has been cut in half, to 16. There's no more group play. Now it's sudden death -- win or go home. We've put together a handy cheat sheet on six American players that you may already know but that you could get to know even better, depending on how far Team USA goes.
Landon Donovan
Midfielder, 28
The face of U.S. soccer has seen just about everything in his international and club soccer career.
A videogame buff whose house was featured on the MTV show "Cribs" in 2006, Mr. Donovan is almost halting in his speech in public but can be fiery and tough on teammates.
He played last winter at Everton in the English Premier League and finally removed the "can't play in Europe" from his back. He hopes to return there.
Tim Howard
Goalkeeper, 31
With apologies to Mr. Donovan, Mr. Howard is probably the most valuable member of the team. A world-class goalie, Mr. Howard actually hates the position, which he calls "way too intense."
A basketball star during his New Jersey childhood, he was pushed toward soccer by his mother, who viewed its constant flow as therapy for his Tourette Syndrome.
Mr. Howard spent two seasons with Manchester United and he now plays in the EPL for Everton.
Clint Dempsey
Midfielder, 27
Talk about committed parents. Mr. Dempsey grew up in Nacogdoches, Texas, but played on a youth-club team near Dallas, forcing his parents to make a six-hour round-trip three times a week.
A tough guy, Mr. Dempsey emerged from the game against Algeria with four stitches in his chin and did postgame interviews pushing gauze against it.
It annoys him that he's unknown in the U.S. but famous in England, where he is a star for Fulham.
Jozy Altidore
Striker, 21
The youngest of the top-class U.S. players, he is 6-1, 175 pounds, but plays bigger on the field, where he uses his broad shoulders to push opponents around. Mr. Altidore drew six fouls against the Algerians and five from the Slovenians. For a striker, though, he doesn't score all that much either for the U.S. or for Hull City in England.
The child of Haitian immigrants, Mr. Altidore grew up in Florida and was discovered playing in a playground by a retired Austrian coach.
Oguchi Onyewu
Defense, 28
The son of Nigerian parents, Mr. Onyewu is the anchor of the U.S. defense when he is fit. But after two subpar games against England and Slovenia -- his failure to close in on Valter Birsa allowed the first Slovenian goal -- Mr. Onyewu doesn't appear to have recovered from a torn patellar tendon suffered in the final World Cup qualifier.
His availability against Ghana is questionable. Though he insists he's fine, he appears a step slower and doesn't have his typical elevation.
Michael Bradley
Midfielder, 22
He's the most visibly intense player on the team. The son of coach Bob Bradley, he would probably torch anyone who suggested that he made the team because of it.
He barks at reporters who ask questions he deems unworthy and worships the former Manchester United star, Roy Keane, who quit the Ireland team in the middle of the 2002 World Cup after a fight with his coach and refused a plea from the prime minister to return. Mr. Bradley never shies away from contact.

Full text: Javon Hale and Rafael Douglas, both 16, sat side by side in shackles Friday in D.C. Superior Court, co-defendants in the fatal shooting of a Salvadoran worker. And each heard testimony about what the other told police after the killing, their stories miles apart.
Hale asserted that he is innocent in the May 28 slaying of Manuel Sanchez, 29, in Southeast Washington, Detective Robert Arrington testified at a preliminary hearing. Arrington said Hale told police that he was driving near the shooting scene on the day of the homicide but that he had nothing to do with the crime.
Douglas acknowledged taking part in the attack on Sanchez, an attempted robbery gone bad, and told police that Hale was also involved, Arrington testified. But Douglas contended that neither he nor Hale pulled the trigger, the detective said. He said Douglas identified the shooter as someone he knows only as "Carlos."
Authorities allege that the two teenagers, charged as adults with first-degree murder, were lying in the interviews. On the witness stand, Arrington said one witness reported seeing Hale pull a handgun during a struggle with Sanchez, another witness identified Douglas as Hale's accomplice and both witnesses said no one else participated.
Asked by a defense attorney whether homicide detectives had sought to question "Carlos," Arrington grinned, replying, "I think the only one who knows Carlos is Mr. Douglas."
The remark prompted snickers in the courtroom, although not from the defendants. The slender youths -- Hale with shoulder-length dreadlocks, Douglas with a buzz cut -- sat silently wearing clean white sneakers and jail-issue orange jumpsuits, each handcuffed to a waist chain and manacled at the ankles.
Judge Gerald I. Fisher declined to dismiss the charges against them, rejecting arguments by defense attorneys that the prosecution's evidence is weak. And he declined to set bond, ordering the youths, who both live in Prince George's County, to remain jailed pending their trial, which has not been scheduled.
On the afternoon of May 28, Sanchez and two of his cousins, all illegal immigrants, were working at a vacant apartment building in the 4600 block of Hillside Road SE in the Benning Heights neighborhood cutting weeds and bagging trash. A 2005 Toyota 4Runner belonging to one of the cousins was parked in the back yard.
Police allege that the men were victims of a robbery attempt -- that Hale and Douglas wanted the Toyota. Hale was a ward of the D.C. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services and was let out of Boys Town, a group home, on a weekend pass just hours before the shooting. Arrington testified that on the day of the crime, Douglas was wearing an electronic monitoring device, but the detective did not specify why. The criminal records of juveniles are not publicly available.
The two youths allegedly walked up to the three workers, who were together at a rear corner of the building, and began wrestling with Sanchez and one of the others. A witness nearby later told detectives that Hale demanded, "Give me the [expletive] keys."
Hale's mother, LaShaun Hale, 43, said in interview this month that she thinks her youngest son is innocent because he told her that he is.
"The police is always putting things on my children that they ain't part of," she said.
She has two other sons: Jabraiyl Hale, 17, convicted of armed carjacking in Prince George's, could get more than a decade in prison when he is sentenced as an adult next month. Jamaal Hale, 23, arrested in March, has pleaded not guilty to abducting a man in the District, binding him with duct tape and torturing him with a heated spoon.
LaShaun Hale attended Friday's hearing, sitting in the gallery and offering criticism of Arrington's testimony in a voice loud enough to be heard at the bench. A deputy U.S. marshal finally leaned down to her, said something in a whisper, then ushered her out of the courtroom.

Full text: THE U.S. CONFERENCE of Mayors, meeting at its annual convention this month in Oklahoma City, did something extraordinary. With no dissent, the mayors called on President Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to "promptly" grant entry to 55,000 Haitian visa candidates with relatives in the United States, a measure that would result in tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in annual cash transfers flowing into Haiti's gasping economy. And what was the response from the administration, which has pledged to do all it can to alleviate the humanitarian suffering that befell Haiti in January's earthquake? Silence.
The issue here is a cohort of Haitians whose relatives live in the United States as citizens or permanent residents, and whose immigration petitions have already been approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In other words, they are on their way to the United States sooner or later anyway, once the visa backlog -- the result of quotas set by Congress -- is cleared. The main question is whether Haitians will face a wait for visas that can last from four years (for the spouses and children under 18 of legal residents of the United States) to 11 years (for siblings of U.S. citizens). Given Haiti's travails, they can and should be moved to the front of the line -- if not by the administration, then by Congress.
There is a recent precedent. Under a program launched by DHS in 2007, the United States has granted entry to about 28,000 Cubans whose family-based immigration petitions have been approved. In effect, they are allowed to wait here rather than in Cuba while the government processes their applications to become permanent residents. And while Haitians would not enjoy the same legal status as Cubans, who are eligible for green cards a year after arriving, the administration could grant them "temporary protective status" on arrival and allow them to work. With similar effect, Congress could adjust its quotas to expedite the issuance of visas to Haitians.
The mayors' resolution was remarkable because their cities -- not the federal government, not the states -- might bear the costs associated with an influx of Haitian immigrants. Many of the immigrants would be low-skilled workers with no mastery of English. In the handful of places where most would settle, services, schools and budgets would be stretched -- even as municipalities face high unemployment and anemic bank accounts.
Nonetheless, the mayors rightly cited the profound suffering in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, and the moral imperative facing America, the richest.
The Obama administration was quick and forceful in directing personnel, resources and public attention to Haiti after the Jan. 12 quake, and it has pledged large amounts of aid to rebuild the shattered country. Still, no aid program would help Haiti as much as admitting the tens of thousands of Haitians caught in the visa backlog. Remittances to Haiti amounted to about $1.5 billion last year and may reach $2 billion this year. Mr. Obama could further strengthen that lifeline.

In Little Ghana, a Big Celebration

Publication info: Wall Street Journal (Online) ; New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]26 June 2010: n/a.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/521198713?accountid=14496

In the days before the 2010 World Cup began, Akwasi Fofie had a vision. The graphic designer from Ghana, who immigrated to the United States in 1994, created a T-shirt of President Barack Obama facing Ghana president John Atta Mills, with the flags of the two countries crossed on the back. He tucked the shirt away in his Juju box, part of a sacred shrine for his Ashanti religion, and then he prayed.
Saturday morning he lifted the lid of the box and tugged the shirt over his rotund frame. And late Saturday afternoon, he stood in the middle of the street in the Bronx's Little Ghana and he danced.
"I was waiting for this moment," he declared as hundreds of Ghanaian supporters flooded raucously outside, just moments after their home country knocked the United States out of competition for the second straight World Cup, winning 2-1. "This is our time."
Pity the car that tried to cross the intersection of Sheridan and McClellan streets as the spontaneous party swallowed greater and greater swathes of the block - neighbors, children, and passersby joining in - until it became a parade that stretched down to the Grand Concourse. Revelers were serenaded with drums, wooden xylophones, improvised noisemakers and even the stray vuvuzela as the gold, red and green flag of Ghana swirled from dozens of outstretched hands.
"For the U.S., [a win] would just be a little bump in the road," said Nicholas Garbrah-Arthur, 37, who moved to the United States in 1990. "For Ghana this is everything."
Mr. Garbrah-Arthur watched the game from Papaye, a modest-sized Ghanaian restaurant at the corner sporting lace curtains, bright turquoise and black tables, and pale, striped wallpaper rising to a line of trimming patterned with palm trees.
Fans began gathering hours before the game, clustered in front of a flat-screen TV propped on a ledge in front of the window. By kickoff, every chair had been seized and people crowded along the edges of the restaurant, backs pressed against the water and soda coolers, many brandishing Ghana jerseys and flags. John Preston stood clutching a soccer ball striped with Ghana's national colors that he invited every patron to kiss before the match commenced. Many complied.
"We have three things in Ghana that we care about," said Mr. Preston, 39, who said he is studying at NYU. "Democracy, soccer and religion."
With the sound turned down on the TV, the crowd provided its own commentary, firing a stream of advice, opinions, arguments, and unvarnished and unprintable heckling, punctured by good-natured claps for stellar plays by either team and occasional bursts of song.
U.S. fan Greg Sanzone, gamely nestled at one table with a few friends, stood out among the Ghana partisans, begging the question: What was he doing here?
"We go to different ethnic enclaves for every game," said Mr. Sanzone, 26. "We thought it would be more fun to go watch the U.S. game up here than down in the Village."
He said the Ghana fans were unique from the other neighborhoods he'd experienced since his tradition of neighborhood-traveling started during the 1996 World Cup.
"A lot more social, a lot more good conversation," he said, grinning. "At other places everyone's been fixated on the games."
The food, he added, was another distinction noting that he'd tried rice balls, peanut soup, and melon seed and spinach for the first time.
"Really good -- very spicy," confirmed his girlfriend Lucinda Howells.
The American supporters finally had a chance to cheer when Landon Donovan drilled a penalty shot midway through the second half to knot the score at one. "If they win I might have to get a little obnoxious," said Mr. Sanzone with a grin, showing a stars-and-stripes skullcap he was itching to brandish.
The Ghana fans were confident it would not come to that.
"We're gonna win the game," declared Ebenezer Mkrumah, 45. But the prospect filled him with conflicted emotions.
"I'm a citizen of America but my ancestors are from Ghana," said Mr. Mkrumah, as he stood outside Papaye, waving a giant Ghana flag. "I'm sad that they're playing each other."
But not sad enough to give a second thought to rooting heartily for the Black Stars to crush their American rivals.
"You guys are here to avenge," said Appenteng Mante, referencing 2006 when Ghana eliminated the United States from World Cup play. "But I know we're going to score again."
His prediction would prove prescient. In the third minute of extra time, Asamoah Gyan lifted the ball past the lunge of goalie Tim Howard. As the ball flew into the net, everyone at Papaye's exploded to their feet, screaming, "We did it! We did it!"
Some tore of their shirts. Others lifted friends into the air. Thunderous singing rocked the restaurant, with tables turned into impromptu drum sets, as everyone swayed, clapped, and bellowed the words.
"We're calling for God's spirit to come and help us," 37-year old Peter Kessie translated to a visitor. "That's what the song means."
Mr. Fofie's prayers, at least, had been answered. And before he danced away in a spontaneous procession up the Grand Concourse, he had a second prediction: "This is the first time that the World Cup is being held in Africa and you know what team is going to do it?" he asked. There was no need to answer, but he did anyway. He smiled. "Ghana."

Full text: Re "Unions are not the culprits," Column, June 21
George Skelton is correct that Gov. Schwarzenegger's budget, tax and pension reforms would not erase this year's deficit. But they would erase our kids' deficits.
Were the governor's reforms in place 11 years ago, today's deficit would be a fraction of its $19-billion size and the state would not have $500 billion in pension debt.
Every year, journalists get distracted by the current budget deficit and take their eyes off reforms that would stop deficits from being created in the first place. Tax increases become a "necessity." That rewards the behavior that got us here in the first place.
This year's deficit has everything to do with legislators bowing to the demands of public employee unions. The numbers prove it: State spending on employee compensation and benefits is up 65% over the last 10 years. Former Speaker Willie Brown has it right: When 80% of every revenue dollar goes to employee compensation and benefits, budget deficits won't be solved until legislators free themselves from union influence.
David Crane
Sacramento
The writer is special advisor to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger for jobs and economic growth.
::
Skelton correctly points out that Proposition 13 hamstrings the state's ability to correct its fiscal imbalances.
Proposition 13 is a cancer on the state that shifts taxes to California's struggling younger residents while those literally "grandfathered" in enjoy property taxes that were last fair when a house could be had for the price of today's used car. There needs to be a correction that allows younger Californians some reprieve from a future of ever-increasing taxes and decreased services.
On the spending side, the 14% cuts in average public employee pay effected in 2009 do not begin to bring public service compensation in line with comparable jobs in the private sector. Most people I know would consider working for the state a dream job, given the lavish benefits, security and pay and the lack of other jobs.
Courageous politicians should fix Proposition 13 and cut public pay to real-world levels.
Ron Homer
Manhattan Beach
::
Yes, Proposition 13 resulted in some unfairness and some chaos, but will you please stop Skelton and other columnists from avowing that it "slashed" property taxes?
It did not; it reined in increases in taxes brought about by skyrocketing inflation in property values.
Politicians took advantage of a bonanza in tax income by not adjusting the tax rates, and many people faced losing their homes because they could not pay such increases.
It must be understood that "property value" is not an account from which people can draw to pay for taxes (or anything else). It is a meaningless number until an actual sale takes place, and thus is a very poor indicator of how taxes should be assessed.
Let's develop a better, fairer way to tax all property -- be it private, business or government.

Crossing lines on border reform
Re "An immigration standoff," Opinion, June 21
Tamar Jacoby has been an advocate for amnesty for illegal immigrants, and visas for even more immigrants, for years. She is essentially part of the "open borders" lobby.
The U.S. is struggling with high unemployment, government budget deficits, overcrowded and severely strained public facilities such as hospitals and jails, all of which are made worse by uncontrolled immigration.
We don't need "comprehensive immigration reform." We need to suspend mass immigration, for at least five years, to catch our breath. Polls have shown that a majority of Americans want legal immigration reduced, and illegal immigration stopped, period.
Limit immigration to selected individuals, with specific education and needed skills. The U.S. is not an empty country anymore.
Mike Burns
Bakersfield
::
Wow. I can't believe it. A clear-eyed, reasoned, nuanced approach to Arizona's SB 1070. We are already polarized on this issue beyond all sense.
Perhaps Jacoby can get the ear of the Obama administration and convince them with these arguments. Could happen, but it doesn't seem likely.

The qualities of Terry Cannon
Re "An award and a pink slip," Column, June 23
Uncharacteristically, Steve Lopez missed part of the story in his otherwise excellent column on the layoff of Alhambra High's employee of the year, Terry Cannon.
What Lopez missed was hiding in plain sight, in the Tommy Lasorda bobble head next to Cannon's computer: Cannon is founder of the Baseball Reliquary, which recently hosted a celebration of the former Dodgers manager called "Lasordapalooza."
Every year Cannon teaches me something about the history of baseball and America by calling attention to the underappreciated athletes, managers and sportswriters whom he proudly inducts into the Baseball Reliquary's "Shrine of the Eternals."
How lucky Cannon's library-using students have been to have him as their guide to the resources and research tools at their hands -- and how unfortunate that Alhambra High may not keep him at his invaluable post.
Let us hope that as a result of Lopez's moving portrait Alhambra may reconsider.

Grilling our fathers
Re "Happy [expletive] Father's Day," and "Is the man you call Dad really your father?," Opinion, June 20
My Father's Day got off to a good start. My wife gave me a tongue-in-cheek card. My daughter, who has a knack for coming up with thoughtful gifts despite my protestations that I really have everything I need, gave me a cap from the German soccer team.
My euphoria quickly turned into anger once I got to the Opinion pages of The Times. Did we really need to read about Justin Halpern's boorish father? Oh, I get it now -- there is really a spark of wisdom and fatherly love hidden beneath all those expletives. Big deal!
And then Marlene Zuk's piece, which asks if "the man you call Dad" is really your father?
Funny, that question had never occurred to me, nor I suspect to most who read this red herring of inappropriateness.
But what a wonderful issue to raise on Father's Day. Why don't we all ask our fathers, just to make sure. It will make their day, just as it did mine.

Abstract: Winmid From: latimes.com :: So 3.4 million U.S. viewers from this new "middle class" chose to watch fictionalized kids on "Kate Plus 8" instead of spending quality time with their own kids. True, the special effects were on the cheesy, low-budget side, but for a writing-directing debut, the film was an inventive take on the push-pull issues of immigration, an out-of-control military-industrial complex and environmental brinkmanship.

I'm afraid Sarah Palin's Alaska won't be very diverse. ["TLC: Hooking the Heartland," June 20] Will she explore the poor and recession-riddled Alaska? Will she stop by the ghetto part of Alaska? Will she explore the gay and lesbian part of Alaska? Will she discuss oil exploration and the aftermath of Exxon Valdez? She has been so hostile to the environment of Alaska because she so desperately wants that oil money.
The world is changing, and people's children are smarter than most people think. Give me a break. Who defines what America should be?

Other reason for German flight
Mr. Timberg leaves out one important fact on the German influx to America in the '30s: A great percentage of these people were like me, Jews fleeing Hitler's Germany while the immigration door was still open ["L.A.'s German Accent," June 20]. Half of Germany's Jews fled prior to or right after the beginning of the war on the Western Front, with many going to several adjoining countries that were themselves overrun by Germany as the war progressed. We arrived in the USA on Sept. 2, 1939, one day after Germany invaded Poland and WWII started.
In January 1933, there were about 525,000 Jews in Germany, and by October 1941, when Germany shut the doors to Jews emigrating, there were 163,000 Jews left there. About 130,000 of these remaining Jews were murdered in Nazi ghettos and death camps.
The USA admitted 95,000 European Jews under its combined country quotas prior to the time that Germany stopped Jewish immigration from countries under its control.
The bottom line is that people like Billy Wilder, Albert Einstein and my family did not come to America because they wanted to leave Germany; they left because they had to.

Getting a sense of Janelle Monae
I saw Janelle Monae open for Grace Jones last year at the Hollywood Bowl ["Mix-N-Match," June 20]. My reaction was, who is this crazy person doing a melismatic rendition of a smile? However, I heard her interview with NPR and I decided to buy her "ArchAndroid" album. I am completely hooked. I also bought her "Metropolis" album.
What Lady Gaga tries to do with her outlandish outfits, Monae does with her songwriting.

Calling out Casey Affleck
So Casey Affleck doesn't want to be reminded how brilliant he is ["The Actor Inside," June 20]? Well, let's honor his request. I found the high-pitched pipsqueak completely unbelievable as a tough guy in "Gone Baby Gone." I don't see the skinny lad as a killer sheriff either, despite what the critics say.
Affleck, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal are soft boys trying to play tough grown-ups.

Hey, Casey! Whaddaya mean there haven't been any good sci-fi films lately? What about last year's "Sleep Dealer"?

Full text: Strolling down an aisle with hands clasped behind his back at the fourth annual Leimert Park Village Book Fair, Otis Wright noticed significant changes in the event as it unfolded Saturday in a neighborhood known as the cultural heartbeat of black Los Angeles.
Like similar literary festivals across the nation, the fair featured fiction, nonfiction, poetry and children's literature by 150 African American writers, as well as readings, panel discussions and performances by singers, including a Lena Horne impersonator.
The thousands of visitors who turned out had plenty of opportunities to meet authors and celebrities such as Oscar winner Lou Gossett Jr.
But Wright, 72, a real estate broker and minister who has lived in the Leimert Park Village area for 55 years, was particularly pleased by what he described as "progress: more people, a younger crowd this year, and lots more children. I like that."
Nearby, 9-year-year-old Jada Salazar was exploring rows of long tables where dozens of independent authors were showing off their self-published efforts.
"It's so inspiring that as soon as I get home I am going to write something about it," said Salazar, vice president of the student body at Saturn Street Elementary School in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles. "I'm going to write about all the authors selling books and the people singing on stage."
The festival was founded in 2007 by Cynthia E. Exum and Associates in partnership with Los Angeles Councilman Bernard C. Parks, whose district includes the southwest Los Angeles neighborhood rich with Art Deco apartments and office buildings, Afrocentric boutiques and shops such as Eso Won Books.
In a kickoff activity Saturday, Parks presided over the unveiling of a 44-cent U.S. postage stamp honoring Oscar Micheaux, the son of former slaves who went on to write, produce and direct 44 feature-length films between 1919 and 1948.
"This festival can be appreciated on many levels," Parks said. "It is a celebration of the written word and presents role models from famous actors to little-known artists just starting to make their mark. It is also an economic stimulus because the crowds of book-lovers spill over into local shops and restaurants -- and it's getting bigger."
Invited authors included Scot Brown, author of "Fighting for US: Maulana Karenga, the US Organization, and Black Cultural Nationalism"; Douglas A. Blackmon, author of "Slavery by Another Name"; and fashion consultant Daisy Lewellyn, author of "In Style With the Queen of Effortless Chic."
On a panel about a collection of scholarly essays titled "Black Los Angeles: American Dreams and Racial Realities," Paul Robinson, director of the Medical Geographic Information Systems Laboratory at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, presented a history of Los Angeles from its founding in 1781 by Spaniards of mostly African descent to the first decade of the 2000s, a time when the cultural fabric of American-born blacks is being challenged by new immigrants from the Caribbean and Africa.
These new immigrants share the same living spaces, he said, but have different cultural backgrounds and social identities.
Leimert Park is a microcosm of those changes. Developed in the late 1920s, the neighborhood was restricted to whites and known for its golf courses and several airstrips. Howard Hughes learned to fly there.
The area began attracting African American musicians and artists after the 1965 Watts riots.
The Leimert Park Village shopping district features Jamaican shops and restaurants and Southern-style eateries offering live jazz.
The bustling neighborhood surrounding the intersection of West 43rd Place and Degnan Boulevard celebrates Kwanzaa and Christmas and is the last stop on the annual parade honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
Noted philanthropists Bernard and Shirley Kinsey, whose extensive collection of art, books and manuscripts chronicle the African American experience from 1632 to the present, know the area well.
They are coauthors of "The Kinsey Collection," a 155-page coffee-table edition that Bernard Kinsey said "is more about the African American experience in terms of 'How we overcame' than 'Isn't it awful?' "
Surveying the passersby, many of them with children in tow, Kinsey smiled and said: "I love what I see here today. This is the soul of the African American experience in Los Angeles. We are privileged to be a part of it."

Full text: MEXICO CITY -- From perfecting their use of the subjunctive in colonial Puebla to exploring the anthropological aspects of Tijuana's gritty underside, American college students have long used Mexico as a learning lab. This summer, however, far fewer will be venturing across the border, as universities and students alike fear the violence tied to drug gangs that have caught some innocents in the cross-fire.
In March, two Mexican university students were killed at the prestigious Tecnologico de Monterrey when fighting broke out between Mexican soldiers and drug traffickers on the streets outside. Universities in the border cities of Ciudad Juarez and Reynosa have seen violence tread dangerously close to their campuses as well.
A direct result of the attention-getting bloodshed has been the mass cancellation of study-abroad programs throughout the country, including those hundreds of miles from the most dangerous areas. Some educators on both sides of the border consider the reaction to be an exaggerated response.
"To make an analogy," said Geoffrey E. Braswell, an associate anthropology professor at the University of California, San Diego, "I would not have considered taking students to Mississippi during the early 1960s or to Chicago during the 1968 Democratic convention, but other parts of the U.S. were of course safe for travel. Mexico is that way."
This fall, Professor Braswell plans to help students understand ancient Mesoamerica by visiting 28 archaeological sites and numerous other museums in central Mexico.
No American students are known to be have been hurt in the violence, and Mexico is not the first country to find many of its foreign students are staying away. Israel, Kenya and Haiti have all experienced the temporary shutdown of study-abroad programs after the State Department issued warnings about traveling there.
The University of Kansas had 18 students ready to fine-tune their Spanish skills this summer in Puebla, southeast of Mexico City. Then multiple killings in distant Ciudad Juarez in March prompted the State Department to issue a travel warning for northern Mexico. The university canceled its Puebla program, geography aside.
As a matter of policy, the University of Kansas bans study abroad anywhere in a country with an official travel warning, even if the danger being cited is nowhere near where the program will be. In a last-minute switch, the Kansas students were shifted to Costa Rica.
"It's a blanket policy even if there are areas that are safe," said Sue Lorenz, director of the Office of Study Abroad at the University of Kansas. "We have a pretty cautious policy."
California State University, which has 23 campuses, similarly banned all university-sponsored activities in Mexico after the State Department warning in March.
But it allows the chancellor to issue waivers on a case-by-case basis for areas not specifically mentioned in the warning. About a dozen waivers have been issued for programs in Puebla, Guadalajara, Guanajuato, Oaxaca and Queretaro. But Tijuana, just across the border from San Diego State University, part of the California State University System, did not make the list of safe locales, much to the frustration of many students and professors.
Over the past 11 years, Victor Clark Alfaro, a lecturer at San Diego State University, has led field trips in Tijuana's red-light district to let his students see firsthand how Mexicans regulate vice. He has lured smugglers out of the shadows and into his class. A big believer that studying the border requires actually being there, he has piled his students into a bus to show them one of Mexico's most important trading posts.
"It's like any large city in the world," Mr. Clark said of his native Tijuana. "You take precautions."
Mr. Clark said that none of his students had experienced any dangerous episodes during their chaperoned study visits. Exposure to the bustling city, he contends, has given his students, all of whom speak Spanish, great insight into another culture. "We had an educational advantage being at the border, being able to study both sides," he said.
Ironically, Mr. Clark noted that violence in Tijuana is down considerably this year compared with the previous two years, when his classes were allowed. Still, in an indication of just how subjective danger is, he defended the relative safety of Tijuana by declaring, "It's not Juarez."
Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, has had more drug-related killings than any other Mexican city in recent years. Still, some boosters there insist it remains safe for American students to study. The Mexican Solidarity Network, a Chicago nonprofit group that holds study-abroad programs in Mexico, recently canceled its Ciudad Juarez summer program, which was to begin this month, not for fear of bloodshed but because of a lack of interest.
Tom Hansen, the group's international education director, said the Ciudad Juarez program was managed by an experienced local labor organizer who knows the dangerous parts of the city and enforces a dawn-to-dusk curfew for students. Parental permission is required.
"I think that Ciudad Juarez is a challenging place," he said. "You can't send undisciplined students there. I wouldn't send students who weren't fluent in Spanish. People get in trouble when they don't know what they're getting into."
It is not hard to understand why few students signed up for the Ciudad Juarez program, which is intended to highlight issues like immigration and trade. The promotional material for the program, in the interest of full disclosure, noted, "Currently Ciudad Juarez is under a virtual state of siege."
In advising students, the Mexican Solidarity Network said on its Web site: "When thinking about safety in Ciudad Juarez, think in terms of major metropolitan areas in the U.S. such as Detroit, East St. Louis, New York City or Chicago. There are parts of each of these cities where the murder rate is nearly as high as Ciudad Juarez, and university students would be well advised to avoid those areas. This does not mean that the entire city is dangerous."
Or the entire country.
The group still has programs in Mexico City, Tlaxcala and Chiapas State, all of which Mr. Hansen said also used experienced local contacts to keep students safe.
"If you have a professor from the United States who goes to Mexico City every five years and hangs out in the Zona Rosa and doesn't understand the culture or how to orient the students, that will make the program more dangerous," he said, referring to a popular entertainment district in the capital.
Until the restrictions on Tijuana study are lifted, Mr. Clark has had to alter his educational approach. He plans to take his San Diego students to the border, but not across it, to spend time with the Border Patrol. And he will use video conferencing to allow Tijuana immigrant smugglers and sex workers to speak to the students -- without ever having the class leave American soil.

Full text: Early one morning in March, two Chicago-area brothers were dozing on an Amtrak train when it stopped in Buffalo, N.Y.
A pair of uniformed Border Patrol agents made their way through the car, asking passengers if they were U.S. citizens. No, the vacationing siblings answered honestly, with flat, Midwestern inflections: We're citizens of Mexico.
And so it was that college students Carlos Robles, 20, and his brother Rafael, 19 -- both former captains of the varsity tennis team at northwest suburban Palatine High School -- found themselves in jail, facing deportation.
Their secret was out: Despite their upbringing in middle America, their academic success and their network of native-born friends, they had no permission to be in the United States. Their parents had brought them here illegally as children.
The Robleses, now out of jail but fighting removal in Immigration Court, are among thousands of young illegal immigrants in similar situations, living at risk of being expelled to countries they barely remember.
They are known in some circles as "Dream Act" kids, named after proposed legislation that would grant them legal status. This month, a Harvard University student who came from Mexico at age 4, Eric Balderas, joined their ranks after he was arrested by immigration agents at the San Antonio Airport.
Their cases underscore a conflict in the Obama administration's approach to immigration enforcement. Even though the president supports the Dream Act -- which would provide a path to legalization for illegal immigrants brought here as children who enroll either in college or the military -- his enforcement bureaucracy continues to pursue deportation cases against the increasing number of students who would be protected by it. It's part of a push that is on track to remove a record 400,000 illegal immigrants this year.
"It highlights the inconsistencies in immigration policies," said William Perez, a Claremont Graduate University professor and author of a book about illegal-immigrant students called "We Are Americans."
Immigration authorities say they use their discretion and rarely deport students, particularly once their teachers, coaches, friends and elected representatives speak out on their behalf.
Balderas, for example, was placed in "deferred status," meaning the government won't remove him unless he gets in trouble. But even so, the young people remain in legal limbo, often unable to land a professional job once earning a degree.
"These cases illustrate the need for comprehensive immigration reform," said Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "ICE uses its discretion on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate."
Carlos and Rafael Robles were on the way to visit a friend at Harvard -- not Balderas -- when they were arrested. They spent a weekend in jail before friends posted $5,000 bond apiece. They had to travel to Buffalo again recently for a court hearing after an immigration judge turned down their request to move their case to Chicago. Their next court date is next year.
Their father works for a car dealer, and their mother is an assistant at a mortgage company. They came to the U.S. by airplane five years ago on tourist visas and never went back.
"We want to go to school and to work here," Carlos Robles said.
Several members of their community have written letters on their behalf, said Robert Carroll, a teacher at Palatine High School.
"Gee whiz, these are just two quality kids," he said. "They are everything you would want your kids to be. These kids are going to be leaders in their communities -- taxpayers, not tax recipients."
The Dream Act, sponsored by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and others, came up eight votes short in the Senate in 2007, when an effort to overhaul immigration law fell apart. The following year, then-candidate Barack Obama urged its passage during a presidential debate. But Obama has done little to push the bill as president.
Some opponents say the measure would grant "amnesty" to a far larger circle of illegal immigrants than the college students who have become the faces of the movement.

Full text: On the eve of Elena Kagan's Senate confirmation hearings, her records on race in the Clinton White House and at Harvard Law School are producing discomfort among some leading civil rights organizations, leaving them struggling to decide whether they want her to join the Supreme Court.
Their reservations have introduced the first substantive division among liberals in what has otherwise been a low-key partisan debate over Kagan's merits to replace Justice John Paul Stevens. The uncertainty among some on the left is particularly striking, given that she was nominated by the nation's first black president.
Decades after the height of the civil rights movement, questions involving race and ethnicity persist as a recurrent theme before the Supreme Court, and attitudes on those issues remain a significant prism through which nominees are evaluated by those on the left and the right.
The National Bar Association, the main organization of black lawyers, has refrained from endorsing Kagan, giving her a lukewarm rating. The group's president, Mavis T. Thompson, said it "had some qualms" about Kagan's statements on crack-cocaine sentencing and what it regards as her inadequate emphasis while dean at Harvard Law School on diversifying the school along racial and ethnic lines. Others have expressed reservations about Kagan's views on affirmative action, racial profiling and immigration.
Several liberal groups that are stalwarts on civil rights matters have uncharacteristically hung back, trying to persuade Democratic senators to press her on such issues during the hearings set to begin Monday. Some, including the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, say they are still trying to glean her beliefs from fragmentary evidence. Others have parsed Kagan's public statements and actions and said they are uneasy.
"This is a complicated nomination," said Barbara R. Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which decided last week not to take a position yet on Kagan. "There isn't a judicial record to review, indicating her views on critical civil rights matters," Arnwine said. "And otherwise, the civil rights record that exists is thin and mixed."
The lingering doubts mean that the White House has not fully tamped down reservations from the left that surfaced immediately after President Obama nominated Kagan in early May. That contrasts with the outpouring of support from the civil rights community -- and a central line of objection from conservatives -- over Obama's selection a year ago of now-Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose strong Latina identity, rather than her judicial philosophy, was a defining aspect of her candidacy.
Republicans have been critical of Kagan on other grounds, focusing on what they characterize as her liberal philosophy and, more specifically, her refusal to sponsor military recruiters for a period while dean at Harvard Law. White House officials have said that she would prove to be an impartial justice. And they have rebutted the critique of Kagan on race, noting, for example, that the law school's final hiring decisions were made by committee.
No Senate Democrats have signaled that they are wavering on Kagan's confirmation. But the hesitancy within parts of the civil rights community is a reminder that, when it comes to a lifetime seat on the nation's highest court, presidential allies can prove as vexing as opponents. In 2005, criticism from conservatives prompted President George W. Bush to rescind the short-lived nomination of White House Counsel Harriet Miers.
Some women's groups have come forward to support Kagan. So have the NAACP and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. The latter issued a detailed report on her record, concluding that she possesses "an impeccable legal biography." Still, the group cited "some concerns" and emphasized that the "nature and extent of Elena Kagan's record on civil rights" makes it especially important for the Senate Judiciary Committee to explore "all . . . areas affecting equal opportunity and racial justice."
Other liberal organizations are in an awkward spot, wary of Kagan but reluctant to criticize the White House explicitly. "We really did struggle with this," Thompson said of the National Bar Association's decision to give Kagan the mid-level rating of "qualified" rather than an outright endorsement. "Of course, we want to support President Obama. But . . . I have to make sure I am true to the mission of the National Bar," whose 44,000 members are predominantly African American.
Such uneasiness comes in part from a handful of the many records made public this month from Kagan's time in the Clinton White House counsel's office and as deputy director for domestic policy. The discomfort is reinforced by the recollections of some colleagues and outside civil rights activists with whom Kagan interacted during her White House years. Others have noted that no black or Latino faculty members were hired into a tenure-track position during the six years that she was Harvard Law School's dean.
The Clinton-era records reflect pointed disagreements about racial matters between Kagan and Christopher Edley, a legal academic who worked in the White House and remained a consultant on a Clinton race initiative after returning to Harvard to teach. Now dean at the University of California at Berkeley School of Law, Edley has been close to Obama, dispensing pointed advice to his campaign staff.
When Edley wrote to Clinton in 1999 urging him to incorporate a ban on racial profiling into his race initiative, Kagan and her boss, domestic policy adviser Bruce N. Reed, objected. "This simply cannot be allowed to happen," read a note in Kagan's handwriting.
The previous year, Edley fired off a note, saying he had been unable to get Kagan's attention. He wanted to discuss a policy she favored prohibiting social promotion in schools. He opposed the idea, saying research has shown it would be counterproductive for poor, minority students. "I have tried email, voice mail, hallway greeting, and conversation with her secretary," Edley wrote of Kagan, saying that he hoped to discuss the policy to "avoid the problem of deciding . . . whether I need to resign."
In the only interview he has given about Kagan, Edley told The Washington Post that she had displayed a "reluctance to engage race directly," but he added: "In jobs like that, it's often difficult to discern whether someone is speaking in their own voice or representing a superior."
Edley said that "nobody ever detected daylight between Bruce and Elena" but that "I really do not feel comfortable inferring from that anything about her personal views on social policy, much less on the bench."
Reed confirmed that Kagan and he had been skeptical of the race initiative, with its emphasis on using the presidency as a bully pulpit for a national conversation about ongoing racism. "We both felt that the administration had a responsibility to propose concrete actions that would expand opportunity," Reed said, "and not just have a conversation that called attention to the problem and didn't do anything about it."
Alexis M. Herman, who served as Labor secretary in Clinton's second term, said Kagan had supported a minority youth jobs initiative that Herman had promoted.
Mary Frances Berry, at the time chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, recalled Kagan as "argumentative and smart," often taking "a skeptical attitude about the arguments people made. . . . On the Civil Rights Commission, her first kind of question would be, 'Why do we need one?' "
Berry, along with some of the activists combing Kagan's public record, say they are uncertain of the nominee's personal views. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, for instance, is trying to interpret a note by Kagan in which she dismissed as "lots of legal gobbledygook" arguments about how to treat Central Americans displaced by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.
MALDEF President Thomas Saenz said that "there are certain absences in the record" regarding Kagan. "And, therefore, there are questions to be asked."

Full text: In 1848, the discovery of gold brought hordes of prospectors to California. In 1889, millions of acres of free land set off a rush of settlers into Oklahoma. Today, we are told, the chance to get U.S. citizenship for their unborn children is rapidly filling the country with illegal immigrants.
Critics see this as a malignant phenomenon that ought to be stopped. So Arizona state Sen. Russell Pearce, author of the new law directing police to check the immigration status of people they stop whom they suspect of being here illegally, has another idea: denying citizenship privileges to anyone born in his state to undocumented parents.
He plans to offer legislation refusing a birth certificate to any child unless a parent can prove legal residence, a clever attempt to nullify birthright citizenship. He says the change would eliminate "the greatest inducement for breaking our laws," since having an "anchor baby" yields all sorts of benefits.
A Rasmussen poll found a plurality of Americans favor repealing birthright citizenship. Kentucky Republican Senate nominee Rand Paul has endorsed legislation to that end, which has attracted 91 sponsors in the U.S. House. Groups like the Federation for American Immigration Reform are all for it.
But the idea fails on a couple of grounds. The first is constitutional. The policy originates with the 14th Amendment, ratified after the Civil War, which says, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States."
Pearce and his allies say illegal immigrants can be excluded because they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. But that provision was included only to exempt children born to foreign diplomats.
The Supreme Court has left little room for argument. In 1898, it ruled that birth on American soil is "declared by the Constitution to constitute a sufficient and complete right to citizenship."
In 1982, it concluded that illegal immigrants are indeed "within the jurisdiction" of the state where they are present. To deny a U.S.-born child a birth certificate would almost certainly violate the right to the equal protection of the laws.
It would be bad for common-sense reasons as well. To start with, it would call into question the status of every new baby. A report by the Immigration Policy Center pointed out that "all American parents would, going forward, have to prove the citizenship of their children through a cumbersome bureaucratic process."
This obligation is not something "we" are going to impose on "them." It would be a burden on all new parents, including those whose ancestors debarked at Plymouth Rock.
Supporters of the change regard birthright citizenship as an irresistible magnet for foreigners to sneak in. But the effect is vastly exaggerated.
One study cited in Peter Brimelow's 1996 anti-immigration screed, "Alien Nation," found that 15 percent of new Hispanic mothers whose babies were born in Southern California hospitals said they came over the border to give birth, with 25 percent of that group saying they did so to gain citizenship for the child.
But this evidence actually contradicts the claim. It means that 96 percent of these women were not lured by the desire to have an "anchor baby."
That makes perfect sense. The value of a citizen child is too remote to compete with the other attractions that draw people to come illegally -- such as jobs and opportunity unavailable in their native countries.
True, an undocumented adult can be sponsored for a resident visa by a citizen child -- but not till the kid reaches age 21. To imagine that Mexicans are risking their lives crossing the border in 2010 to gain legal status in 2031 assumes they put an excessive weight on the distant future.
Nor are the other alleged freebies very enticing. Some of the main benefits available to undocumented foreigners, such as emergency room care and public education for children, don't require them to have a U.S. citizen child. Illegal immigrant parents are ineligible for welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and the like. They can be deported.
Barring citizenship to their newborn babies wouldn't make these families pack up and go home. It would just put the kids into a legal jeopardy that impedes their assimilation into American society -- without appreciably diminishing the number of people going over, under, around or through the border fence.
Punishing innocents without accomplishing anything useful? The opponents of birthright citizenship need an anchor in reality.

Abstract: The Supreme Court has regularly upheld birthright citizenship, most recently in 1982 in Plyler v. Doe, in which all nine justices agreed that the 14th Amendment applied to legal and illegal immigrants alike, and a majority ruled that Texas had to offer public school education to children of illegal immigrants.

Full text: They are called "anchor babies" -- the children born in the United States of illegal immigrant parents -- and pressure is growing to change the meaning of the 14th Amendment so as to deny them automatic citizenship.
Ninety-one members of Congress have signed on as co-sponsors of a bill to do just that. It was submitted in the House last year by Georgia Republican Nathan Deal. Backers of Arizona's harsh anti-immigrant measure are drafting legislation that would withhold birth certificates from these babies. Similar measures are being proposed in other states.
The United States is one of the few countries in the world that bestows "birthright citizenship." Opponents of the practice say that it induces immigrants to enter the country illegally with the devious strategy of having a baby as a citizen "anchor," through which the rest of the family can petition to stay and get access to American jobs and welfare.
But ending birthright citizenship might be the worst idea of the immigration debate. It strikes at the core of American identity, punishes all Americans by requiring them to prove their citizenship, overthrows two centuries of legislative intent and court rulings, and accomplishes next to nothing in resolving illegal immigration.
The 14th Amendment states: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."
The abrogationists would reinterpret the phrase "and subject to the jurisdiction thereof." They argue that unauthorized immigrants are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction and that Congress, acting in 1866 at the end of the Civil War, meant for the amendment to apply only to recently freed slaves.
Go back, however, and read the transcripts of the 1866 debate in the Senate and you find that both those for and against the amendment readily acknowledged its application to illegal immigrants. A Pennsylvania senator, for example, objected to granting citizenship to the children of aliens who regularly commit "trespass" within the United States. The concern then was with babies of gypsy or Chinese parents.
But Congress and the ratifying states opted instead to uphold a founding principle of the republic that was fundamental to the peaceful building of a multiethnic immigrant nation, however imperfectly. In a world plagued by bloody ethnic conflicts, that concern remains valid.
The Supreme Court has regularly upheld birthright citizenship, most recently in 1982 in Plyler v. Doe, in which all nine justices agreed that the 14th Amendment applied to legal and illegal immigrants alike, and a majority ruled that Texas had to offer public school education to children of illegal immigrants.
Abrogating birthright citizenship additionally would create practical chaos. All Americans would have to prove their citizenship. Birth certificates would no longer do. Yet we lack a national registry of who is a citizen.
As West Point professor Margaret Stock says: "The government would have to adjudicate the citizenship status of every child born within U.S. borders based on the exceedingly complex rules of derivative citizenship, or citizenship by blood. Currently, [it] takes more than a year to make such determinations, and the process is expensive and fraught with error."
The abrogationists confuse the historical ecosystem on the U.S.-Mexican border with illegal immigrants in general. Pregnant Mexican women from border towns do commonly cross just to have a baby in the United States. But their extended families have often straddled the border for a century or more. The women tend to be middle class, pre-pay the hospitals in cash and go home, though their children can someday return.
A handful of tourists do the same, but the total of all these is minuscule. Significant are the 4 million children in 2008 with one or more unauthorized immigrant parents spread throughout the country, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Repeated studies, however, show that their parents came for jobs or to join family. The children were normal byproducts of life, and not an immigration strategy. The parents are not eligible for welfare or for citizenship until after the child turns 21.
Improved enforcement has dramatically slowed the flow of illegal immigration. What's needed now is comprehensive immigration reform to finish the job. Talk of birthright citizenship is an unwise diversion.

Full text: THE U.S. CONFERENCE of Mayors, meeting at its annual convention this month in Oklahoma City, did something extraordinary. With no dissent, the mayors called on President Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to "promptly" grant entry to 55,000 Haitian visa candidates with relatives in the United States, a measure that would result in tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in annual cash transfers flowing into Haiti's gasping economy. And what was the response from the administration, which has pledged to do all it can to alleviate the humanitarian suffering that befell Haiti in January's earthquake? Silence.
The issue here is a cohort of Haitians whose relatives live in the United States as citizens or permanent residents, and whose immigration petitions have already been approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In other words, they are on their way to the United States sooner or later anyway, once the visa backlog -- the result of quotas set by Congress -- is cleared. The main question is whether Haitians will face a wait for visas that can last from four years (for the spouses and children under 18 of legal residents of the United States) to 11 years (for siblings of U.S. citizens). Given Haiti's travails, they can and should be moved to the front of the line -- if not by the administration, then by Congress.
There is a recent precedent. Under a program launched by DHS in 2007, the United States has granted entry to about 28,000 Cubans whose family-based immigration petitions have been approved. In effect, they are allowed to wait here rather than in Cuba while the government processes their applications to become permanent residents. And while Haitians would not enjoy the same legal status as Cubans, who are eligible for green cards a year after arriving, the administration could grant them "temporary protective status" on arrival and allow them to work. With similar effect, Congress could adjust its quotas to expedite the issuance of visas to Haitians.
The mayors' resolution was remarkable because their cities -- not the federal government, not the states -- might bear the costs associated with an influx of Haitian immigrants. Many of the immigrants would be low-skilled workers with no mastery of English. In the handful of places where most would settle, services, schools and budgets would be stretched -- even as municipalities face high unemployment and anemic bank accounts.
Nonetheless, the mayors rightly cited the profound suffering in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, and the moral imperative facing America, the richest.
The Obama administration was quick and forceful in directing personnel, resources and public attention to Haiti after the Jan. 12 quake, and it has pledged large amounts of aid to rebuild the shattered country. Still, no aid program would help Haiti as much as admitting the tens of thousands of Haitians caught in the visa backlog. Remittances to Haiti amounted to about $1.5 billion last year and may reach $2 billion this year. Mr. Obama could further strengthen that lifeline.

The GOP's rising Latino connection

Author: Garcia, David Alire

Publication info: Los Angeles Times ; Los Angeles, Calif. [Los Angeles, Calif]27 June 2010: A.32.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/521284571?accountid=14496

Abstract: In Nevada, former federal judge Brian Sandoval -- a George W. Bush appointee -- knocked off incumbent Gov. Jim Gibbons to win the GOP gubernatorial nomination. [...] in New Mexico -- perhaps the most illustrative proving ground for this new Latino Republican winning streak -- not only did local prosecutor Susana Martinez win a hard-fought GOP primary for governor, but businessman and former state Rep. John Sanchez easily defeated the primary competition for lieutenant governor. Arizona may temporarily be moving in the opposite direction with the state's recently passed immigration law and its anti-immigrant political fallout for the Republican Party, but the basic political calculus remains.

Full text: In the long-running contest to win Latino voters' hearts and minds, the Republican Party jumped out to a stunning lead this month.
And for a party saddled with leaders displaying more than a few retrograde impulses these days -- on immigration and even the landmark Civil Rights Act -- that's no small accomplishment.
Consider the recent string of Latino Republicans to triumph in GOP primaries in three states over the last few weeks: In California, appointed Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado won his six-way Republican primary with 43% of the vote and the right to fight for a full term this fall. In Nevada, former federal judge Brian Sandoval -- a George W. Bush appointee -- knocked off incumbent Gov. Jim Gibbons to win the GOP gubernatorial nomination.
And in New Mexico -- perhaps the most illustrative proving ground for this new Latino Republican winning streak -- not only did local prosecutor Susana Martinez win a hard-fought GOP primary for governor, but businessman and former state Rep. John Sanchez easily defeated the primary competition for lieutenant governor.
"It is historic from the standpoint that never before have there been ... Republican Hispanics running for governor and lieutenant governor at the same time," former Interior secretary and former 10-term GOP New Mexico Rep. Manuel Lujan Jr. told me in an interview. In practically the next breath, Lujan added, "We've had Hispanic governors for years here in New Mexico, for decades." That's true, but you have to go back nearly nine decades to find the last Latino Republican elected governor.
Today, tiny New Mexico (population: 2 million) is the state with the largest percentage of Latinos (45%) most of whom are native-born. As Lujan points out, the state has elected numerous Latinos to top jobs for a very long time. In 1928, New Mexico sent the first elected Latino U.S. senator -- Chihuahua-born Octaviano Larrazolo, a Republican -- to Washington. But since then nearly every Latino to win statewide has been a Democrat.
The newly minted Martinez-Sanchez ticket threatens to upend that history.
In part, the recent GOP Latino winning streak can be explained by simple strategic considerations: Latino Republican candidates have obvious crossover appeal to Latino Democrats, and GOP leaders know it.
"I think there is considerable political calculation," said Margaret Montoya, a University of New Mexico law professor and scholar of critical race theory. "It seems that the Democrats require people to move up the ladder through the party ranks. So we see [New Mexico Gov.] Bill Richardson do that. I think that's been true for Latino Democrats in California. But that hasn't been true for Susana Martinez, who goes from being D.A. to being a credible gubernatorial candidate."
Martinez happens to be a party switcher; she was a registered Democrat just before her first run for office in 1996. But what's more significant is this Latina's triumph in a crowded Republican primary for a major office, a virtually unheard-of feat up until now.
Even if Republicans are practicing irony-coated affirmative action, the rise of candidates like Maldonado, Sandoval and Martinez is no doubt giving their Anglo Democratic opponents fits.
But does this year's warm embrace of Republican primary voters and high-profile Latino Republican candidates signal social progress beyond the short-term politics? Montoya says no.
"I'm really slow to reach that conclusion because I would never conclude that having Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court has been an achievement for the African American community," she said by way of analogy.
Yet this year's match-ups in influential states such as California, Nevada and New Mexico hold the potential for molding a newly competitive two-party contest for Latino votes in way that has never really taken shape in the African American community.
Of course, many Cuban American Republicans have found electoral success in Florida over the years. But in the Southwest, where Mexican Americans dominate Latino politics, Latino voters have never been wooed by the GOP quite like today.
Arizona may temporarily be moving in the opposite direction with the state's recently passed immigration law and its anti-immigrant political fallout for the Republican Party, but the basic political calculus remains.
"Republicans feel they have to go way to the right on immigration to win the primaries. [But] if they want to get elected, they'll need the Hispanic vote," Lionel Sosa, a prominent Republican media strategist, recently told the Wall Street Journal.
Beyond a more moderate approach on immigration policy, Lujan, the New Mexico Republican stalwart, suggests that having more Latino GOP standard-bearers is clearly good for the party.
"If you have a wide representation of people, you will attract more voters," he said.
Republicans are testing that theory like never before this year, and the results may prove to be nothing short of revolutionary for the nation's fastest-growing swing vote. It almost seems secondary that the revolution may come in the form of squeezed social spending and skewed tax cuts for mostly wealthy non-Latinos.

Full text: Correction: Wednesday, June 30, 2010: Fiorina campaign: In an article in Sunday's California section about U.S. Senate Republican nominee Carly Fiorina, Riverside County Dist. Atty. Rod Pacheco was mistakenly identified as the chairman of Fiorina's Latino outreach efforts. The chairman of those efforts is former Assemblyman Bob Pacheco (R-Walnut). Sunday, July 04, 2010: Fiorina campaign: An article in the June 26 California section about U.S. Senate Republican nominee Carly Fiorina said that Riverside County Dist. Atty. Rod Pacheco was the chairman of Fiorina's Latino outreach efforts. The chairman of those efforts is former Assemblyman Bob Pacheco (R-Walnut).
Reaching out to a key voting bloc, Republican Senate nominee Carly Fiorina held a Latino-themed town hall Saturday afternoon in Sacramento, heaping praise on California's Latino community for representing "the best of who this nation is."
"Bienvenidos," Fiorina beamed to the crowd of less than 20, which was nearly matched in size by her staff in a downtown Mexican eatery.
The event, paired with Fiorina's launch of a new Spanish-language website, Amigos de Carly, is part of an ethnic outreach tour for the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive in her bid to unseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer. Last weekend, Fiorina took a spin through a predominantly African American Juneteenth festival in South Los Angeles. The moves represent a sharp shift in rhetorical emphasis, though not policy positions, after a GOP primary in which Fiorina hewed to the right.
Her stump speech with anecdotes recounting her ascent from secretary to CEO -- "the American dream," as she put it -- on Saturday was laced with new references. "The Latino community is a foundation for the American dream going forward," she said.
Fiorina's direct appeal to Latinos follows in the footsteps of her GOP counterpart in the governor's race, former EBay chief Meg Whitman, who began advertising on Spanish-language TV stations during the World Cup. Most political analysts believe that any statewide Republican must garner a substantial chunk, perhaps one-third, of the Latino vote to win in November.
"The Latino community is big, and therefore it's important," Fiorina said.
But Fiorina faces one barrier Whitman does not: her support for the new anti-illegal immigrant law in Arizona. She made no mention of it during the town hall, but told reporters afterward, "I do support the law, and I think it was a tragedy the law was necessary."
Riverside County Dist. Atty. Rod Pacheco, chairman of Fiorina's Latino-outreach efforts who attended the town hall, seemed to acknowledge that the Arizona law could be an albatross. But, he said, "it's better to be firm on your position, know where you stand, than be wishy-washy."
Boxer called the law "divisive" in Los Angeles on Friday. "In the Latino community there is tremendous opposition to it," she said.
State Sen. Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles), a leading Latino legislator, said the GOP overtures to Latino voters demonstrated their power. "What a dramatic change from the time period of Proposition 187, when you could simply openly attack the Latino community and there wouldn't be a political consequence to that," he said, referring to the 1994 initiative that sought to cut public services to illegal immigrants.
Cedillo, a liberal, said Latinos tend to be socially conservative and distrustful of government and, therefore, are "poised to be Republicans." But with Republicans' anti-immigrant rhetoric in the recent primary, he said, they "may have dug themselves in a hole that's too difficult to dig out of."
One issue Fiorina is seeking to exploit among Latinos is the fallout from environmental restrictions. Water deliveries have been severely cut to Central Valley farmlands by the federal Endangered Species Act, which protects the Delta smelt, a small fish. Fiorina wants to carve out an exemption to the landmark environmental law to increase the water flow; Boxer does not.
"Tens of thousands of Latinos lost their jobs," Fiorina said of the effect of the water cutbacks, one of several times she mentioned the issue. "Fish are not more important than families."
She pledged that working to overturn the limits would be the "first thing I will do," if elected.

Abstract: In 2007, "Persepolis," the French animated film based on Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel about her Iranian childhood, was released to deserved acclaim. Since June 12, 2009, and the protests that followed the likely rigged reelection of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iranian visibility has risen dramatically.

Full text: If pop culture is a measure of cultural visibility, then Iranian Americans have been invisible for decades. Of course, there was Iran itself, hardly invisible. But as a teenager, I knew my reality, one far from hostage crises and contra trials, was never going to make it pop culturally; in fact, I would have bet my little hyphenated life against the very moment of pop cultural breakthrough we're finally reaching now.
Back then, every time a bit of Iran broke through, it was an event. In 1991, when I was 13, "Not Without My Daughter" came out -- the true story of American Betty Mahmoody (played by Sally Field), who was essentially kidnapped by her abusive Iranian husband while on a visit to Iran. I still remember my family's naive moment of rejoicing at the trailer -- Gidget had married an Iranian! But after 45 seconds the voiceover's tune changed: "He swore they would be safe. They would be happy. They would be free to leave. He lied." Apparently Gidget's "crime of being an American" was being met with the horrific punishment of living in Iran forever! On the screen were suddenly bombs, women in veils screaming. It was a horror movie about Iran. We were Freddy Krueger. I went to school the next day filled with shame, as if everyone would be thinking I was a Gidget killer.
The next time I caught mention of Iran in any cinematic sense was four years later, when "Clueless" came out, about a spoiled 90210 Valley Girl, Cher. I still remember doing a mental happy dance when Cher, pointing to a cloud of Cartier, Armani and Aqua Net, declared, "And that's the Persian mafia. You can't hang with them unless you have a BMW."
By then I knew Beverly Hills High was filled with "Tehrangelenos" -- denizens of Westwood and Beverly Hills colonized by Iranian culture -- but to have Hollywood say this, well, take that, Gidget! Iran had gone from the land of bombs and veils to Iranian-America, a haven of big hair, bling, allah-who-alla-wha-ing, material girls and boys.
In the mid- to late '90s -- the closest Iran-U.S. relations came to a golden age since the '70s-- there were few other popular movie references, but the big-city indie set was hot on Iranian cinema: Abbas Kiarostami, Majid Majidi, Jafar Panahi and Mohsen Makhmalbaf. Much of the novelty of the '90s Iranian arthouse -- quick to become a Cannes critics' darling -- was a cinema of restriction, what happens when a government won't allow its greatest minds to visit, say, the simplest expressions of female sexuality. My father made them mandatory viewing and I'd often fall asleep in the theater, immune to anything that didn't involve MTV editing or Terminators. Plus, none of the kids at school knew about these bleak yet beautiful knockouts. The tree was falling in the woods, but only Iranians -- and the film critics who love them -- heard the sound.
You can't ignore a diaspora for long, though. The "temporary" immigrant population, a notion primarily perpetuated by Iranians loathe to abandon "exile" status, was becoming less temporary. Wasn't the L.A. climate pretty much the same as Tehran anyway? Wasn't the Persian rosewater and saffron ice cream at Hollywood's Mashti Malone's just as good or better than the bastani akbar-mashti on Tajrish Square?
Iranians, left outside of the 9/11 conversation, began to leak fairly seamlessly into the best and worst of pop culture. In 2003, veteran Iranian actress Shohreh Aghadashloo starred in "The House of Sand and Fog," for which she became the first Iranian nominated for an Academy Award (although two years later she played a member of a terrorist family on the hit TV show "24"). In 2005, the best picture winner, "Crash," featured Persian characters and Persian dialogue. Two years later, MTV's "The Real World: Sydney" included a whiny Iranian American cast member, and even "90210" cast an Iranian.
Worst moment yet: 2006 film "300" outraged Iranians for its depiction of demonic Persian warriors. Best moment yet: In 2007, "Persepolis," the French animated film based on Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel about her Iranian childhood, was released to deserved acclaim.
Since June 12, 2009, and the protests that followed the likely rigged reelection of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iranian visibility has risen dramatically. Who could forget the brief moment when icons across the Twitterverse went green, when even actress Alyssa Milano could tweet about nothing else? And of course, the revolution got a face that launched thousands of clicks in Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year-old student whose fatal shooting at the protests circulated worldwide via the Internet. The world was seeing, was listening, for once.
So maybe it's no surprise that pop culture has thrown Iranian Americans some big bones recently: last fall, NBC added fairly-unknown comic Nasim Pedrad to the "SNL" cast. ABC announced a pilot for Iranian American humorist Firoozeh Dumas' "Big Fat Greek Wedding" of Iranian American memoirs, "Funny in Farsi" with Iranian-American funnyman Maz Jobrani as the lead (though ABC did not pick it up in the end). The $200-million movie "Prince of Persia" was released in May. And this spring, the creators of "Jersey Shore" sent out a casting call for a show they are tentatively calling "The Persian Version," a "Jersey Shore"-of-the-Tehrangeles set.
Now that we're starting to be seen as a permanent part of this country's fabric, we have to ask: Is this the manifestation of that hyphen that we long sought? Does it all amount to a Persian Snooki?
In a recent, heavily circulated video promoting official Iranian minority status on the occasion of the 2010 census, Jobrani -- whose IMDB page reflects roles on prominent TV shows ("The West Wing," "Curb Your Enthusiasm") but also reveals some unfortunate typecasting ("Sikh," "robber," "imam") -- parodies several Iranian types, who, like many of us who at some point or another wanted to co-opt a less controversial ethnicity, insist they're "Italian." The video's point is to get Iranians here to put "Iranian American" in the "other" category, but it cleverly spotlights a turning point for Iranian acceptance in the proverbial melting pot.
It's a pot that would scare any self-respecting minority from dipping a toe into, of course.
Perhaps Kiarostami's acclaimed Cannes entry last month is the best indicator of how to proceed. "Certified Copy" is the director's first totally non-Iranian film -- Frenchwoman (Juliette Binoche) and Brit (William Shimell) star in a movie set in Italy -- catapulting him from a nativist artist to an international director. It's bound to create less critical praise than his more allegorical idyllic-Iran impoverished-children-tearjerkers. But it's an occasion for Iranians abroad to celebrate. When we can bust out of the ol' pigeonhole -- as when Pedrad gets to play Kathy Griffin or Mary-Kate Olsen instead of Ahmadinejad's wife on "SNL" -- then we will be a real American minority.
Just as most self-respecting Italian Americans don't want anything to do with the image of Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, we should be the first to dismiss the Persian Snooki-Princess when she arrives. And we should remind ourselves that "Prince of Persia" and that awful Oriental arabesque font used on almost every book cover by a female Iranian memoirist -- aren't about us.
After all, a certain type of invisibility, if considered like that superhero power that kids covet, is a virtue. It's up to us to be individuals, to resist what comes after easily fitting into a census category. Being able to say there is no us sounds like freedom to me.

Abstract: The 1984 version of "The Karate Kid" owes its iconic status, in large part, to its timeless themes of teenage anxiety, courage and moral redemption -- not to anything it might tell us about the United States' role in the world. Japan -- diminished on the world stage by a lost decade of economic stagnation, an aging and contracting population, a once-mighty yen facing marginalization -- has disappeared from the story.

Full text: A movie that gets fans to stand on one leg and flap their arms would hardly seem like a platform for a lesson in geopolitics. The 1984 version of "The Karate Kid" owes its iconic status, in large part, to its timeless themes of teenage anxiety, courage and moral redemption -- not to anything it might tell us about the United States' role in the world.
But when paired with its summer 2010 remake, the two movies offer a parable on the transformation of the global economy, the end of the American century and the changing balance of power between the United States and Asia. Between Jackie Chan's sly digs about global warming and Jaden Smith's status as a refugee of the U.S. economy, you can almost feel the world's center of gravity shifting.
Rewind the Betamax to 1984 and you'll recall that, back then, California was still the promised land, the place where the film's teenage protagonist, Daniel LaRusso, and his mom had moved from New Jersey to start a new life. It was also the place to which the family of Daniel's Japanese mentor, Mr. Miyagi, had immigrated years before.
The original movie's America was a land of exterior allure and interior motion, a place that allowed an old Japanese karate master and an Italian American kid from Jersey to form a life-altering friendship. It was the melting pot at its most potent.
It was also an America halfway through the Reagan years, a superpower at the height of its Cold War influence but still coming to terms with its own strength, still grappling with the proper uses of force. Between oil shocks and inflation, the 1970s and early 1980s had not been great for the economy. But if the United States worried about imports, trade deficits and currencies, it was Japan that provoked concern.
Interwoven with crane kicks and Cobra Kais, the movie offered some subtle moralizing on U.S. conflicts of the past half-century: Miyagi was not just any Japanese immigrant, but a World War II hero who had fought against his native land on America's behalf and whose wife and son had died in childbirth in a U.S. internment camp. Meanwhile, the bullies who antagonized Daniel were trained by a Vietnam veteran whose merciless approach to martial arts contrasted with Miyagi's karate-as-life-lesson approach. A corny device, but also laden with overtones of "Vietnam bad, World War II good."
In hindsight, this was not just a coming-of-age flick, but a uniquely American film that adroitly captured national dynamics, circa 1984.
Jump to the new version. Japan -- diminished on the world stage by a lost decade of economic stagnation, an aging and contracting population, a once-mighty yen facing marginalization -- has disappeared from the story.
U.S. interests in Asia now revolve around China, and the movie has been set in Beijing in what amounts to a two-hour-plus advertisement for the country, featuring stunning landscapes, smog-free skies and a Forbidden City void of police. (Perhaps the $5 million in funding from the Chinese government, together with permission to film in the country, helped shape the outcome? That's a question for Jaden's dad, Will Smith, one of the producers.)
Key plot dynamics are reversed. America is no longer the land of opportunity. The boy protagonist, Dre Parker, has left the economic mayhem of urban Detroit. He and his mother have been transferred by an unnamed car company from a failing factory in Michigan to a presumably thriving one in China. No more escaping to the surfer 'burbs of California. Presumably no jobs are there, either.
Instead it is all the way to an apartment complex in downtown Beijing. As Dre's mom announces, China is now home. This is no temporary ex-pat gig, it appears, but a full-blown inversion of the immigration patterns that defined the modern global economy.
It's an improbable reversal that speaks directly to the American anxieties of 2010. If the United States is no longer a beacon for ambitious immigrants -- and indeed is exporting bright young families -- maybe it is in decline.
China, it would seem from the movie's perspective, is clearly the future. Dre, thumbing through a dated book about the country, expects to find nothing but old Fu Manchu characters and crumbling buildings. Instead he is awed by the sparkling Olympic village, the cute young women, the parks buzzing with activity -- tai chi, soccer, basketball, music. It seems like everybody in China has an outdoor hobby.
As in the original, the boy is beset by bullies, and there's still a malevolent martial arts teacher. Various bits of dialogue and key scenes are retained from the original, and the remake is still a fun ride on a young-meets-old, East-meets-West and good-beats-bad level.
But it tells a different story.
Any about subtext are dispelled by Mr. Han, the Mr. Miyagi successor played by Hong Kong-born martial arts crossover star Jackie Chan. Han turns out to be not just the building handyman, but a full-fledged kung fu master. (This remake might be better titled "The Kung Fu Kid," because karate, more associated with Japan, has been replaced by the Chinese martial arts discipline.)
For all we know, Han might also have been advising the Chinese government at the Copenhagen climate talks last fall. He is, at any rate, a handyman with an environmental conscience.
When the new Americans complain of a broken water heater in their apartment, he explains that they only have to flip the switch and wait half an hour before showering, then turn the heater off.
There's a switch? They seem puzzled. In the United States, hot water is always just there.
Put in a switch, Han lectures, and save the planet.
There's a blunter moment as well. Like Miyagi in the original, Han plays briefly at trying to catch a fly with a pair of chopsticks -- but then abruptly pulls out a flyswatter and smashes the insect.
There's little doubt where the flyswatter was made, but by the end of the movie one might wonder: Was that a joke or a warning?

Full text: This week's confrontation between a senior Army general and the president of the United States may have signaled the beginning of the end of the war in Afghanistan. In a year or two, President Obama will be able to say that he gave the conflict his best shot, reshaping the strategy and even putting his top guy in charge, the general who led the surge in Iraq -- but that things still didn't work out.
Then he can begin pulling out.
This is not a vote of no-confidence in Gen. David H. Petraeus, whom the president has selected to lead the U.S. effort in Afghanistan, replacing the disgraced Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal. It is a simple recognition that the conditions Petraeus enjoyed in Iraq are far from present in Afghanistan, and that the key skills he brought to bear in the first war won't help him as much in the second.
What allowed Petraeus to succeed in Iraq was not the troop surge itself; after all, a city as big and sprawling as Baghdad, with 5 million people living in two- and three-story homes, can swallow 30,000 troops without a burp. Nor was it his development of a counterinsurgency doctrine for the Army. The key tenets -- such as focusing on protecting the population, while still going after the diehard insurgents, and splitting rather than uniting the enemy -- were familiar stuff to anyone who had read the relevant books. It seemed novel only in the context of Iraq, where for many years the American commanders had terrified families by knocking down doors in the middle of the night, treating locals not as the prize to be won but as the playing field on which they confronted the insurgents.
Rather, Petraeus's critical contribution in Iraq was one of leadership: He got everyone on the same page. Until he arrived, there often seemed to be dozens of wars going on, with every brigade commander trying to figure out the strategic goals of a campaign. Before Petraeus arrived, the top priority for U.S. forces was getting out. After he took over, the No. 1 task for U.S. troops, explicitly listed in the mission statement he issued, was to protect the Iraqi people.
Of course, establishing cohesion in the U.S. effort in Iraq took a lot more than issuing statements. In spring 2007, I watched Petraeus work hard to establish a consensus about what the goals should be and how to achieve them. "There are three enormous tasks that strategic leaders have to get right," he told me one day in Baghdad. "The first is to get the big ideas right. The second is to communicate the big ideas throughout the organization. The third is proper execution of the big ideas." An astute bureaucratic operator, he used a variety of studies and panels convened in his Baghdad headquarters to pull together the big ideas of how to deal with the insurgency and how to better protect the Iraqi people. These had the useful side effect of getting buy-in from civilian American officials in Iraq.
Just as important, he worked tirelessly with his military subordinates, going out and talking not just to the division commanders below him, but to their brigade commanders and even to the battalion commanders an echelon below them. He issued letters to the troops explaining the new approach of living among the people and protecting them with small, vulnerable outposts. He walked the streets and talked to Iraqis. He also hired a leading counterinsurgency expert, David Kilcullen, an Australian infantry officer turned anthropologist, to coach American commanders, making sure that they not only talked counterinsurgency but that they also learned how to practice it. In a series of interviews I conducted with Petraeus in 2007 and 2008, one of his favorite words was "relentless." It is the best one-word summary of his approach.
Finally, Petraeus took a much more humble stance, in which Iraqis were not told what to do and how and when to do it, but were asked their advice about what to do, and the best way to do it. It was notable that three of the most important advisers around Petraeus as he took command were foreigners -- Kilcullen; a pacifistic British political adviser named Emma Sky who had been against the war; and Sadi Othman, a Palestinian American who became Petraeus's personal envoy to the Iraqi government. A sharp contrast to the frat-boy atmosphere around McChrystal depicted in a Rolling Stone profile that led to his dismissal.
Petraeus was aided enormously by Ryan C. Crocker, one of the savviest American diplomats and one of the most experienced in the region, having served in Pakistan, Lebanon and in Iraq decades prior. Early in the war, friction between Ambassador L. Paul Bremer and Army Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez had crippled the U.S. effort and confused Iraqis. Bremer was all about transforming Iraq politically, an inherently turbulent mission, while the U.S. Army decided on its own that its job was to produce stability.
Repelled by such persistent friction, Petraeus and Crocker were determined to coordinate their actions. Word went out to subordinates that neither of them would tolerate infighting between civilian and military officials. When the two returned to the United States to testify before Congress in September 2007, they showed a united front, key in winning them more time for the war at a moment when congressional leaders such as Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. were saying it was time to "stop the surge and start bringing our troops home."
In Kabul, alas, Petraeus will find no such useful ally in the American ambassador. Instead, the top U.S. diplomat there is Karl W. Eikenberry, who relentlessly opposed McChrystal's initiatives. Unlike Crocker, Eikenberry has no strong base in the State Department and is not steeped in the history and culture of the region. Rather, he is a retired general who in fighting with McChrystal over the past year used many of the same arguments that another American commander, John Abizaid, had used in opposing Petraeus's approach to Iraq. That is no coincidence -- Abizaid and Eikenberry have been close friends since they were West Point roommates in the class of 1973.
On top of that, Petraeus will have to deal with Richard C. Holbrooke, who seems to have achieved little as a special presidential envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. And the general will face a host government even more troublesome than what he dealt with in Baghdad. Indeed, the two biggest problems the United States faces in Afghanistan are the Karzai government and the Pakistani government -- and neither of those really can be addressed by military operations.
McChrystal was dismissed because of the magazine article that laid before the world the sniping and backbiting between U.S. military and civilian officials in the Afghan war. That is not going to end just because Petraeus goes to Kabul, or even because the president has said he doesn't like it. It might end only when one person is put in charge of the overall American presence in Afghanistan, with the power to hire and fire. Obama has not taken that step, so it is likely that the same nettlesome quarrels that exasperated McChrystal also will fatigue his successor.
For the second time in three years, Petraeus has come to the rescue of a president beleaguered by a faraway war. President George W. Bush came to rely enormously on Petraeus in 2007, when the general's credibility on Iraq far exceeded that of the White House. It will be interesting to witness how the relationship between the new president and his new general evolves. Petraeus is much more like Obama than he was like Bush. The Dutch American general and the African American commander in chief are oddly similar. Both are the sons of immigrant fathers; both are intelligent and ambitious; both are more cool, cerebral and distant than most of their peers.
But in Bush, Petraeus had a president willing to take huge risks, such as putting Iraq's Sunni insurgency on the American payroll and taking far heavier casualties as U.S. troops moved off big bases. Obama has not shown a willingness to gamble that much in Afghanistan. Perhaps not even Petraeus could talk this president into rolling the dice.
Thomas E. Ricks, a former Washington Post reporter, is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and the author of two books about the Iraq war, most recently "The Gamble: General David Petraeus and the American Military Adventure in Iraq, 2006-2008."

Abstract: Early one morning in March, two Chicago-area brothers were dozing on an Amtrak train when it stopped in Buffalo, N.Y. A pair of uniformed Border Patrol agents made their way through the car, asking passengers if they were U.S. citizens. Even though the president supports the Dream Act -- which would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought here as children who enroll in college or the military -- his enforcement bureaucracy continues to pursue deportation cases against the increasing number of students who would be protected by it.

Full text: Early one morning in March, two Chicago-area brothers were dozing on an Amtrak train when it stopped in Buffalo, N.Y. A pair of uniformed Border Patrol agents made their way through the car, asking passengers if they were U.S. citizens. No, the vacationing siblings answered honestly, with flat, Midwestern inflections: We're citizens of Mexico.
And so it was that college students Carlos Robles, 20, and his brother Rafael, 19 -- both former captains of their high school varsity tennis team -- found themselves in jail, facing deportation.
Their secret was out: Despite their upbringing in middle America, their academic success and their network of native-born friends, they had no permission to be in the United States. Their parents had brought them here illegally as children.
The Robles brothers, now out of jail but fighting removal in Immigration Court, are among thousands of young illegal immigrants in similar situations, living at risk of being expelled to countries they barely remember.
Two weeks ago, a Harvard University student who came from Mexico at age 4, Eric Balderas, joined their ranks after he was arrested by immigration agents at an airport in San Antonio.
These immigrants are known in some circles as "Dream Act" kids, named after proposed legislation that would grant them legal status.
Their cases underscore a contradiction in the Obama administration's approach to immigration enforcement. Even though the president supports the Dream Act -- which would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought here as children who enroll in college or the military -- his enforcement bureaucracy continues to pursue deportation cases against the increasing number of students who would be protected by it. It's part of a push that is on track to remove a record 400,000 illegal immigrants this year.
"It highlights the inconsistencies in immigration policies," said William Perez, a Claremont Graduate University professor and author of "We Are Americans," a book about undocumented immigrant students.
Immigration authorities say they rarely deport students, particularly once their teachers, coaches, friends and elected representatives speak out on their behalf.
Balderas, for example, was placed in "deferred status," meaning the government won't remove him unless he gets in trouble. Even so, the young people remain in legal limbo, often unable to land a professional job after earning a degree. And they live with a legal sword of Damocles over their heads, subject to removal at any moment.
"These cases illustrate the need for comprehensive immigration reform," said Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "ICE uses its discretion on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate."
Carlos and Rafael Robles were on their way to visit a friend at Harvard -- not Balderas -- when they were arrested. They spent a weekend in jail before friends posted $5,000 bond for each of them. They had to travel to Buffalo again recently for a court hearing after an immigration judge turned down their request to move the case to Chicago. Their next court date is next year.
Their father works for a car dealer, and their mother is an assistant at a mortgage company. They came to the U.S. by airplane five years ago on a tourist visa and never went back.
"We want to go to school and to work here," Carlos Robles said.
Several residents of their community, a Republican-leaning Chicago suburb where most people have little patience for illegal immigration, have written letters on their behalf, said Robert Carroll, a teacher at Palatine High School.
"Gee whiz, these are just two quality kids," he said. "They are everything you would want your kids to be. These kids are going to be leaders in their communities -- taxpayers, not tax recipients."
In recent months, immigration rights activists have renewed their push to persuade Congress to pass the Dream Act. Activists have staged hunger strikes and occupied congressional offices. This month, about 30 students marched outside the Los Angeles office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). Feinstein is a co-sponsor of the Dream Act, but activists have criticized Democrats for not moving the bill this year.
"Immigration reform may be dead this year, but we feel that smaller pieces like ... the Dream Act can move forward," said Marisol Ramos, founding board member of the national United We Dream network. "Democrats should really step up."
The Dream Act, sponsored by Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and others, came up eight votes short in the Senate in 2007, when an effort to overhaul immigration law fell apart. The following year, then-candidate Barack Obama urged its passage during a presidential debate, saying that youths who "have essentially grown up as Americans" deserve legal status. But Obama has done little to push the bill as president.
After meetings with immigration rights groups this month, Senate leaders were hopeful they could move a Dream Act bill this year, a senior Senate aide said.
But proponents have to overcome opposition from those who say the measure would grant amnesty to a far larger circle of illegal immigrants than the college students who have become the faces of the movement.
Under the proposed legislation, when the youths become citizens and turn 21, they could sponsor their parents for green cards.
"It would lead to chain migration," said Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, which supports stricter controls on immigration. "And they would create a lot of extra competition for our own students."
There are dozens of undocumented students attending Ivy League and other selective universities and hundreds at state schools, he said. They often speak flawless English and have few memories of their native counties. Many were not aware they were illegal until they began applying to college.
"I grew up thinking I was just like everybody else," said Jessica Lopez, 19, who just finished her first year at Cal Poly Pomona. "That is when it hit me, 'I am undocumented.' "
Lopez is trying to avoid deportation to Mexico -- a country she hasn't seen since she was 7. Her family came to the attention of authorities after her father's employer initiated, then withdrew, petitions to secure green cards for the family, she said.
Lopez graduated near the top of her high school class in Pomona, then was accepted to UC Berkeley, UCLA and Bates College in Maine. She decided on Cal Poly Pomona because it was less expensive -- and as an illegal immigrant, she couldn't qualify for federal aid.
Lopez, who is studying to become a chemical engineer, is gathering letters of support from her professors, coaches and counselors to present at the next Immigration Court hearing. At the same time, Lopez said, she is praying that the Dream Act passes.
"We are all just crossing our fingers," she said. "It will benefit so many of us. It's not just me."

Full text: Elian Gonzalez, a Cuban shipwreck survivor who became the center of an international custody battle, is studying to become a military officer, the official media said Sunday as it marked a decade since his return to the Caribbean island.
"A decade after being used as a toy by the enemies of the revolution, we see him wearing an olive-green uniform as a student of the Camilo Cienfuegos military school, where he is preparing to be a future officer of the Revolutionary Armed Forces," the communist youth newspaper, Jeventud Rebelde, reported.
The Cuban military operates high-school level academies across the country.
"The boy of yesterday (today 16) is now an ordinary Cuban," the page-long article in Sunday's only newspaper said. It mentioned that he had recently attended a communist youth congress where he "shared motivations, ideas and invited us to traverse the paths of the future."
The Cuban government has shielded Gonzalez from international journalists, and he rarely appears in state-run media reports.
Gonzalez was 5 years old when he was found floating on an inner tube off the Florida coast in November 1999.
He had survived a shipwreck that killed his mother and other Cubans who had left the communist island for the United States, but quickly became caught up in the political riptide of Havana-Washington politics.
In the United States, Gonzalez was at the center of a clash between Cuba's government and anti-Castro exiles in Miami, his image a fixture on TV screens around the world.
Then-President Fidel Castro launched an international campaign for the return of the boy to his father and grandparents in Cuba, staging rallies and marches across the country.
Cuban exiles camped out for months in front of the home where the boy was staying.
They lost a passionate legal battle to let Gonzalez remain in Miami with his great-uncle's family, who refused to give him up. In April 2000, federal immigration agents finally seized Gonzalez from the home at gunpoint and reunited him with his father, who took him back to Cuba on June 28.
It was Castro's last major international campaign and political victory before undergoing surgery in 2006, passing power to his brother, Raul Castro in 2008.

LONDON--The U.K. government began a consultation with the business community over plans to impose an immigration cap on workers coming into the country, an idea that faces opposition from industry interests who say it will restrict the recruitment of key talent.
The debate underscores the difficulty Britain's new government faces in balancing public concern about immigration and a need to revive the economy.
The cap, which applies only to skilled and highly skilled workers coming to the U.K. from outside Europe, is due to take effect in April. The government said Monday that it is also imposing temporary limits, effective immediately, to avoid a rush on applications ahead of the permanent new rules.
David Cameron, who became prime minister last month, made immigration a key part of his election platform. His Conservative Party argued high immigration levels have put pressure on public services and led to tensions in communities.
Workers coming to the U.K. from outside Europe account for less than 15% of all foreigners who arrive in the U.K. each year. The cap wouldn't apply to other large groups coming to the U.K., notably students and people from Europe.
Labour Party politicians and other opponents have called immigration caps arbitrary and unworkable, saying they would hinder Britain's economic recovery, among other things. They also say that the economy has benefited from the inflow of migrant workers to the U.K. over recent years.
The Liberal Democrats, with whom the Conservatives were forced to form a coalition government following inconclusive election results, had opposed an immigration cap during the election campaign. A party spokeswoman said the coalition effort involved compromises and that both parties were "united in seeking to meet the immense challenges that face the country."
Nicolas Rollason, a London-based partner at law firm Kingsley Napley LLP whose clients include multinational firms in finance and other industries, says employers are concerned about not being able to respond quickly enough when the economy turns around. "It will have a significant impact on businesses' ability to recruit--and plan recruitment--because you never know when it will run out," he said.
Among industries likely to be most affected are technology, finance and engineering, which rely heavily on overseas recruitment.
"It's a very, very crude tool," said Philip Trott, at the U.K.'s Bates Wells & Braithwaite LLP, in part because it doesn't take account of which industries are most in need of skills.
Mr. Trott points to experiences in the U.S., where caps on skilled worker visas typically have been heavily oversubscribed. U.S. high-tech companies have long been critical of the limits, arguing that they hinder employers' ability to secure qualified workers and that the U.S. risks losing its competitive edge in technology as a result.
"I recognize the importance of attracting the brightest and the best to ensure strong economic growth, but unlimited migration places unacceptable pressure on public services," said Home Secretary Theresa May in a statement Monday.
The number of immigrants coming to the U.K. surged over the past decade under a Labour government, particularly following the European Union's 2004 enlargement, which opened the way for workers from Eastern Europe to freely move to Britain.
Net migration--the number of people who come to live in the U.K. minus those that move overseas--spiked to more than 200,000 annually in some years from less than 50,000 in 1997.
Those numbers have declined in recent years, falling by almost a third to 163,000 in 2008, the latest statistics available. Labour politicians credit tougher border controls, though immigration specialists say the economic downturn played a significant role because there have been fewer jobs to attract people from overseas.
Conservative politicians have said they would like to see net immigration levels in the "tens of thousands."

Abstract: Republican members of the committee expressed doubts Monday whether Kagan, who was a White House official during the Clinton administration, could set aside her political views and approach cases objectively. Several Republicans mentioned an article Kagan wrote while a law professor in 1995, in which she labeled Supreme Court confirmation hearings a "vapid and hollow charade," and they encouraged her to be frank about her political views.

Full text: Seeking to blunt an impending Republican attack on her fitness for the Supreme Court, Elena Kagan said Monday that if confirmed, she would consider every case "impartially, modestly, with commitment to principle and in accordance to the law."
Kagan, tapped for the high court by President Obama in May, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on the first day of her confirmation hearing that as a justice she would listen to arguments from all sides "across every apparent political or ideological divide."
"No one has a monopoly on truth or wisdom," Kagan said.
Republican members of the committee expressed doubts Monday whether Kagan, who was a White House official during the Clinton administration, could set aside her political views and approach cases objectively.
"We don't have any substantive evidence to demonstrate your ability to transition from a legal scholar and political operative to a fair and impartial jurist," Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) told her.
Beyond that, Republicans made it clear they would grill her on a series of issues, including gun rights, illegal immigration, same-sex marriage and campaign finance regulation.
They also voiced concern that she has never served as a judge.
"Ms. Kagan has less real legal experience of any nominee in at least 50 years," said Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the committee's top Republican. "It's not just that she has never been a judge. She has barely practiced law, and not with the intensity and duration from which real understanding occurs."
Democrats, conversely, praised her as a highly qualified candidate who would be able to distinguish between the role of policymaker and judge.
"There is no basis to question her integrity, and no one should presume that this intelligent woman, who has excelled during every part of her varied and distinguished career, lacks independence," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the committee chairman.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called Kagan's lack of judicial experience "refreshing," but Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.) said Kagan's judicial philosophy "is almost invisible to us."
Kagan, 50, has served for the last year as the government's lawyer before the high court. Prior to her work in the Clinton White House, she was a dean of Harvard Law School and spent the majority of her career in academia.
She's the youngest nominee to come before the committee since Clarence Thomas, who was 43, in 1991.
Of the Republicans, most eyes remained on Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who bucked his party last year and supported then-nominee Sonia Sotomayor.
On Monday, Graham was both complimentary of Kagan and skeptical. He defended her work as U.S. solicitor general, particularly in cases involving anti-terrorism policy, but said he was troubled by her efforts as Harvard Law School dean to deny military recruiters access to campus because of the Pentagon's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
Several Republicans mentioned an article Kagan wrote while a law professor in 1995, in which she labeled Supreme Court confirmation hearings a "vapid and hollow charade," and they encouraged her to be frank about her political views. "It's OK to disagree with us," Graham told her.
Kagan and the administration aides who have been advising her may have another view. She's expected to testify before the committee over the next two days and perhaps into Thursday, and is likely to avoid straying into controversial territory as much as possible.
Prior to her opening statement, Kagan was introduced by Massachusetts Sens. John F. Kerry, a Democrat, and Scott Brown, a Republican -- perhaps a politically savvy move. Brown's support could be instrumental in ensuring the GOP cannot filibuster Kagan's nomination.
Still, with Democrats holding 58 seats in the Senate, a clear path to the court seems almost assured, as one senator noted Monday.
"I don't want to take any suspense out of these proceedings," said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), "but things are looking good for your confirmation."

A huge word made small; 'Holocaust' is being demeaned in political and rhetoric and casual comparisons.

Full text: Correction: Saturday, July 03, 2010: Language: In a June 29 Op-Ed article about the misuse of the word "holocaust," Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Hoess' surname was misspelled as Hess.
Over the last few years, U.S. political discourse has been saturated with opponents accusing each other of Nazi-like policies or behavior. Most recently, it was California Atty. Gen. Jerry Brown who likened the attack ads of Meg Whitman, his Republican opponent in the race for governor, to the tactics employed by Nazi propaganda chief Josef Goebbels.
Brown later called me to say he regretted citing Goebbels. But most of the comparisons are made without apology.
Last week, Sarah Palin criticized President Obama's handling of the BP crisis in a tweet to followers recommending they read an article by Thomas Sowell that compared Adolph Hitler's use of a financial crisis to give himself dictatorial powers to Obama's role in creating the BP escrow fund. A few months ago, speaking about the controversial Arizona immigration bill (a bill that the Wiesenthal Center criticized), Lillian Rodriguez Lopez of the Hispanic Federation reportedly compared the measure to tactics used by the Nazis in Germany.
The Holocaust was a watershed event in the history of mankind, in which 6 million Jews -- one-third of the world's Jewish population -- were exterminated. But today the word is used in ways that diminish its singularity.
Last fall, Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson of Florida spoke on the House floor about the need for universal healthcare, saying Americans die every year because they lack insurance. "I apologize to the dead and their families," he said, "that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America."
In 2007, former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee used the word in speaking out against abortion. "For the last 35 years we have aborted more than 1 million people who would have otherwise been in our workforce," he said, "had we not had the holocaust of liberalized abortions under a flawed Supreme Court ruling in 1973."
And syndicated columnist David Sirota recently applied the term to the BP gulf oil disaster, saying, "Every American who uses oil -- which is to say, every American -- is incriminated in this ecological holocaust."
The continued misuse and trivialization of the word prompted Elie Wiesel, Nobel laureate and chronicler of the Holocaust, to discontinue using it. "Whatever mishap occurs now, they call it 'holocaust,'" Wiesel said. "I have seen it myself in television in the country in which I live. A commentator describing the defeat of a sports team, somewhere, called it a 'holocaust.'"
Wiesel is right. There are many injustices and manifestations of evil in our world, even in our own country, the greatest of democracies. Standing up to them is not only our right but our obligation. But that obligation does not include distorting and demeaning the word that has come to stand for the great evil that was the Holocaust.
The Holocaust was a total eclipse of humanity. It was not about going to the back of the line or eating in a different part of the restaurant or being escorted to the border without recourse. The Holocaust had one purpose: the total annihilation and extinction of a race.
The Holocaust was the story of ordinary Germans: students, doctors, men and women of culture, who were not demented, who listened to Bach and Beethoven, who loved their families, who were not diagnosed as psychopaths, but who, nonetheless for six years, rounded up men, women and children and escorted them to the gas chambers.
As the commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf Hess, wrote in his confession before he was tried and executed in Poland:
"Up to this point, it was not clear to me, nor to Eichmann, how the killing of the expected masses was to be done -- perhaps by gas, but how and what kind of gas. I was always horrified of death by firing squads, especially when I thought of the large numbers of women and children who would have to be killed. Now I was at ease, we were all saved from these blood baths and the victims would be spared until the last moment.... I also watched how some women, who suspected or knew what was happening, even with the fear of death all over their faces, still managed enough strength to play with their children and talk to them lovingly. Once, a woman with four children, all holding each other by the hand to help the smallest ones, passed by me. She stepped very close to me and whispered, pointing to her four children, 'How can you murder these beautiful, darling children? Don't you have any heart?' "
That was the Holocaust. It is not the BP oil disaster, it is not healthcare, it is not Arizona law, it is not the attack ads of Meg Whitman, it is not abortion, and it is not even horrific violations of civil rights.
The enormity of the crimes of the Holocaust was such that if you were to try to call out 2,000 of the names every day of the 6 million who perished, it would take more than eight years to complete the task. That's what a holocaust is.

Justices extend rights of gun owners; The Supreme Court decision paves the way for challenges to state and local firearm restrictions.

Abstract: Gun ownership rights -- like free-speech rights -- are not absolute, and state and local governments retain the authority to enact reasonable gun-control laws, said Rick Garnett, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who wrote the opinion for the majority, said crime data from the Chicago Police Department "reveal that the city's handgun murder rate has actually increased since the ban was enacted and that Chicago residents now face one of the highest murder rates in the country."

In a 5-4 decision, the justices said the right to have a handgun for self-defense is "fundamental from an American perspective [and] applies equally to the federal government and the states."
The high court overturned 19th century rulings that said the 2nd Amendment restricted only federal gun laws, not local or state measures.
The decision will almost certainly void ordinances in Chicago and Oak Park, Ill., that forbid residents to have handguns at home. The justices ruled in favor of the Chicago residents who wish to have guns and sent the case back to Chicago for a lower court to issue a final ruling.
Legal experts on both sides of the gun-control debate predicted the ruling would trigger more lawsuits. They disagreed, however, about whether it would lead to gun laws being struck down, beyond a city's total ban on handguns.
"This case is only the beginning of the debate. Gun ownership rights -- like free-speech rights -- are not absolute, and state and local governments retain the authority to enact reasonable gun-control laws," said Rick Garnett, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.
Typically, residents can have a rifle or shotgun in any state without a permit. The main exceptions are for people with a felony record or who are mentally ill, and the Supreme Court has already said those "reasonable regulations" can stand.
Seven states, including California, forbid assault weapons or semiautomatic weapons, the court noted. Those restrictions will face a legal challenge, gun rights advocates said.
The National Rifle Assn. also said it planned to focus on how some laws were enforced.
For example, California authorizes residents to carry concealed weapons in public with permits. But NRA lawyers say that police in Los Angeles and San Francisco rarely issue permits, and they want to sue to challenge that practice.
"You will see lots of lawsuits, but the vast majority of laws are likely to be upheld," said UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, an expert on the 2nd Amendment. "The only thing we know for sure is that it's unconstitutional to prohibit possession of a handgun at home."
Though the high court split along ideological lines, the ruling won bipartisan praise in Washington, where Democrats have increasingly shied away from advocating gun control. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) joined Republicans in support of the outcome.
For their part, the justices are deeply split on both the meaning of the 2nd Amendment and wisdom of gun-control measures.
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who wrote the opinion for the majority, said crime data from the Chicago Police Department "reveal that the city's handgun murder rate has actually increased since the ban was enacted and that Chicago residents now face one of the highest murder rates in the country."
In dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said firearms "cause well over 60,000 deaths and injuries in the United States each year. Gun regulation may save lives. Some experts have calculated, for example, that Chicago's handgun ban has saved several hundred lives, perhaps close to 1,000, since it was enacted in 1983."
Two years ago, in a case from Washington, D.C., the court declared for the first time that the 2nd Amendment protects the gun rights of individuals. But the district is a federal city and not a state, and the ruling did not make clear whether state laws or city ordinances were affected.
In Monday's McDonald vs. Chicago decision, Alito explained that in the 20th century, the Bill of Rights was extended to apply to states and cities. There is no reason to leave out the 2nd Amendment, he said. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined to form the majority.
Alito repeated the court's earlier assurance that "reasonable regulations" of firearms can stand: "Despite the doomsday predictions" of the city's lawyers, extending the 2nd Amendment "does not imperil every law regulating firearms."
The dissenters said they feared the ruling would have a severe and dangerous effect across the country.
On his final day as a justice, John Paul Stevens said he continued to believe the 2nd Amendment was "adopted to protect the states from federal encroachment," not to undercut their gun laws.
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor joined Breyer's even longer dissent.
The court did not explain why it stopped short of striking the Chicago ordinance. But in the last two years, a federal judge and the U.S. court of appeals said that high court precedents barred them from striking down the Chicago ordinance. Now that those precedents have been set aside, the high court may have thought the judges in Chicago deserved the chance to rule directly on the constitutionality of the city's handgun ban.
Outside the court, NRA head Wayne LaPierre said it was a "monumental day."
He said the NRA "will not declare victory until any law-abiding citizen can go out, buy a firearm, own a firearm, protect themselves with it and use it for any other lawful purpose."
But Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, told reporters the ruling was not a surprise and set a "very narrow" definition of protected gun rights.
Alan Gura, the attorney for lead plaintiff Otis McDonald in the case, said, "People very, very soon in Chicago will be able to buy and lawfully possess handguns."

Other Supreme Court actions
UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS
The court agreed to hear an appeal from business and civil rights groups trying to overturn a 2007 Arizona law that prohibits employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. The state law was intended to lessen the economic incentive for immigrants to sneak into the U.S. by holding employers who hire them accountable. The prohibition is separate from an Arizona immigration law passed in April that requires police, after making a lawful stop, to question the immigration status of people they suspect are in the country illegally; that law is also being challenged in court. Supporters of the employer sanctions law say it was needed because the federal government hasn't adequately enforced a similar federal law. Critics contend that the law is an unconstitutional attempt by the state to regulate immigration and that cracking down on illegal hires is the sole responsibility of the federal government. Argument will take place in the court term that begins in October.
TOBACCO
The court rejected an attempt by the federal government to wrest billions of dollars in damages from the tobacco industry. The court also rejected, without comment, an appeal by the tobacco companies of a lower-court ruling that the companies had violated racketeering law by conspiring to lie for years to sell tobacco products they knew were dangerous. But the elimination of any potential for a large payout was seen as a victory for cigarette makers including Altria Group Inc.'s Philip Morris USA unit and Reynolds American Inc.'s R.J. Reynolds Tobacco unit.
HEALTHCARE
The court rejected a business-led challenge to San Francisco's universal healthcare program, which has enrolled more than 53,000 people who lacked health insurance. The justices denied an appeal from the Golden Gate Restaurant Assn. of an appeals court ruling that upheld the program's requirement that employers help pay the bill or give their workers health coverage.
CLERGY SEX ABUSE SCANDAL
The court refused to stop a lawsuit that accuses the Vatican of conspiring with U.S. church officials to transfer a priest from city to city despite repeated accusations that he sexually abused young people. The original lawsuit, John V. Doe vs. Holy See, was filed in 2002 by a Seattle-area man who says the priest, the Rev. Andrew Roman, repeatedly molested him in the late 1960s.
PATENTS
The court refused to weigh in on whether software, online-shopping techniques and medical diagnostic tests can be patented, saying only that inventors' request for protection of a method of hedging weather-related risk in energy prices cannot be granted. The high court unanimously agreed with a lower-court ruling that threw out Bernard Bilski and Rand Warsaw's patent, a decision many said could endanger patents in an increasingly high-tech world.

Full text: McChrystal's exit
Once again President Barack Obama is under attack, this time for firing Gen. Stanley McChrystal.
The president would also have come under fire by the same people for not having had the guts to stand up to insubordination.
Nearly 60 years after former President Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglass MacArthur, our country is still here, with a strong military and with a president able to rein it in if the situation warrants.
The same Constitution that gave the people the right to bear arms also put the military under civilian control, which was in the original document, not in an amendment.
We have a phrase for a government where generals run things: "military dictatorship."
(This is a good thing if they are on our side but bad if they are not.)
I just wonder if McChrystal considers the situation in Afghanistan hopeless and wanted out. A general must be foremost a great strategist and a shrewd politician, and he picked a brilliant strategy to leave: insult the president and get fired, putting the blame on Obama, and at the same time making himself look like a hero.
-- Larry Bunce, Oak Park
Change of heart
I, like millions of others, when President Barack Obama came on the presidential scene a couple of years ago, thought that he could part the sea, ride a rainbow and gather stars from the sky.
I voted for him.
Taking his sweet time after almost two years in office, Arizona had to take its own drastic actions due to his inaction in the Illegal immigration flow across its border; the oil still is still spewing in the Gulf; the economy is still a mess; there is still unemployment across the nation.
I'm starting to see this man as a mere mortal.
Reality finally kicked in for me.
But you have to give him credit on his quick dismissal of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a hero in the Afghanistan war, for being disrespectful.
At least now we know what Obama is good at: firing people and quickly.
Next time, if he gets re-elected in 2012, it won't be because of my vote.
-- Mauro Di Fiore, Chicago
Wasteful wars
This is in response to "Afghan anxiety" (Editorial, June 23). I couldn't believe that you said, "Don't forget why we are there: to deny a safe haven in Afghanistan and Pakistan for terrorists who are bent on attacking the U.S."
Terrorists are everywhere; no one knows who they are, and they are not sitting in little towns in Iraq or Afghanistan waiting to be killed by our forces.
Meanwhile our people are going hungry, schools are closing and more and more people are out of work, and we are spending a fortune for nine years on these wasteful, immoral wars.
How much longer will this go on?
-- Mona Stern, Gary, Ind.
Misguided loyalty
I first became a Cubs fan in 1945, the year the United States won World War II and the Cubs captured the National League Pennant.
What a great time to be alive!
I was 8 years old and brimming with confidence.
After all I was fortunate enough to be born in a championship city and in a nation that had emerged victoriously in the greatest conflict in human history.
Now, as an elderly man, I ask: Where has it all gone?
We've been in maybe a half dozen wars since 1945.
the reasons we entered them are murky and whether we won or lost is a matter of historical debate.
At any rate I'm convinced the post-1945 wars have done the nation no good at all.
And then there's the Cubs.
Why do so many of us in this sad city continue to support those overpaid, underachieving wrecks?
As a senior citizen, I can always say I favor the team because old habits are hard to break.
But what about you younger fans?
Do you follow the Cubs through some misguided notions of loyalty, civic pride, even chauvinism?
That sounds to me like the same reasons we followed our leaders into all those murky wars, which have done us no good.
-- R. Conrad Stein, Chicago
Cubs' history
Memo to Chicago Cubs new owner and team Chairman Tom Ricketts:
It's "a way of life" all right -- 102 years of it!
-- Joel Lazar, Homer Glen
Blame the parents
Your editorial about today's young people not growing up and not becoming independent adults until about the age 30 or so should send a wake-up call to their parents ("Oh, grow up," Editorial, June 21).
I think we can blame their parents for some of this lack of growing up: coddling them and pandering to their every whim, scheduling every free minute of time, not letting them go out and just play, giving them everything they want, being overly protective of them, confronting their teachers and going to court for every perceived slight, not giving them more responsibility.
I could go on and on.
But if parents would just let their children be more responsible for themselves instead of doing everything for them, maybe these children will grow up faster and become more responsible adults sooner.
-- Mario Caruso, Chicago
Poor choices
After reading all the Tribune's articles on senatorial candidates Mark Kirk and Alexi Giannoulias, I wish for once there was a none-of-the-above option.
I'm voting for neither candidate.
Politicians continually insult our intelligence and presume we can't read through them.
-- Paul Bedell, Tinley Park
Accurate cartoon
When I saw Tribune cartoonist Scott Stantis' cartoon on June 18 ("There's no recovery like the Obama recovery"), I thought at last someone is seeing it for what it is.
We have an economy in the tank.
A disaster in the Gulf.
A stimulus program that has not created any jobs after spending billions of dollars we do not have.
Families losing their homes.
When, in the June 24 Voice of the People section, I saw the two responses to the cartoon ("Mean cartoon," "Unfair cartoon"), I could not help but respond.
The cartoon is an honest depiction of what is happening to this country.
The jobs created were part-time jobs for the Census Bureau and government jobs.
These jobs will be over when the census is finished.
-- Wayne B. Etheridge, Chicago

Full text: Seeking to blunt an impending Republican attack on her fitness for the Supreme Court, Elena Kagan said Monday that if confirmed she would consider every case "impartially, modestly, with commitment to principle and in accordance to the law."
Kagan, tapped for the high court by President Barack Obama in May, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on the first day of her confirmation hearing that as a justice she would listen to arguments from all sides "across every apparent political or ideological divide."
"No one has a monopoly on truth or wisdom," Kagan said.
Republican members of the committee expressed doubts whether Kagan, a former White House official during the Clinton administration, can set aside her political views.
"We don't have any substantive evidence to demonstrate your ability to transition from a legal scholar and political operative to a fair and impartial jurist," Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, told her.
Beyond that, Republicans made it clear they will grill her this week on a series of issues, including gun rights, illegal immigration, same-sex marriage and campaign-finance regulation.
They also voiced concern about the fact that she has never served as a judge at any level. "Ms. Kagan has less real legal experience (than) any nominee in at least 50 years," said Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the committee's top Republican.
Democrats, conversely, praised her as a supremely qualified candidate who would be able to distinguish between the role of policy-maker and judge.
"There is no basis to question her integrity, and no one should presume that this intelligent woman, who has excelled during every part of her varied and distinguished career, lacks independence," said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the committee chairman.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called Kagan's lack of judicial experience "refreshing," but at least one Democrat, Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, noted her judicial philosophy "is almost invisible to us."
Kagan, 50, has served as the government's lawyer before the high court for the past year. Beyond her work in the Clinton White House, she is a former dean of Harvard Law School and most of her career has been spent in academia. She's the youngest nominee to come before the committee since Clarence Thomas in 1991.
Of the Republicans, most eyes remained on Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who bucked his party last year and supported nominee Sonia Sotomayor. Graham on Monday was both complimentary of Kagan and skeptical. He defended her work as U.S. solicitor general but said he was troubled by her efforts, while dean of Harvard Law, to deny military recruiters access to the law campus because of the Pentagon's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
Kagan was introduced by Massachusetts Sens. John Kerry, a Democrat, and Scott Brown, a Republican -- perhaps a politically savvy move. Brown's support could be instrumental in ensuring the GOP cannot filibuster Kagan's nomination. Still, with Democrats holding 58 seats in the Senate, a clear path to the court seems almost assured, as one senator noted Monday.
"I don't want to take any suspense out of these proceedings," said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, "but things are looking good for your confirmation."
- - -
Heard at the hearing
"I've learned that we come closest to getting things right when we approach every person and every issue with an open mind."
-- Elena Kagan
"Ms. Kagan has less real legal experience (than) any nominee in at least 50 years. It's not just that she has never been a judge. She has barely practiced law, and not with the intensity and duration from which real understanding occurs."
-- Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.
"Elena Kagan has great potential to moderate a court that is veering out of the mainstream."
-- Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
"We have less evidence about what sort of judge you will be than on any nominee in recent memory. Your judicial philosophy is almost invisible to us."
-- Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis.

Full text: In announcing which cases it would take during its next term, the Supreme Court said Monday that it would let stand a lower-court ruling allowing the Vatican to be sued over the church sex-abuse scandal, indicated it would review one of Arizona's controversial immigration laws and declined to get involved in landmark anti-tobacco-industry litigation.
In declining to stop a lawsuit that accuses the Vatican of conspiring with U.S. church officials to cover up sex abuse, the court took a rare step toward bringing the Holy See into a U.S. courtroom.
The justices, without comment, declined the Vatican's appeal of a lower-court ruling that said it could be sued in a U.S. court on certain grounds. The decision came in a lawsuit filed by a man who said he was sexually abused as a teenager in 1965 by a priest in Portland, Ore. His attorneys said the church moved the priest among different assignments to cover up the abuse.
The Vatican argued that its status as a foreign country exempts it from being sued in a U.S. court, a longtime position that has helped shield it from such lawsuits.
In partially rejecting that argument, the Supreme Court allowed pretrial discovery in the case to go forward, and attorneys for the plaintiff said they would seek to subpoena church documents and call Vatican officials under oath. But attorneys for both sides said they doubted that the decision would trigger a flood of additional lawsuits from victims.
"We are not foreseeing that. You really have to have specific facts and a pattern that implicates direct Vatican involvement to bring these cases," said Jeff Anderson, an attorney for the plaintiff and for hundreds of other people who say they were sexually abused by priests.
The court agreed to review an Arizona law that sanctions employers for hiring illegal immigrants. The law was designed to discourage immigrants from coming into the country by holding employers accountable for giving them a job.
It is distinct from the new Arizona law that President Obama and other members of his administration have recently criticized. That measure empowers police to question anyone who authorities have a "reasonable suspicion" is an illegal immigrant.
With the Justice Department preparing a lawsuit against Arizona over the new law, the court's decision to review the earlier measure -- the Legal Arizona Workers Act -- signals a willingness to get involved in one of the nation's most politically divisive issues. The Obama administration had urged the court to review and set aside the Legal Arizona Workers Act, saying federal immigration law should preempt state efforts.
U.S. officials have said that in its suit against Arizona's law empowering police to question illegal immigrants, the Justice Department is considering a similar "preemption" argument.
The court declined to get involved in the government's lawsuit against the tobacco industry, which is more than a decade old, leaving in place a ruling that said cigarette makers lied about the dangers of smoking.
The rejection of a series of tobacco cases closes a legal odyssey that began when the Justice Department sued tobacco companies and trade groups in 1999. The court declined to hear appeals of the 2006 ruling by a federal judge that said the industry conspired for decades to defraud the public about smoking's hazards.
Legal analysts said the decision is a mixed verdict for the tobacco industry because it could expose tobacco companies to additional legal liability but prevents the Obama administration from seeking to recover $280 billion in past industry profits or $14 billion for a national campaign to curb smoking. The Supreme Court previously denied the government's appeal on that issue.
"This forever eliminates the potential of a large-scale financial recovery from the industry in this case," said David Adelman, a tobacco industry analyst at Morgan Stanley. "In terms of affecting the business, turning off consumers, I don't think it's going to have any effect."
He added that being forced to pay the $280 billion would have been "the end" of the industry.

Full text: A University of California law school's refusal to give official student group status to a Christian society that excluded gays was a reasonable application of the school's nondiscrimination policy, the Supreme Court said Monday in a 5-4 ruling.
The Christian Legal Society chapter had sued the University of California's Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, arguing that denial of school recognition and of access to state funding and facilities violated the group's First and 14th Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association and the free exercise of religion.
The society chapter, formed at the law school in 2004, required members to forswear "unrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle," which it defined as sex outside of heterosexual marriage.
The court's opinion, written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said the law school's decision was reasonable in that the state-funded university requires all groups wearing its endorsement to be nondiscriminatory.
"Hastings, through its (Registered Student Organization) program, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition," Ginsburg wrote in the opinion, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.
In other action, the Supreme Court:
*Refused to consider whether the Vatican has legal immunity over the sexual abuse of minors by priests in the U.S., allowing a 2002 lawsuit to go forward.
The case in question involves the late Rev. Andrew Ronan, a Servite priest who victims' lawyers say was sent to Chicago after being accused of molesting children in his native Ireland. Archdiocesan officials said Ronan worked for St. Philip High School on Chicago's West Side from 1960 through 1965. He was then transferred to a Catholic school in Oregon, where he reportedly assaulted the victim in this case. St. Philip closed in 1970.
*Said it would hear a legal challenge to a 2007 Arizona law that punishes employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. The court will decide whether the state law infringes on federal immigration powers.
*Rejected the U.S. government's attempt to wrest billions of dollars in damages from the tobacco industry, a decision that helped lift tobacco stocks.

Full text: For years, the Rev. Jose Landaverde has been a tireless advocate for immigration reform, his insatiable appetite for attention to the cause once leading him to camp overnight outside a detention center in Broadview to show that activists like him won't go away until Congress acts on the issue.
His latest campaign is leaving Landaverde, 42, weak and breathless.
Since June 17, Landaverde has been on a diet of water and fruit juice as part of a planned chain of "hunger strikes" meant to draw more urgency to calls for federal legislators to overhaul the nation's immigration system. Landaverde, who has diabetes, took over from another minister, the Rev. Martin Santellano, who, supporters say, went 32 days without solid foods.
"I am not doing this because I think something big is going to happen" as a result from Congress or the Obama administration, said Landaverde from Our Lady of Guadalupe Anglican Mission, the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago storefront church in Little Village where he is pastor. "It is more to create conscience; what I am doing is just raising conscience in the people."
Pushing the immigration issue to the top of the federal agenda has been challenging amid a string of national emergencies -- from the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico to turmoil over the war in Afghanistan and the U.S. economy.
While President Barack Obama has expressed a willingness to take on immigration reform, his administration has so far mostly responded with tougher enforcement against illegal immigration, including a request to Congress last week for $500 million to hire 1,000 more Border Patrol agents.
Groups pushing for even more enforcement argue that not enough is being done. Meanwhile, immigrant advocates like Landaverde have grown increasingly frustrated, and anxious.
"I feel powerless," Landaverde said, emphasizing, however, that he has little sympathy for felons in the country illegally. "All of these families come and ask me to talk to immigration or go to court with them, and one can't do anything besides guide them through the logistics."
That nagging sense of ineffectiveness has led to increasingly dramatic methods of protest, including the hunger strike.
Along those lines, activists in Chicago and other cities also plan a rally in Washington next month with children of deported immigrants. Their hope is that the trip will add symbolic weight to a movement that sometimes appears lackluster as time passes.
Landaverde said he's unsure how long he'll keep up his hunger strike. A doctor has warned him against continuing, he said, comparing the risk of someone with diabetes going without food to a pregnant woman starving herself.
A survivor of torture in El Salvador's civil war who arrived in the U.S. in the early 1990s as a political asylum seeker, he's used to enduring pain and discomfort, he said.
Both his parents were killed by government soldiers when he was a boy in El Salvador, he said. An uncle took Landaverde to join the guerrilla movement. In 1990, he was arrested, then beaten and left for dead at a riverbank with a group of other suspected guerrillas who had been captured. Some Jesuit priests came by and rescued them.
The experience, Landaverde said, colors his work today as an Episcopalian priest and an immigration activist.
"I feel like we are facing a civil war now" over immigration, he said, pausing to catch his breath as his undernourished body worked against him.

Full text: Author: Harvey Klehr; John Earl Haynes
The Justice Department's arrest this week of 10 Russian spies posing as American citizens is not stranger than fiction; it mirrors fiction. Innumerable Cold War novels and films focused on "sleeper agents," professional Soviet espionage officers superbly trained in language and culture who take on the identity of a native-born American to gain access to U.S. intelligence and policy making.
But in reality the most damaging Cold War spies were native-born Americans--Julius Rosenberg, Alger Hiss, Aldrich Ames, Richard Hansen--who for reasons of ideology, money or psychological perversity chose to betray their country.
Most Soviet espionage was supervised by "legal" KGB officers operating under official cover as diplomats who, when arrested, faced only expulsion, protected by their diplomatic status. Great Britain famously expelled 105 Soviet personnel linked to KGB intelligence in 1971. But none of them had been posing as a British citizen. The KGB also had "illegal" officers who had no diplomatic status, often used false identities and who usually functioned as covert liaisons with native-born traitors. Long-term sleeper agents, as these 10 appear to have been, are rare.
In the late-1950s, the U.S. government arrested, tried and convicted five Soviet illegals in connection with the Soble-Soblen spy ring: Jack Soble, his wife Myra, his brother Robert Soblen (the two brothers had anglicized their Lithuanian name, Sobolevicius, slightly differently), Jacob Albam and Mark Zborowski. None had diplomatic cover, but neither were they "deep penetration" agents. All used their true identities, simply pretending to be innocent immigrants.
Moreover, their espionage work was confined largely to "agent handling," i.e., acting as liaison with native-born Americans, mostly Communists, who had been recruited as Soviet spies years earlier. Their major accomplishment was to infiltrate the American Trotskyist movement and the Russian emigrÃ© community, targets with no direct connection to the U.S. government. Soble and associates had no plans or prospects of entering American think tanks or other institutions with access to high-level American policy makers.
There were two Soviet illegals exposed in the late 1950s whose activities came a bit closer to the recently arrested 10. An illegal officer, KGB Col. Rudolf Abel (real name Vilyam Fisher), entered the U.S. in 1948 and operated under a variety of false identities. He was finally exposed when his assistant and fellow illegal, KGB Lt. Col. Reino Hayhanen, defected in 1957. (Hayhanen, of Finnish background, had been sent to the U.S. using false papers identifying him as an American of Finnish ancestry.) Abel, who never admitted his real name, was convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison.
After only five years he was freed in exchange for Francis Gary Powers, the U-2 pilot shot down over the Soviet Union on a CIA reconnaissance mission. While Hayhanen and Abel assumed false identities as Americans, their function was to maintain contact and pick up information from native-born Americans who spied for the Soviets. Abel's initial task, for example, was to re-establish KGB contact with Theodore Hall, an American physicist and secret Communist who had provided U.S. atomic secrets to the USSR while working at Los Alamos. Hayhanen and Abel were illegals but not deep-penetration sleeper agents.
Thus, the FBI's arrest of 10 Russian sleeper agents on U.S. soil has no precedent in Cold War history, even if fans of Walter Wager's novel "Telefon" (later a movie staring Charles Bronson) find it familiar. Also unprecedented, and reassuringly so, is that FBI counterintelligence had identified these Russian sleepers early on, had been monitoring them for years, and finally decided that it had gained what it could from such surveillance and rolled up the Russian networks.
Deep-penetration agents are a very, very expensive investment. Not only the training of the professional officers themselves, but covertly supporting them, communicating with them, and supervising their activities is a major bureaucratic expense for any intelligence agency. The loss of 10 such agents and the resulting collateral damage makes this a catastrophe for Russian foreign intelligence. The FBI also identified a number of Russian "legal" officers who made surreptitious contact with the sleepers and, thus exposed, these Russian officers are now useless for intelligence fieldwork.
The SVR--Russian Foreign Intelligence, successor to the KGB--also cannot be sure that the FBI has disclosed all that it knows of the 10 agents' activities (11 with the arrest of a confederate in Cyprus). Prudence dictates that the SVR must assume that any other Russian officers who had covert contact with the 11 may have been identified by American security. Use of these potentially compromised officers in future espionage field-work would be risky and foolish.
We don't know what additional shoes will drop in this case. Will any of the 10 talk to avoid a long prison term? Rudolf Abel was defiant and refused any cooperation. Jack Soble, however, dodged the death penalty by fully confessing, telling all he knew of KGB operations in the U.S. and Western Europe, and even testified against his brother. These 10 (or 11, if we count the agent arrested in Cyprus) don't face the death penalty but do face potentially long terms in prison, and there aren't any Francis Gary Powers available for exchanges.

Paul and Daisy Soros have dedicated another $25 million to help children of immigrants pay for graduate school in the U.S., expanding a family charitable trust that already has awarded more than $30 million to almost 400 students.
Mr. Soros, the 84-year-old older brother of hedge-fund manager George Soros and a former athlete, first arrived in Manhattan with a pittance, having defected while traveling to Switzerland with the 1948 Hungarian Olympic ski team.
He saw that trip as his chance to escape his Communist-controlled homeland after World War II, he says.
That first year in New York planted the seed for what would become the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans.
Mr. Soros wanted to study engineering in a top graduate program, but he couldn't afford Ivy League schools. Instead he chose the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, struggling to pay for meals and cheap housing near Prospect Park.
Mr. Soros's master's degree from Brooklyn served him well: He went on to run a global engineering firm and eventually owned interests in shipping concerns. Mr. Soros in the 1980s and 1990s also helped his brother George's firm select industrial investments for the famous Quantum family of funds.
Still, Paul Soros never forgot arriving in the U.S. with boundless educational ambitions but limited options.
In 1998, when the Soroses were considering how to distribute their endowment, which started with $50 million, Mr. Soros wanted to focus on lightening the burden for immigrants and children of immigrants aiming to pursue graduate degrees.
"We didn't know how to start," the 80-year-old Mrs. Soros says.
"Having a building with our name on it doesn't appeal to me," Mr. Soros says.
Soros fellowship recipients must demonstrate an original idea or talent; they must have accomplished something requiring a sustained effort; and they must have participated in government or another forum dedicated to freedoms prescribed in the U.S. Bill of Rights.
Each year, 30 fellows receive up to $90,000 to help cover two years of tuition and other educational and living expenses, to study any subject at any U.S. university. Mr. Soros says "I was hoping that this fellowship would make a real contribution to American culture, the economy and the citizens of this country," says Mr. Soros. he and his wife increased the endowment to recognize more contributions by immigrants to business, arts, science, education, government, courts, nonprofits and other areas, amid efforts they view as increasingly anti-immigrant.
Soros fellowship recipients from the past 12 years have gone on to start companies, compose celebrated works of music, serve as lawyers in the White House, teach political science and help develop new medicines.
Mrs. Soros is chairman of the endowment. Mr. Soros remains involved in key decisions. However, his health limits his day-to-day involvement, since he has Parkinson's disease and diabetes and has been treated for jaw and tongue cancer, which are in remission. The Soroses' son Jeffrey became president of the fellowship this year, and their son Peter helps oversee investments. The endowment is primarily invested in Soros Fund Management's Quantum funds, according to Mr. Soros.

Full text: Seldom has the policy conflict between recovery and reform been presented as starkly as in the last two weeks.
On the one hand, there is last week's congressional agreement on a historic reshaping of the financial regulatory system -- which brings stronger consumer protections, sharper oversight of mega-banks and risk-oriented behavior, new constraints on mortgage terms and closer scrutiny of credit rating agencies and insurance companies.
On the other, there's the failure of Congress (thanks to the threat of a Republican filibuster in the Senate) to extend unemployment coverage for more than 1 million Americans and to provide about $24 billion in Medicaid assistance for state budgets. That places as many as 900,000 public- and private-sector jobs, not to mention crucial services for destitute residents, at risk.
Not helping matters was the noise coming from last weekend's G-20 summit of developed countries in Toronto about the need to cut fiscal deficits by 2013.
Plainly, while reform is beginning to move ahead, economic recovery is still very much at risk. The main threat comes from short-sighted policymakers who, despite an abundance of evidence that growth remains dependent on continued fiscal stimulus, have become unduly enamored of austerity instead.
There's no question that the stimulus already in the system has pulled the world economy back from the brink.
"We're in a very different place than we were a year ago," Lawrence H. Summers, director of President Obama's National Economic Council, said last week in a conversation in his West Wing office with a group of us from The Times. "A year ago the question was about a free fall, it was about depression. Today the questions are about the pace of recovery. That's a much better kind of question to hear."
He added: "We've
begun the process of turnaround.A The challenge going forward is to maintain and accelerate momentum."
It's important to note that the momentum of which he spoke is fragile in the extreme. Gross domestic product is rising, but the annual growth rate in the first quarter of this year, 2.7%, is slower than that of the previous quarter (5.6%). It's also slower than the rate needed for job growth to keep pace with population growth (3%) or the 5% needed to bring down the unemployment rate, which is 9.7%.
The economy has added jobs since the beginning of the year, but employment in May was still below the level of May 2009.
How important is government stimulus? The modest job growth this year incorporates a large component of government hiring -- the increase of 431,000 in nonfarm employment in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, included 411,000 temporary workers hired for the 2010 census. And although home prices have stabilized in much of the country, new-home sales collapsed by 33% in May, following the April 30 expiration of a federal tax credit for home purchasers.
It's not as though the economy didn't face enough crosswinds already. Long-term unemployment has become "a particularly disturbing feature of this recession," Summers said.
"There is evidence that people who have been out of work for a year tend to have a difficult time returning and often drop out of the labor force," he said. "That is going to cast a shadow for some significant interval."
Nor has there been a reversal in the trend toward increasing income inequality in the United States. In 1979, the top 1% of U.S. households earned eight times as much as the middle 20% and 23 times as much as the bottom fifth; by 2005, the Congressional Budget Office found, the upper crust touched 21 times as much as the middle class and 70 times as much as the bottom.
This phenomenon "has a broadly corrosive social impact in terms of our not being one America," said Summers, echoing the economist Benjamin M. Friedman, who observed in 2006 that the 1950s and '60s, when median family income doubled, brought us such progressive social developments as the civil rights movement.
Over the succeeding decades the social fabric has frayed, Friedman wrote. Public opinion has turned sharply against immigration and affirmative action, and attacks on welfare recipients display "a vindictive spirit that was highly uncharacteristic of the United States in the postwar era."
Things may be headed downward from here. The death last week of a $100-billion jobs and economic relief bill will place unimaginable strain on state and local budgets, provoking cuts that may well undo all the progress that was made under last year's $787-billion stimulus package.
That package, according to an analysis by the California Budget Project, provided $85 billion in funds for California alone. It helped lawmakers in Sacramento close the last budget gap by increasing federal funding for Medi-Cal -- relieving pressure on the state budget while restricting cuts in eligibility, thereby safeguarding coverage for many low-income Californians.
Yet Congress' action pulls the rug out from the residents of California and other states. The Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that 33 states and the District of Columbia had enacted budgets incorporating, directly or indirectly, money they expected from the bill. That doesn't include California, where Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said this year that his 2010-11 budget proposal assumed an inflow of $1.8 billion in Medicaid/Medi-Cal funding -- which has been, for now, extinguished.
The state budget reductions, wage cuts, furloughs and layoffs that will be made necessary by Congress' dereliction will
drive up unemployment, erode consumer demand and intensify doubts about the strength of the recovery.
What is the source of the deficit panic that's fueling the pushback on economic stimulus? It's certainly not the public's conviction that government assistance is no longer needed. It's hard to identify a widespread perception that the economy has turned up, although Summers argues that such perception always lags behind reality.
"Recoveries are more like rheostats than light switches," he said. "People are gradually getting the sense of improvement.A But it won't feel like everything is better all of a sudden. It will take time."
Is it bond investors fearful that deficit spending will drive up long-term interest rates, harming their portfolios, as the economist Paul Krugman posits? Or is it someone's Machiavellian effort to prove the correctness of Keynesian economics, which supports heavy government stimulus in periods when the private sector withdraws from investment, by imposing anti-Keynesian stimulus cuts while they're still needed?
John Maynard Keynes, it should be noted, was unafraid of government deficits. "At the present time, all governments have large deficits," he wrote in 1931, as his biographer Robert Skidelsky observed recently. "They are nature's remedy for preventing business losses from being ... so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill."
A few years later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt bowed to his era's deficit hawks and cut back on federal programs to bring the federal budget more into balance. He got the recession of 1937 for his pains.
The deficit-cutting craze of the modern day threatens another such double dip. Its promoters say they're out to protect long-term economic prospects, but without a short-term recovery there may not be a long term to protect. If they get their way, we may not feel the consequences of their error before it's too late to fix.

Officials in Arizona and Texas are clamoring for more National Guard troops along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that their share of a planned new deployment won't be enough to make a dent in illegal immigration.
After a meeting Monday with Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, officials with the Obama administration announced that Arizona would receive a sizable share of the 1,200 planned new troops, 524. That is more than double the number allocated to any of the other three border states, even though Arizona abuts only about 19% of the U.S.-Mexican border.
By comparison, Texas is set to receive 250 guard troops, even though it has 60% of the 2,000-mile border. California will receive 224 and New Mexico 72, the administration announced. The remaining troops would report to a national liaison office.
Texas and Arizona, both led by Republican governors, immediately complained about their allocations. "Obviously, that is not sufficient to secure the border," said Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Texas Gov. Rick Perry. "We're going to continue to urge the federal government to provide the resources we need."
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer expressed similar concern and said that the 524 troops were not what she had hoped she would receive.
Tensions have already been high between Ms. Brewer and the Obama administration after the governor signed a law requiring police who are enforcing other laws to check the immigration status of anyone they suspect of being in the country illegally. The Obama administration has threatened to sue Arizona over the law.
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs responded to complaints from the governors by saying the administration's effort to secure the border has been extraordinary. "The president has made a big commitment to securing the border," he said Tuesday. President Obama is expected to make a speech on immigration laws Thursday.
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, struck more conciliatory tones. Mr. Schwarzenegger, in a statement, applauded President Obama for sending the additional troops. However, he too said he would "continue to urge the federal government to provide more National Guard personnel for our border."
Mr. Richardson's office called the Obama administration announcement a good first step.
Texas and Arizona say that crime is high along their borders and there is an imminent need for amped-up security.
The sector of the border that includes Tucson, Ariz., had more arrests of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the border than any other sector, with 241,000 in 2009, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The next closest was the San Diego sector with 119,000 arrests. Still, the arrests in the Tucson sector in 2009 were down 36% from 2007.
Federal legislation sponsored by Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, would bring 6,000 National Guard troops to the four border states. Arizona has requested 3,000 of those.
"Those numbers are more in line with what is usually estimated as needed to secure the border," said Fred Burton, a former special agent with the state department and a vice president of intelligence at Stratfor, a global intelligence company.
A similar bill in May failed to garner the necessary 60 votes in the Senate to clear procedural hurdles. This more recent amendment, co-sponsored by Texas's Senate delegation and Jon Kyl of Arizona, all Republicans, was passed out of the Senate Armed Services Committee but the likelihood of passage by the full Senate is unclear.
All states have the authority to call up their own National Guard troops but would have to pay for them at a time when many face extreme budget pressures. If the troops are called up by the president, the cost is borne by federal tax dollars.

Full text: Re "Mexican flags wave again," June 25
Mexican immigrants who say their allegiance is 100% to America nevertheless root for the Mexican soccer team in the World Cup competition, over that of the U.S.
Anyone has the perfect right to cheer on any team whatsoever, for any reason. It's all in good fun, anyway, especially with modest amounts of bourbon or tequila. But the question is raised: How long must a person call the U.S. their home before they identify with its teams?
I think my forbears were from England. I do not root for the English team to beat America's. I also was born in another state, but I favor California schools in competition with those from my former home.
So what, you ask? Not much, I guess. The World Cup comes only every four years -- and we have the good fortune to have fun and yell for somebody as an antidote to the world's ills. Cheers.

Re "Soccer kicking up race debate," June 26
The French are a sophisticated and complex people.
It is simplistic to blame mere racism for the ire they've directed toward their national soccer team.
Many of these players have taken on an "American" professional athlete persona of misbehavior and "bling."
The French are reacting much more to bad manners and the flaunting of wealth than to anything else. That is what has triggered this giant wave of disapproval.

Nationalism in England
Re "England's ugly nationalism has become kinder, gentler," June 24
It is not "uncharitable" for my homeland's citizens to resist the Islamicization of England, any more than it is uncharitable for us U.S. citizens to resist laws or actions here that we believe are unconstitutional.
Five years ago London's Tate Art Gallery withdrew an art exhibit because it feared offending Muslim visitors. The exhibit was fine for English sensibilities.
The museum was wrong to fear offending a "guest."
When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When in England or in the U.S., our rules and values hold sway. Our concept of human rights is worth defending.

Afghanistan's latest dupe
Re "Who's in charge in Afghanistan?," Opinion, June 27
Who's in charge of Afghanistan?
It's the Afghans now -- as it has always been throughout their long and troubled history.
These tribal peoples have defeated such vaunted powers as Alexander the Great, the British Empire and most recently the deceased Soviet Union -- and they are well on their way to vanquishing the latest foolhardy empire: the United States.
Gen. David H. Petraeus ultimately will be no more successful in taming this country than past imperial regimes.
As with Vietnam, our American political leadership has once again failed this nation by utterly ignoring history.
It's time to extricate ourselves, now!

The crowds at County-USC
Re "Crowding is severe at County-USC," June 26
As a resident physician in the Los Angeles County healthcare system, I say shame on Supervisor Michael Antonovich for scapegoating a vulnerable population -- "a large illegal immigrant population" -- to explain the Board of Supervisors' inefficiencies.
While they sit in their ivory tower, healthcare professionals are working hard to clean up the mess caused by their band-aid approach to health services. Physicians and management continue to work on efficiencies at our county hospitals. All we ask for is a Board of Supervisors with foresight in planning for the needs of our patients and our communities.
Such foresight requires leaders who are willing to invest in our health system and not skimp on services that are always highly utilized. In the end, "cost-saving measures" (i.e., reducing hospital beds) actually cost us more, especially in dire economic times such as now.

::
The new Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center was in the planning stages for years before it was built. Health and medical experts and organizations recommended 750 beds. Despite this, the Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 to build 600 beds (Gloria Molina being the exception). A new 80-bed hospital was supposed to be built in the San Gabriel Valley.
Today's overcrowding is no surprise, nor is the fact that the smaller hospital was abandoned years ago.

Big council salaries in Bell
Re "D.A. looks into city of Bell's salaries," June 24
To say that close to $100,000 in yearly compensation for members of the part-time City Council in Bell, a financially struggling city of about 40,000, is outrageously obscene is a significant understatement!
And now the city of Maywood is disbanding its Police Department, laying off all its municipal employees and transferring its day-to-day field operations to Bell.
Don't do it! Bad decisions result in bad results!
I am blessed that I chose to live in the little city of Lomita.

Americans' poor diet choices
Re "More diet tips to ignore," Editorial, June 26
I completely disagree that the recent USDA recommendations will not be followed because Americans don't have the time to eat moderate portions, exercise and improve their cooking skills.
I believe they do have the time but are lazy. If some of the hours consumed by Americans on social networking, watching mindless TV and Internet gaming and surfing were applied to healthful endeavors and exercise, our obese Americans would lose weight, be happier and reduce healthcare costs overall.
Richard Spaniardi

::
That Americans spend 48.9% of their food dollars away from home is shocking.
The time one spends standing in line for a fast-food meal is probably longer than it takes to prepare a meal at home, which would certainly be more nourishing, more appealing and less expensive.

Ignorant of tobacco risks
Re "A colorful death by tobacco," Opinion, June 24
About cigarettes, Meghan Daum writes, "Everyone knows by now that they're killers."
Au contraire. Researchers who studied smokers wrote in Tobacco Control in 2005: "...the accumulated data demonstrate convincingly that smokers have a very imperfect understanding of the risks of smoking and of risk statistics in general. Furthermore, regardless of what they may acknowledge about the risks faced by other smokers, they believe that their own risk is less. Given the accumulated evidence, the argument that people begin to smoke or continue to smoke with adequate knowledge of the potential risks appears indefensible."
We all have a stake in this issue due to the cost of medical insurance and other factors, and therefore it is in our interest to let the FDA know we support further deglamorization, including no color in packaging except for a big red WARNING on the package.

Week after week, columnist Vicky Pelaez hammered away at U.S. policy in the pages of a New York City newspaper.
"The essence of capitalism is exploitation and permanent expansion to ensure profit growth and the power of mega-corporations...," Ms. Pelaez, a native of Peru, wrote in a 2007 column for El Diario La Prensa, a Spanish-language daily.
Anna Chapman seemed to have a different view of an immigrant's life in New York. In an interview posted on YouTube, Ms. Chapman compared the U.S. to her native Russia. "Here, meeting the most successful people is easier than anywhere else in the world. If in Moscow it's practically impossible...then in New York everything is different," she said. "You can go to dinner with your neighbor and...meet the most important venture capitalist tonight."
The two women did share one goal, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation: They were among 11 defendants working as "deep cover" Russian agents, sent to the U.S. to assume fake identities and "develop ties in policymaking circles." All have been charged with conspiracy to act as unauthorized agents of foreign governments. Nine are also charged with conspiracy to launder money. Of the five defendants arrested in the New York area, the men are being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, and the women at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.
The suspects lived in areas across the country, from Boston to Seattle, with five of them settling in the New York area. Their alleged schemes took place in the most public of places: a Times Square coffee shop, a Long Island Rail Road station in Queens, a downtown bookstore.
The espionage tale stunned those who knew the New York suspects. Ms. Pelaez's family, colleagues and lawyer said the case against her was thin. Her husband, Juan Lazaro, also was among the accused.
In an interview Tuesday outside the couple's home, Waldo Mariscal said his mother and stepfather have no ties to Russia and have never visited the country, he said. "It's preposterous," said Mr. Mariscal, an architect.
Ms. Pelaez arrived in the U.S. more than 20 years ago; earlier, while working in Peru as a TV reporter, she was kidnapped. Her husband, Mr. Lazaro, taught a Latin American class at Baruch University. Neighbors noted summer barbecues with South American music.
Mr. Lazaro claimed to be a Peruvian citizen born in Uruguay, according to the complaint. But in 2002, federal agents heard him at home talking about his childhood with Ms. Pelaez. He told her: "We moved to Siberia...as soon as the war started," the complaint says.
Colleagues describe Ms. Pelaez as an opinionated columnist with a flair for painting, a love of ceviche and pride in her teenage son's piano skills.
"She dedicated so much time to her painting and El Diario I don't know how she could find time to spy," said Candida Portugues, a reporter at El Diario La Prensa. "She did all kinds of stuff. I don't know. It's very difficult for me to believe this."
Ms. Chapman's lawyer voiced similar disbelief. Ms. Chapman is a 28-year-old divorced Russian national who moved to the U.S. full-time last year. "This is a...very intelligent woman," said lawyer Robert Baum. "She has a master's in economics, she speaks fluently several languages and she ran her own real-estate company through the Internet, which was a very lucrative and successful business. She doesn't fit the profile of a spy that they make her out to be."
It was Ms. Chapman who met last Saturday with an undercover FBI agent posing as a Russian embassy official, according to the complaint.
Two other suspects, Richard and Cynthia Murphy of Montclair, N.J., were also described as blending into their suburban lifestyles. The couple moved to the U.S. in the mid-1990s.
Mrs. Murphy has worked at Morea Financial Services in Manhattan for 13 years and is currently a vice president, conducting "comprehensive Financial Planning and Tax Accounting services for high net-worth individuals," according to a profile on the business networking site LinkedIn. She received an MBA from Columbia Business School last month.
The 55-page complaint reads like a Cold War spy thriller. For example, it says Ms. Pelaez was caught on video accepting a bag from an individual in a park in a South American country in 2000. She was also allegedly overheard by FBI agents on several occasions discussing with her husband the transactions, which involved large amounts of money, and instructing him to pass a note to a presumed Russian agent in invisible ink, according to the complaint.
"Who knows what she's doing, who she's talking to?" her attorney, John M. Rodriguez, said of the meeting in the park. "I don't know if any money exchanged hands or not....And I suspect the U.S. government has no way of knowing either."
Mr. Rodriguez said that Ms. Pelaez wasn't concealing her identity, unlike some of the other defendants, and that her relationship with Mr. Lazaro dates back 30 years, prior to the alleged conspiracy with Russia. He said they'd been married for 17 years. While she may be "leftist leaning," he said, that does not make her a spy.

Full text: Landlord Michael Sparks doesn't consider himself an activist, but he went to court after police erected barricades and started running a checkpoint at his apartment complex, home to many Latinos.
"They ... started ticketing Mexican immigrants at 2 a.m., when our residents were trying to get back home" after finishing work, said Sparks, 70, who argued in federal and state lawsuits that the barricades were unconstitutional.
Officials in Rolling Meadows recently said the city is close to reaching an out-of-court settlement of the lawsuits, filed in 2008 by Sparks, adjacent property owners and two residents of his 12 Oaks of Woodfield apartments.
But any resolution of the legal battle appears unlikely to heal the often fractious relationship between the city and Sparks, who is trying to sell his 700-unit complex.
Most recently, Sparks and the city were at odds over the swimming pool. Officials declined to let him fill it because he is behind in paying his water bill, he said.
City officials say the police initiative at 12 Oaks in 2008 was well-intentioned and in no way "anti-immigrant." But some experts questioned the wisdom of that tactic, saying it illustrates the tensions that have arisen in Chicago-area communities with sizable immigrant populations.
The debate has become especially heated in light of a new Arizona law that allows police to check someone's legal status during stops if they suspect the person is in this country illegally.
The fact that the barricades and checkpoints affected a predominantly Latino population remains troubling, said DePaul University Professor Leonard Cavise. Residents who were required to pass through a police checkpoint and endure the inconvenience of limited access to the parking lot because of the barricades were not accused of committing any crimes.
"It sounds like Rolling Meadows was a trendsetter, and Arizona learned from Illinois," said Cavise, adding that while it is not unusual for police in Southwestern states to erect barricades and checkpoints while conducting border searches, the practice is not commonplace elsewhere in the country.
"To see the barricades going up in Illinois ... is rare," Cavise said. "It looks like racial profiling, which the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled is unconstitutional."
Nicol Savoy, a program manager at 12 Oaks, stops short of alleging that the barricade episode was racial profiling.
But she said the police initiative was both an overreaction and an unnecessary inconvenience to the neighborhood's Latino immigrant families.
"Some people were angry, but most of them were just wondering what the community had done wrong to warrant a barricade," said Savoy, who coordinates the 12 Oaks youth soccer program, as well as ESL, parenting and preschool readiness classes offered to residents at the complex.
In June 2008 police used concrete and construction barriers to block 12 of the 13 entrances to the complex, where about 2,000 people live. Two police officers were stationed at the only open entrance for several hours a day.
Police said they wanted to deter crime in a neighborhood that had seen an increase in burglaries, gang-related activity and beatings.
Police Chief Dave Scanlan said the barricades and police checkpoint were established in response to numerous requests from 12 Oaks residents. Many were from families who said they no longer felt safe allowing their children to visit the apartment complex's playground because of escalating crime and gangs, he said.
"We weren't targeting anyone individually, but were reacting to the crime rate spiking in that neighborhood," said Scanlan, referring to police records that he said showed 834 calls for service at 12 Oaks in 2008 compared with 627 calls in 2009.
"We were trying to get people to cooperate with police by locking their cars and apartments, and finding new ways to communicate with the residents," said Scanlan. "It had nothing to do with immigration or Hispanics."
City Manager Sarah Phillips described the police initiative two years ago as a way of enhancing communication with residents.
"We are here to provide services for everyone, immigrants, and non-immigrants," Phillips said.
The community's Latino population a decade ago was 19.2 percent, according to the 2000 census.
Officials declined to speculate on whether the 2010 census would show an increase. According to the Illinois District Report Card for 2009, 35.5 percent of the students at Kimball Hill Elementary School and 29 percent of students at Carl Sandburg Junior High School were designated as Hispanic.
Rafael Torres, 45, who works at a Schaumburg restaurant, described the 12 Oaks neighborhood as idyllic, offering plenty of green space for his sons to kick around a soccer ball, and excellent public schools.
"We don't have any problems with the police here," said Torres, who spent a recent morning planting seeds in a sunny patch of dirt outside his family's first-floor apartment. He said he hoped the family's fledgling garden will yield a bounty of cilantro, lettuce, tomatoes and watermelon.
The rent is $974 a month for a typical two-bedroom, one-bath unit and, although not cheap, remains affordable, Torres said.
His son, Marco, 18, a senior at Fremd High School in Palatine, plays on the 12 Oaks soccer league.
His kitchen job at a local restaurant has helped him keep busy, make new friends, and stay out of trouble, he said.
"I know some of the police officers around here, and they treat us right," said Marco Torres, who plans to attend culinary school after high school and dreams of opening his own restaurant in a Mexican Riviera resort town.
"My parents didn't have the opportunities when they were younger that I have," he said. "They were nice to take care of all of us, so someday I want to take care of them."

Full text: Treatment of water
It was on the day of my last visit to New Orleans, the location of my school, Loyola New Orleans, when the oil spill occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. Growing up and living in Chicago all of my life, I have always been aware of the dangers of combining toxins with water. It was only a few years ago that BP was dumping waste in Lake Michigan; now it has caused an oil slick that extends for thousands of square miles in the Gulf.
I wonder, is such poor treatment of our precious water inescapable?
Perhaps we could create more adequate responses to oil spills, or make corporations such as BP more accountable. But the reality is that if this problem is to be prevented from happening again, the problem must be directly targeted.
Offshore drilling must be banned and a charge for a clean-energy economy must be led by our president. Until these things are done, we cannot ensure that problems such as the oil spill in the Gulf will be prevented.
-- Lukas Cox, Evanston
Help needed
Katrina and the BP oil spill have convinced me the federal government is broken and in desperate need of repair.
-- Phil Adams, Lincolnshire
Energy policy
President Barack Obama is done! His recent speech from the Oval Office was a golden opportunity to regain control of the message about the ongoing devastation in the Gulf of Mexico. He should be wrenching authority from BP, which caused this disaster and which has usurped power in the area in order to stifle information about the extent of the disaster from reaching news sources.
It was also the perfect opportunity for our president to set our nation on a new course that will make us leaders in non-fossil fuel and non-nuclear alternative energy. There will never be a better opportunity for either.
Instead what we got were bland and unassertive hopes and talks.
Obama should toss bipartisanship and conciliation overboard and set forth a strong program of energy renewal with the accompanying appropriate public message. He seems to think that Nobel Prize winners and intellectuals will solve our problems if left to themselves. He needs to take an active role and exert a strong hand to guide policy.
-- Karen Wagner, Rolling Meadows
Oil addiction
Until there is more aggressive research and development and pursuit of alternative fuel sources, we have to shoulder part of the blame for the BP oil-rig disaster. Our seemingly incurable addiction to fossil fuels will continue to severely impact the environment, and oil companies will continue to realize tens of billions of dollars in profit.
-- Barry Flanagan, Highwood
Personal protest
I agree that if we want to protest the BP oil spill, the answer is not to boycott BP gas stations. Instead I plan on making my own personal BP protest by walking, cycling or taking public transit for at least one trip a week I would normally drive.
If we all went so far to substitute our driving for walking or cycling merely equal to our recommended daily exercise, we could collectively reduce U.S. dependence on oil.
So leave the car behind for one trip a week and help save the Gulf, relax and save money.
-- Jay Goldstein, Wilmette, board member, Active Transportation Alliance
Proper IDs
When a police officer walks into bar to start checking drinking ages, those with false IDs are fearful; those with proper IDs couldn't care less.
Illegal immigrants without IDs are fearful, while legal immigrants have nothing to worry about.
-- Joe Brouder, Prospect Heights
Abusive doctors
Thanks for the informative, albeit disturbing, article on doctors who are sexual abusers being able to retain their licenses to practice or to reapply for them after some disciplinary time ("Doctor. Sexual abuser. Or both. Convicted offenders don't lose medical licenses permanently; some escape discipline entirely," Page 1, June 20, by Tribune reporter Megan Twohey). How horrifying! This should not be.
I am going to bring this to the attention of my legislators, my congressman and our state's attorney. Some action must be taken to protect patients from such people.
I work with Chicagoland Voice of the Faithful, which is a lay organization determined to hold the Roman Catholic Church authorities accountable for their sexual abuse and/or enabling of abusive clergy remaining in place or being transferred to other parishes to be foisted on other unsuspecting people.
Just as clergy members must be held accountable for their crimes so, also, must doctors.
I am also a retired registered nurse. I am appalled that this practice continues.
-- Sandra Stilling Seehausen, Cary
Disconnected drivers
On a recent drive from Buffalo Grove to Old Orchard via the Edens Expressway, I noticed a lot of brake lights for no other reason than to slow down for a woman in the fast lane who was texting on her phone.
Then I noticed it again. And again.
To the dumb people with smart phones: If you're not going to stop breaking the law, then at least get into the far right lane before you stupidly cause an accident. You know who you are. And you're obviously not the sharpest knives in the drawer. Put the phone down -- and drive.
-- Faith Daytz, Buffalo Grove

Abstract: A rugged, 20,000-acre parcel of the original Irvine Ranch -- a pristine landscape of steep canyons, native grassland and sycamore woodland that is home to golden eagles, mountain lions and dozens of rare and endangered species of plants and animals -- became public property Tuesday in a historic deal with the developer who has sculpted the look of modern suburbia in Southern California.

Full text: A rugged, 20,000-acre parcel of the original Irvine Ranch -- a pristine landscape of steep canyons, native grassland and sycamore woodland that is home to golden eagles, mountain lions and dozens of rare and endangered species of plants and animals -- became public property Tuesday in a historic deal with the developer who has sculpted the look of modern suburbia in Southern California.
The open-space land, a gift from Donald Bren and the Irvine Co., was unanimously accepted by the Orange County Board of Supervisors, which also approved a long-term plan to manage the natural habitat, designated a National Natural Landmark four years ago. In one swoop, the size of parkland owned by the county grew by more than half.
The transfer of a large part of the historic ranch was an important milestone, placing the last major chunk of open private land in public hands and signaling the end of an era of enormous growth for Orange County.
It also was the culmination of an effort that Bren, a 78-year-old multibillionaire, launched more than three decades ago when he took control of the 94,000-acre Irvine Ranch, about a fifth of Orange County.
"It's been a long trail, these last 30 years, and this is a very significant event for us," Bren said in a rare interview after the handover.
He called the private-public partnership on open spaces a rare example of "social entrepreneurship," adding that "I'm proud of the people in the company who spent so much time with these community partnerships. I couldn't be more pleased. This is an investment in the future. It lives forever, and that is in fact a legacy."
Over the years, Bren's vision as a developer has transformed the Orange County landscape. His Irvine Co. created a retail, commercial and suburban juggernaut on 44,000 acres of the ranch, from the Newport coast to the city of Irvine, becoming, in the process, one of the world's largest and most-copied developers of planned communities.
But he also set aside 50,000 acres for parks, greenways and a recreational and wilderness preserve. More than half of that was previously donated to the public; the land given to the county Tuesday completes the transfer.
"I can't even begin to guess what the value of this property is. But in terms of its biological and geologic value, it is truly priceless," said Michael O'Connell, executive director of the Irvine Ranch Conservancy. "It's a world-class piece of land."
The conservancy, a nonprofit entity created by the Donald Bren Foundation, will continue to manage the land, under contract to the county's parks department.
The new county wilderness area extends from near the 91 Freeway south to the hills above Irvine, and parts of it are visible from both sides of the 241 toll road in eastern Orange County. It includes Loma Ridge, Laguna Laurel and Limestone Canyon, and plans are underway to create a new, 2,000-acre nature park, Black Star Canyon Regional Park, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest.
Nearly five times the size of Griffith Park, the land is essentially one large tract, which makes it important ecologically. It is part of what scientists call a Mediterranean climate zone, an area characterized by dry, mild weather and coastal fog that covers just 2% of the planet but contains 20% of all known plant species.
The land is a "truly magnificent, a globally important 'hotspot' of biological diversity," said Albert Bennett, dean of the School of Biological Sciences at UC Irvine. He said students and faculty travel the world to study similarly endowed open spaces "and these local lands rival many of those places in their diversity and biological importance."
Scientists also regard the tract as a geological treasure, and parts of it preserve a record of the last 80 million years of Earth history.
The parkland is rare among similarly sized natural habitats in the U.S. because it is so close to a highly urbanized area -- the land is within a half-hour drive of nearly 3 million people.
Much of the parkland is remote, though part of it has been accessible to the public in the past, through naturalist-led hikes and recreation days when visitors can go mountain biking and horseback riding. But access is limited, and the county says that is likely to continue as it develops long-term preservation plans.
"We want to create as many opportunities as possible for people to connect to the land and care about it," O'Connell said. "But not so much that they love it too much and threaten the values that make it so special."
When the Irvine Co. announced the wilderness gift last year, some environmentalists raised questions about whether the county had the financial resources to protect it.
The funding plan presented Tuesday by Mark Denny, director of Orange County Parks, includes $4 million from the Irvine Co. for management and capital improvements and $1 million for a research center at UC Irvine. The Nature Conservancy also is contributing $2 million.
Environmentalists welcomed the plan. Jean Watt, president of the nonprofit Friends of Harbors, Beaches and Parks, said the gift "lays the groundwork for a new era of cooperation."
The donation was the largest single transfer of private property to public ownership in Orange County history, increasing the county's parks and open-space protected land from 39,000 acres to more than 59,000 acres.
The Irvine Ranch got its name from James Irvine, an Irish immigrant who started a produce and grocery business in San Francisco during the Gold Rush and, with his partners, assembled the ranch from Spanish and Mexican land grants. His son, James Jr., inherited the ranch in 1892 and launched one of the state's earliest large-scale agricultural enterprises.
In 1897, the Irvine Co. made its first public land donation: 304 acres near Orange that is today known as Irvine Regional Park.
Bren, one of the last California land barons, took over the company with two partners in 1977. Two years later, they sold a discounted tract of land to the state to create Crystal Cove State Park.
After Bren bought out his partners, he began a more aggressive move to develop the ranch and, at the same time, began a process of large-scale land preservation aimed at creating wildlife corridors and protecting the natural habitat.
Growing up in Los Angeles, Bren frequently took advantage of California's open spaces, hiking and camping in the mountains. As an outdoorsman, he said, "I really appreciated nature."
His family had a beach home in Orange County, and since he moved there 50 years ago, he said, "I've seen Orange County grow and I've grown with it. And one of the great opportunities was to be part of this open-space preservation partnership with the ranch. I think it's really the monumental legacy for this company."

Full text: Officials in Arizona and Texas are clamoring for more National Guard protection to be deployed along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that their share of the planned 1,200 troops won't be enough to make a dent in illegal immigration.
After a meeting with Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, officials with the Obama administration announced that Arizona would receive a sizable share of the troops, 524. That is more than double the number allocated to any of the other three border states, even though Arizona abuts only about 17% of the U.S.-Mexican border.
By comparison, Texas is set to receive 250 guard troops, even though it has 60% of the 1,969-mile border. California will receive 224 and New Mexico 72, the administration announced. The remaining troops would report to a national liaison office.
Texas and Arizona, both led by Republican governors, immediately complained about their allocations. "Obviously, that is not sufficient to secure the border," said Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Texas Gov. Rick Perry. "We're going to continue to urge the federal government to provide the resources we need."
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer expressed similar concern and said that the 524 troops were not what she had hoped she would receive.
Tensions have already been high between Ms. Brewer and the Obama administration after the governor signed a law requiring police who are enforcing other laws to check the immigration status of anyone they suspect of being in the country illegally. The Obama administration has threatened to sue Arizona over the law.
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs responded to complaints from the governors by saying the administration's effort to secure the border has been extraordinary. "The president has made a big commitment to securing the border," he said Tuesday. President Obama is expected to make a speech on immigration laws on Thursday.
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, struck more conciliatory tones. Mr. Schwarzenegger, in a statement, applauded President Obama for sending the additional troops. However, he too said he would "continue to urge the federal government to provide more National Guard personnel for our border."
Mr. Richardson's office called the Obama administration announcement a good first step.
Texas and Arizona say that crime is high along their borders and there is an imminent need for amped-up security.
The sector of the boarder that includes Tucson, Ariz., had more arrests of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the border than any other sector, with 241,000 in 2009, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The next closest was the San Diego sector with 119,000 arrests. Still, the arrests in the Tucson sector in 2009 were down 36% from 2007.
Leaders of Texas and Arizona are pinning hopes for increased patrols on federal legislation sponsored by Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain that would bring 3,000 troops to each of their respective borders.
"Those numbers are more in line with what is usually estimated as needed to secure the border," said Fred Burton, a former special agent with the state department and a vice president of intelligence at Stratfor, a global intelligence company.
A similar bill in May failed to garner the necessary 60 votes in the Senate to clear procedural hurdles. But Sen. McCain is more hopeful that this amendment will pass. The amendment, co-sponsored by Texas's Senate delegation and Jon Kyl of Arizona, all Republicans, has already passed out of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
All states have the authority to call up their own National Guard troops but would have to pay for them at a time when many face extreme budget pressures. If the troops are called up by the president, the cost is borne by federal tax dollars.
Neither California nor New Mexico stands to receive troops from the passage of the bill.

Abstract: Hayhanen and Abel were illegals but not deep-penetration sleeper agents. [...] the FBI's arrest of 10 Russian sleeper agents on U.S. soil has no precedent in Cold War history, even if fans of Walter Wager's novel "Telefon" (later a movie staring Charles Bronson) find it familiar.

Full text: The Justice Department's arrest this week of 10 Russian spies posing as American citizens is not stranger than fiction; it mirrors fiction. Innumerable Cold War novels and films focused on "sleeper agents," professional Soviet espionage officers superbly trained in language and culture who take on the identity of a native-born American to gain access to U.S. intelligence and policy making.
But in reality the most damaging Cold War spies were native-born Americans -- Julius Rosenberg, Alger Hiss, Aldrich Ames, Richard Hansen -- who for reasons of ideology, money or psychological perversity chose to betray their country.
Most Soviet espionage was supervised by "legal" KGB officers operating under official cover as diplomats who, when arrested, faced only expulsion, protected by their diplomatic status. Great Britain famously expelled 105 Soviet personnel linked to KGB intelligence in 1971. But none of them had been posing as a British citizen. The KGB also had "illegal" officers who had no diplomatic status, often used false identities and who usually functioned as covert liaisons with native-born traitors. Long-term sleeper agents, as these 10 appear to have been, are rare.
In the late-1950s, the U.S. government arrested, tried and convicted five Soviet illegals in connection with the Soble-Soblen spy ring: Jack Soble, his wife Myra, his brother Robert Soblen (the two brothers had anglicized their Lithuanian name, Sobolevicius, slightly differently), Jacob Albam and Mark Zborowski. None had diplomatic cover, but neither were they "deep penetration" agents. All used their true identities, simply pretending to be innocent immigrants.
Moreover, their espionage work was confined largely to "agent handling," i.e., acting as liaison with native-born Americans, mostly Communists, who had been recruited as Soviet spies years earlier. Their major accomplishment was to infiltrate the American Trotskyist movement and the Russian emigre community, targets with no direct connection to the U.S. government. Soble and associates had no plans or prospects of entering American think tanks or other institutions with access to high-level American policy makers.
There were two Soviet illegals exposed in the late 1950s whose activities came a bit closer to the recently arrested 10. An illegal officer, KGB Col. Rudolf Abel (real name Vilyam Fisher), entered the U.S. in 1948 and operated under a variety of false identities. He was finally exposed when his assistant and fellow illegal, KGB Lt. Col. Reino Hayhanen, defected in 1957. (Hayhanen, of Finnish background, had been sent to the U.S. using false papers identifying him as an American of Finnish ancestry.) Abel, who never admitted his real name, was convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison.
After only five years he was freed in exchange for Francis Gary Powers, the U-2 pilot shot down over the Soviet Union on a CIA reconnaissance mission. While Hayhanen and Abel assumed false identities as Americans, their function was to maintain contact and pick up information from native-born Americans who spied for the Soviets. Abel's initial task, for example, was to re-establish KGB contact with Theodore Hall, an American physicist and secret Communist who had provided U.S. atomic secrets to the USSR while working at Los Alamos. Hayhanen and Abel were illegals but not deep-penetration sleeper agents.
Thus, the FBI's arrest of 10 Russian sleeper agents on U.S. soil has no precedent in Cold War history, even if fans of Walter Wager's novel "Telefon" (later a movie staring Charles Bronson) find it familiar. Also unprecedented, and reassuringly so, is that FBI counterintelligence had identified these Russian sleepers early on, had been monitoring them for years, and finally decided that it had gained what it could from such surveillance and rolled up the Russian networks.
Deep-penetration agents are a very, very expensive investment. Not only the training of the professional officers themselves, but covertly supporting them, communicating with them, and supervising their activities is a major bureaucratic expense for any intelligence agency. The loss of 10 such agents and the resulting collateral damage makes this a catastrophe for Russian foreign intelligence. The FBI also identified a number of Russian "legal" officers who made surreptitious contact with the sleepers and, thus exposed, these Russian officers are now useless for intelligence fieldwork.
The SVR-- Russian Foreign Intelligence, successor to the KGB -- also cannot be sure that the FBI has disclosed all that it knows of the 10 agents' activities (11 with the arrest of a confederate in Cyprus). Prudence dictates that the SVR must assume that any other Russian officers who had covert contact with the 11 may have been identified by American security. Use of these potentially compromised officers in future espionage field-work would be risky and foolish.
Will any of the 10 talk to avoid a long prison term? Rudolf Abel was defiant and refused any cooperation. Jack Soble, however, dodged the death penalty by fully confessing, telling all he knew of KGB operations in the U.S. and Western Europe, and even testified against his brother. These 10 (or 11, if we count the agent arrested in Cyprus) don't face the death penalty but do face potentially long terms in prison, and there aren't any Francis Gary Powers available for exchanges.

Full text: Week after week, columnist Vicky Pelaez hammered away at U.S. policy in the pages of a New York City newspaper.
"The essence of capitalism is exploitation and permanent expansion to ensure profit growth and the power of mega-corporations. . .," Ms. Pelaez, a native of Peru, wrote in a 2007 column for El Diario La Prensa, a Spanish-language daily.
Anna Chapman seemed to have a different view of an immigrant's life in New York. In an interview posted on YouTube, Ms. Chapman compared the U.S. to her native Russia. "Here, meeting the most successful people is easier than anywhere else in the world. If in Moscow it's practically impossible . . . then in New York everything is different," she said. "You can go to dinner with your neighbor and . . . meet the most important venture capitalist tonight."
The two women did share one goal, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation: They were among 11 defendants working as "deep cover" Russian agents, sent to the U.S. to assume fake identities and "develop ties in policymaking circles." All have been charged with conspiracy to act as unauthorized agents of foreign governments. Nine are also charged with conspiracy to launder money. Of the five defendants arrested in the New York area, the men are being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, and the women at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.
The suspects lived in areas across the country, from Boston to Seattle, with five of them settling in the New York area. Their alleged schemes took place in the most public of places: a Times Square coffee shop, a Long Island Rail Road station in Queens, a downtown bookstore.
The espionage tale stunned those who knew the New York suspects. Ms. Pelaez's family, colleagues and lawyer said the case against her was thin. Her husband, Juan Lazaro, also was among the accused.
In an interview Tuesday outside the couple's home, Waldo Mariscal said his mother and stepfather have no ties to Russia and have never visited the country, he said. "It's preposterous," said Mr. Mariscal, an architect.
Ms. Pelaez arrived in the U.S. more than 20 years ago; earlier, while working in Peru as a TV reporter, she was kidnapped. Her husband, Mr. Lazaro, taught a Latin American class at Baruch University. Neighbors noted summer barbecues with South American music.
Mr. Lazaro claimed to be a Peruvian citizen born in Uruguay, according to the complaint. But in 2002, federal agents heard him at home talking about his childhood with Ms. Pelaez. He told her: "We moved to Siberia . . . as soon as the war started," the complaint says.
Colleagues describe Ms. Pelaez as an opinionated columnist with a flair for painting, a love of ceviche and pride in her teenage son's piano skills.
"She dedicated so much time to her painting and El Diario I don't know how she could find time to spy," said Candida Portugues, a reporter at El Diario La Prensa. "She did all kinds of stuff. I don't know. It's very difficult for me to believe this."
Ms. Chapman's lawyer voiced similar disbelief. Ms. Chapman is a 28-year-old divorced Russian national who moved to the U.S. full-time last year. "This is a . . . very intelligent woman," said lawyer Robert Baum. "She has a master's in economics, she speaks fluently several languages and she ran her own real-estate company through the Internet, which was a very lucrative and successful business. She doesn't fit the profile of a spy that they make her out to be."
It was Ms. Chapman who met last Saturday with an undercover FBI agent posing as a Russian embassy official, according to the complaint.
Two other suspects, Richard and Cynthia Murphy of Montclair, N.J., were also described as blending into their suburban lifestyles. The couple moved to the U.S. in the mid-1990s.
Mrs. Murphy has worked at Morea Financial Services in Manhattan for 13 years and is currently a vice president, conducting "comprehensive Financial Planning and Tax Accounting services for high net-worth individuals," according to a profile on the business networking site LinkedIn. She received an MBA from Columbia Business School last month.
The 55-page complaint reads like a Cold War spy thriller. For example, it says Ms. Pelaez was caught on video accepting a bag from an individual in a park in a South American country in 2000. She was also allegedly overheard by FBI agents on several occasions discussing with her husband the transactions, which involved large amounts of money, and instructing him to pass a note to a presumed Russian agent in invisible ink, according to the complaint.
"Who knows what she's doing, who she's talking to?" her attorney, John M. Rodriguez, said of the meeting in the park. "I don't know if any money exchanged hands or not. . . . And I suspect the U.S. government has no way of knowing either."
Mr. Rodriguez said that Ms. Pelaez wasn't concealing her identity, unlike some of the other defendants, and that her relationship with Mr. Lazaro dates back 30 years, prior to the alleged conspiracy with Russia. He said they'd been married for 17 years. While she may be "leftist leaning," he said, that does not make her a spy.

Mr. Soros, the 84-year-old older brother of hedge-fund manager George Soros and a former athlete, first arrived in Manhattan with a pittance, having defected while traveling to Switzerland with the 1948 Hungarian Olympic ski team.
He saw that trip as his chance to escape his Communist-controlled homeland after World War II, he says.
That first year in New York planted the seed for what would become the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans.
Mr. Soros wanted to study engineering in a top graduate program, but he couldn't afford Ivy League schools. Instead he chose the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, struggling to pay for meals and cheap housing near Prospect Park.
Mr. Soros's master's degree from Brooklyn served him well: He went on to run a global engineering firm and eventually owned interests in shipping concerns. Mr. Soros in the 1980s and 1990s also helped his brother George's firm select industrial investments for the famous Quantum family of funds.
Still, Paul Soros never forgot arriving in the U.S. with boundless educational ambitions but limited options.
In 1998, when the Soroses were considering how to distribute their endowment, which started with $50 million, Mr. Soros wanted to focus on lightening the burden for immigrants and children of immigrants aiming to pursue graduate degrees.
"We didn't know how to start," the 80-year-old Mrs. Soros says.
"Having a building with our name on it doesn't appeal to me," Mr. Soros says.
Soros fellowship recipients must demonstrate an original idea or talent; they must have accomplished something requiring a sustained effort; and they must have participated in government or another forum dedicated to freedoms prescribed in the U.S. Bill of Rights.
Each year, 30 fellows receive up to $90,000 to help cover two years of tuition and other educational and living expenses, to study any subject at any U.S. university. Mr. Soros says he and his wife increased the endowment to recognize more contributions by immigrants to business, arts, science, education, government, courts, nonprofits and other areas, amid efforts they view as increasingly anti-immigrant.
Soros fellowship recipients from the past 12 years have gone on to start companies, compose celebrated works of music, serve as lawyers in the White House, teach political science and help develop new medicines.
Mrs. Soros is chairman of the endowment. Mr. Soros remains involved in key decisions. However, his health limits his day-to-day involvement, since he has Parkinson's disease and diabetes and has been treated for jaw and tongue cancer, which are in remission. The Soroses' son Jeffrey became president of the fellowship this year, and their son Peter helps oversee investments. The endowment is primarily invested in Soros Fund Management's Quantum funds, according to Mr. Soros.

Full text: In a surprise move, President Barack Obama is making a renewed push to pass an immigration overhaul, possibly during a lame-duck session of Congress after the November elections.
Obama met Tuesday with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in the State Dining Room and discussed strategy for passing a bill that had seemed dead for the year.
The president will put the immigration issue squarely before the public in a speech Thursday at American University in which he will make the case for a bill that provides a path to legal status for the estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally.
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said at his daily briefing Tuesday that "this continues to be a very important national issue" that requires Republican support. To date, no GOP senators have agreed to back a comprehensive immigration bill. Nor has an immigration bill been introduced in the Senate. Obama will emphasize that "he cannot do this alone," Gibbs said.
As recently as May, Obama said he merely wanted to "begin work" on immigration this year -- not complete a bill. But this week he has approached the issue with renewed urgency. He spoke to immigration advocates at the White House on Monday, setting aside time even while coping with the oil spill and a shake-up in the military command in Afghanistan.
Latino lawmakers who have criticized the White House for neglecting immigration said they are pleased to see Obama redoubling his efforts.
Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., who was in the Tuesday meeting with Obama, said in an interview: "He's going to speak to the nation on Thursday and tell the country why it's important to have comprehensive immigration reform. That's something we've been demanding of this administration."
Lawmakers and the president debated ways to pass legislation in the coming months -- no small task given that members also will be focused on re-election bids. As proponents see it, voting on an immigration bill in the lame-duck session has one major advantage: Without another election to worry about, departing lawmakers may have less reason to fear a vote on a controversial issue that tends to polarize voters.

Abstract: In their hourlong meeting Tuesday, lawmakers and the president debated a strategy for passing a bill in the coming months -- no small task given that members are increasingly focused on the upcoming election, and national polls show broad support for Arizona's strict new immigration law. In another move likely to please Latino voters, Obama's immigration enforcement chief, John Morton, issued a memo Tuesday ordering his agency to focus on deporting criminals and those who pose a national security threat, rather than on pursuing people such as "immediate family members of U.S. citizens" and those caring for children.

Full text: It would be a revival worthy of Lazarus, but President Obama is making a renewed push for an immigration overhaul, possibly during a lame-duck session of Congress after the November election -- when members would no longer face an imminent political risk for supporting it.
Obama met with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in the State Dining Room on Tuesday and discussed a strategy for passing a bill that had seemed dead for the year.
On Thursday morning, the president will put the issue before the American public. In a speech at American University, he plans to make the case for providing a path to legal status for the estimated 11 million people who live in the U.S. illegally while strengthening border enforcement.
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said at his daily briefing Tuesday that "this continues to be a very important national issue" requiring Republican support. To date, no Republican senators have agreed to back a comprehensive immigration bill. Nor has such a bill been introduced in the Senate.
Obama "can't sign something that doesn't exist," said one person who was at the White House meeting.
As recently as May, Obama said he merely wanted to "begin work" on immigration this year -- not complete a bill. But this week he has approached the issue with renewed urgency.
He spoke to immigration advocates at the White House on Monday, setting aside time from coping with the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and a shakeup in his military command in Afghanistan.
Latino lawmakers who have criticized the White House for neglecting immigration said they were pleased.
Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-Ill.), who was part of the Hispanic Caucus meeting with Obama, said in an interview: "He's going to speak to the nation on Thursday and tell the country why it's important to have comprehensive immigration reform. That's something we've been demanding of this administration."
But advocates have heard assurances before.
Deepak Bhargava of the Washington-based Center for Community Change was among those who met with the president Monday. In an interview afterward, Bhargava said Obama "was unambiguous about his commitment. The question is whether the actions will match the words over the next few weeks."
In their hourlong meeting Tuesday, lawmakers and the president debated a strategy for passing a bill in the coming months -- no small task given that members are increasingly focused on the upcoming election, and national polls show broad support for Arizona's strict new immigration law.
With conservatives energized, angry and likely to storm to the polls, Democrats fear they will lose even more seats in Congress than a president's party typically does at the halfway point in his term.
Voting on an immigration bill in a lame-duck session has some advantages in proponents' eyes. Outgoing members of Congress would have little reason to fear backing a controversial bill. And those who won might be more likely to support it, since they wouldn't have to face voters for another two years -- when Obama is up for reelection and likely to draw progressives to the polls.
In addition, if Republicans make major gains in November, an immigration overhaul could be impossible in 2011 or 2012.
While running for president, Obama pledged to act on immigration in 2009. That deadline came and went. But Obama won two-thirds of the Latino vote in 2008 and has no wish to alienate a growing constituency.
Raising the issue anew allows Obama to mollify his Latino supporters. But it also puts Republicans in a tough spot. Neither party can afford to write off a Latino community whose influence is growing.
Forcing a vote on immigration would give Republicans a difficult choice: They could vote against the bill and risk antagonizing Latinos, or vote yes and invite the wrath of "tea party" activists and other conservatives opposed to what they view as amnesty for illegal immigrants.
In his private meetings this week, Obama has emphasized that Republicans are the main force blocking a bill.
"He said over and over again the Republican obstruction was the key to preventing this from getting done," said Eliseo Medina, international executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, who took part in a meeting with Obama on Monday.
In another move likely to please Latino voters, Obama's immigration enforcement chief, John Morton, issued a memo Tuesday ordering his agency to focus on deporting criminals and those who pose a national security threat, rather than on pursuing people such as "immediate family members of U.S. citizens" and those caring for children.
Morton has long embraced those priorities publicly. The memo was an effort to make them clear to every employee of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said a senior ICE official who was not authorized to speak publicly.
The Times has reported in recent months on deportation cases against college students and others with no criminal records, including one against a Nevada couple that a federal judge criticized as "horrific."
After the article appeared, immigration officials told the family it would not be deported.
Officials in the Department of Homeland Security, which encompasses ICE, say it is difficult for senior officials to learn of every such case wending its way through the sprawling bureaucracy.
The Morton memo orders immigration officials to focus on removing "aliens engaged in or suspected of terrorism or espionage, or who otherwise pose a danger to national security; aliens convicted of crimes, with a particular emphasis on violent criminals, felons and repeat offenders; aliens not younger than 16 years of age who participated in organized criminal gangs; aliens subject to outstanding criminal warrants; and aliens who otherwise pose a serious risk to public safety."

In an ongoing fight against intellectual piracy, federal authorities seized the domain names of nine websites accused of letting users watch on-demand versions of first-run movies.
Referring to the sites as "among the most popular" websites for distributing illegal copies of movies, the government highlighted copies of films currently in theaters, such as "Toy Story 3" and "The A-Team," for evidence to obtain the warrant.
The nine sites had registered their domain names via U.S.-based registration services, allowing authorities to take control of their site addresses. Some were run on computers based in the U.S.--in Colorado, Florida and Illinois. But others used computers based in Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the Czech Republic.
At a Wednesday news conference in Burbank, Calif., the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency said authorities had seized some assets, funds and equipment, and had executed four search warrants at U.S. residences.
Citing an ongoing investigation, they declined to offer further specifics or say whether they had many any arrests.
ICE Assistant Secretary John Morton acknowledged that some of the foreign-based websites could reappear at different addresses.
Mr. Morton said at the news conference that on June 15 alone, 37,000 people had watched "Sex and the City 2" on one of the sites, TVShack.net.
The other sites include Movies-Links.tv, Filespump.com, ZML.com, Now-Movies.com, ThePirateCity.org, PlanetMoviez.com, NinjaVideo.net and NinjaThis.net.
Attempts to contact the websites weren't immediately successful.
Unlike most other antipirating efforts, the focus in this crackdown wasn't on downloads. Rather, many of the sites let users "stream" movies free, and supported themselves by selling advertising. While that's a similar model to legitimate video-watching sites, such as Hulu.com, the sites targeted by the enforcement action had no licenses to show the movies, and didn't pay the studios that created them.
The government pointed to TVShack.net's attempt to cool off users upset with slow loading times for the movies:
"[P]lease keep in mind that you're watching videos for free as opposed to spending over 20 dollars at the [movie] theater or purchasing a show," an affidavit quoted TVShack as saying. "This should help you put things in perspective."
Visitors to the web pages will be redirected to a page that notifies them the sites have been seized by the government.
Mr. Morton and several movie-studio executives sought to portray online piracy as harmful to America's economic interests, saying that Hollywood employs 2.5 million Americans in 50 states.
"Counterfeiting and piracy hurt American workers, pure and simple," Mr. Morton said.
"These are good, middle-class jobs," added Thom Davis, a vice president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, a movie-industry workers' union.
Movie studios, artists and media companies have long battled illegal file-sharing and piracy sites with a variety of legal tactics over the years.
Most recently, the producers of "The Hurt Locker" sued 5,000 people who downloaded the Oscar winning war movie from BitTorrent networks.
Asked whether ICE would similarly go after individuals, Mr. Morton said: "Right now our focus is on the sites themselves."
Mr. Morton acknowledged that when it comes to online distribution technologies like BitTorrent that do not store copies of media centrally, authorities may have a difficult time taking steps like the ones announced Wednesday. "It's a challenge," he said. "There's a level of sophistication government can't always match."
"I don't think we've stopped Internet piracy in a day," Mr. Morton said. "But this is going to be a sustained effort."
Wednesday's announcement was part of a broader effort to crack down on other forms of piracy and counterfeiting, such as pharmaceuticals. The initiative is being run by the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, an interagency task force spearheaded by ICE and including representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Food and Drug Administration and six others.

Full text: Author: Martin Neil Baily, Matthew J. Slaughter; Laura D'Andrea Tyson
For generations, coal miners gauged the health of their workplace with a critical indicator: canaries. Any buildup of carbon monoxide and other gases would silence the singing canaries before reaching levels toxic to humans.
Today, another leading indicator--multinational companies headquartered in the U.S.--is signaling widespread and legitimate concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. A new that the three of us advised argues that all Americans should heed their message.
U.S. multinational companies have long been among America's strongest firms. Although they comprise far less than 1% of U.S. companies, they account for about 19% of all private jobs, 25% of all private wages, 48% of total exports of goods, and a remarkable 74% of nonpublic R&D spending. For decades, U.S. multinationals have driven an outsized share of U.S. productivity growth, the foundation of rising standards of living for everyone. They are responsible for 41% of the increase in private labor productivity since 1990.
Despite the common allegation that multinationals simply "export jobs" out of the U.S., research shows that expansion abroad by these firms has tended to complement--not substitute for--their U.S. operations. More investment and employment abroad have tended to create more American investment and jobs as well. From 1988 to 2007, employment in foreign affiliates rose to 10 million from 4.8 million. During that same period, employment in U.S. parent companies rose to 22 million from 17.7 million.
But there is no guarantee that the past will be prologue. McKinsey conducted in-depth interviews with senior executives from 26 of America's largest and best-known multinationals. Their message is sobering: Today the U.S. is in an era of global competition to attract, retain and grow the operations of multinational companies that it's never faced before.
These leading executives laud many longstanding economic strengths of the U.S., such as its large and competitive domestic market. But they also see dozens of other countries--and not just fast-growing economies such as Brazil, Russia, India and China--making dramatic improvements in the policies and overall economic environment they present to the world's leading companies. These improvements are not simply a matter of tax holidays and other financial subsidies. Rather, these countries have opened their markets broadly, and they are redefining where U.S. multinationals can successfully operate.
All of the business leaders interviewed for this study agreed that U.S. tax policy has a "major impact" on their competitiveness and investment decisions, and most said that policies like limits on skilled immigration handicap their companies. In the words of one executive, tax considerations are "often one of the largest line items in the investment projection." Moreover, many of these leaders voiced concern about the future ability of this country to attract and grow corporate investment, R&D and jobs. U.S. multinationals will not aggressively invest and hire here at home if they can't realize attractive returns from doing so.
It is our strong belief that their concerns must be taken seriously by U.S. policy makers at all levels. We aren't saying that America's economic policy should be driven by the considerations of U.S. multinational firms alone--far from it. But when millions of American workers are facing severe hardship, driving our strongest companies with the best-paying jobs overseas certainly won't help. Lawmakers must acknowledge the outsized contributions multinationals have made to America's economic strength.
The world and the options it presents to global firms have changed dramatically in recent years; the U.S. cannot rest on past success and take its multinationals for granted. Policy makers must partner with business leaders to craft policies aimed at sustaining an environment in which U.S. multinationals can thrive. If they don't, going forward we all should expect smaller contributions to the U.S. economy by less vibrant U.S. multinationals: less R&D, less investment, fewer exports and fewer jobs.
There are several deep challenges now facing the U.S. economy in the wake of the financial crisis. Perhaps most importantly, U.S. companies have yet to resume vigorous job creation. Peak to trough thus far, the U.S. economy has lost 8.5 million private payroll jobs--down to 107.1 million in December 2009 from 115.6 million December 2007. In the past five months, the U.S. has regained only 495,000 private jobs--and more than a third are temporary. In addition to creating more jobs, America's economy needs to be rebalanced away from consumption and towards capital investment and exports.
U.S. multinationals are uniquely positioned to help America meet these challenges. But this will require far-sighted policy initiatives like liberalizing trade and protecting intellectual property.
These firms are now the canaries in the U.S. economic coal mine. Will our lawmakers pay attention?

Full text: The guy sitting next to me on a plane told me he is an accent expert. I can tell where you're from by how you speak, he said.
"OK," I told him. "Where am I from?"
I talked a little bit longer. Looking baffled, he said: "Gosh, I don't know. You have a perfect American accent."
"I'm from Singapore," I told him, much to his surprise. I was born in Hong Kong and lived in Taiwan for four years before spending the next 14 in Singapore. Even though I spent the first 18 years of my life in Asia, I am an American. I am a product of globalization.
When American companies establish offices abroad, they often relocate American families to cities around the world -- Cairo, London, Tokyo, Singapore. Expatriate communities form around these transplanted families, including American schools staffed by American teachers.
My dad, who is from Hong Kong, worked for an American company in Asia. The company relocated my father and paid for me to attend an American school. Singapore American School, which I attended for 12 years, has 3,200 children enrolled, most of whom are American expats.
In kindergarten, I read "Green Eggs and Ham." I learned to count in nickels, dimes and quarters. In eighth grade I studied Thomas Jefferson and the Civil War and attended the awkward middle school dances of American lore. By the time I was 12, I had a full-on American accent and a set of American values preached to me by American teachers, though I had never set foot in the country.
My own, very Cantonese family, had taken to calling me a "guai lo," a derogatory term for white person. They were confused as to what was happening to me. I scored a five on my AP U.S. history exam. I knew very little about Asian history.
There are no national or regional boundaries to American culture, and its value set is incredibly inclusive. It preaches hard work, achievement, over-consumption, faith and the belief that anyone can achieve anything. Add the international institutions set up abroad, and globalization means you don't need to set foot in America to be an American. And I fully bought into it.
With 12 years of U.S. education behind me, I wanted to attend an American university. So here I am, a recent journalism graduate from Northwestern, having invested in free speech, even though my own country's government doesn't believe in it.
But now, America is going to have to deal with me. More specifically, America's immigration officers. Because even though America's cultural borders are amorphous, its national boundaries are not. I'm American, but that doesn't mean anything unless it's on paper.
American immigration involves jumping through hoops, but you're only allowed to even try jumping once you win the lottery. Navigating terms such as F-1, OPT, H-1B and TN is a daily ritual.
America, you created me. I am your citizen, whether you like it or not.

Full text: In the final scene of "Zoot Suit," the Luis Valdez play about the 1942 Sleepy Lagoon murder trial in Los Angeles, the character Smiley directs the following line to fellow Mexican American Hank Reyna after the unfairly accused men are released from prison:
"Let's face it, Hank. There's no life for us in this city, I'm taking my family and I'm moving to Arizona."
In Mexico City, where "Zoot Suit" is playing, audiences have erupted in applause and laughter in response to the line in light of the controversial illegal immigration law recently enacted in Arizona. Smiley's optimism about life there sounds like a gag squeezed into the dialogue at the last minute.
But it is not. The line is actually in Valdez's original 1978 script.
Speaking in Mexico City after the opening of the production here, Valdez can't help but feel good about the serendipity of the moment. "Critics ask me, 'What makes your play relevant after 30 years?' And now the response I get is, 'How come your play is so fresh?' "
But it is a somewhat bitter acknowledgment, he said. "The situation has changed and not changed in the United States. In some ways it's better, in some ways it's worse."
Thirty-two years after "Zoot Suit" premiered at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, becoming a box-office blockbuster before eventually reaching Broadway and the silver screen, the play has migrated south of the border in a new full production by Mexico's National Theater Company.
Performances of "Zoot Suit" have sold out almost consistently since the play opened April 29 on the campus of the national university, theater officials said.
Its run ends Sunday.
The production is significant on several levels. It is the first "Zoot Suit" mounted in Mexico and has an all-Mexican cast and all-Mexican production team. It is also the first production of "Zoot Suit" in Spanish, with a script co-translated by Valdez and Edna Ochoa, a writer and academic in Texas. Valdez also cast and directed the production.
"Zoot Suit" follows Reyna and his alter-ego, El Pachuco, during the sensationalized Sleepy Lagoon trial, World War II and the so-called Zoot suit riots that followed the court proceedings. In Mexico, the story is bolstering the widely held perception that Mexicans in the United States are still subjected to discrimination.
"It shows us something that really happened, and at the same time, [that] history keeps repeating itself and repeating itself," said audience member Fabiola Zepeda, 22, after a recent performance.
The Mexican theater press has given the play a similar reading.
"This production maintains its permanence in light of recent events in Arizona," said the online magazine Interescena. " 'Zoot Suit' displays a permanent process in the United States, where the abuse of 'the other' never disappears."
But the play's staging in Mexico City also sends a triumphant signal, many here said. A "Zoot Suit" production in Mexico is a sign that Mexican American culture is entering the heart of a society that for generations has been unsure of how to regard its descendants from the "north."
The National Autonomous University of Mexico hosted a symposium last week on these very issues, with participants discussing topics such as immigration, Valdez's legacy in the U.S. theater, and "The Chicano in the Mexican Consciousness," as one panel was called.
In Mexico, growing awareness of Los Angeles as a cultural center with strong ties to the country is a recent development. Los Angeles was among those invited to the Mexico City book fair in 2006 and to the international book festival in Guadalajara, the largest in the Spanish-speaking world, last year.
In 2008, the Tamayo Museum in Mexico City hosted "Phantom Sightings," the art survey of recent conceptual work by Mexican American artists, an exhibit that originated at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
One panelist at the "Zoot Suit" symposium here, independent U.S. scholar Tomas Ybarra-Frausto, said before a recent performance that perceptions of Mexican Americans within Mexico have shifted radically due to more fluid cultural movement between the two countries.
"When I came here 20 years ago, I got on the front pages for saying 'Every Mexican has the potential to be a Chicano,' " Ybarra-Frausto said. "But look now. We're here, they're there. They're here, we're there."
The genesis of this "Zoot Suit" production lies with Alma Martinez, a professor at Pomona College and member of the original "Zoot Suit" cast.
One of Valdez's longtime collaborators, Martinez made contact last year with the new artistic director of Mexico's National Theater Company, Luis de Tavira, to float the idea of a "Zoot Suit" staging in Mexico. Martinez, a Mexican native, had studied theater with De Tavira and is in the current production as Reyna's mother.
De Tavira expressed immediate interest, and the wheels began turning for a full staging in Spanish. It's no easy task in any language. "Zoot Suit" requires a large, physically agile cast, with many roles requiring singing or dancing in genres such as mambo and swing.
The play also serves as a milestone on a long journey for Luis Valdez, now 70. The playwright, director and filmmaker is a native of California's Central Valley and founder of the Teatro Campesino, the agitprop performance arm of the United Farm Workers movement led by Cesar Chavez.
Valdez still expresses indignation over what he calls a "lockout" of a "Zoot Suit" revival in Los Angeles. (He directed the film version of "Zoot Suit" in 1981 and the biopic of musician Ritchie Valens, "La Bamba," in 1986, but he has not made a major studio-produced film since.)
"They really ignore what's going on in the Latino theater," Valdez said.
Yet in Mexico he is referred to as "maestro," a term of deep respect that is not used lightly. Staging his play in Mexico City, Valdez said, and watching it unfold in Spanish, is particularly moving for him.
"I feel it's more real than the English version. As a Chicano, I feel the characters are more real, the pachucos are more real, in their interactions."
Bringing "Zoot Suit" here is a sort of homecoming, the playwright said. Valdez first visited Mexico City in 1963, while studying for a theater degree at San Jose State.
"I had this weird sensation that here I was in Mexico, and I saw faces all around me that looked familiar, looked like relatives, but I knew no one, and no one knew me," Valdez said. "They were all busy, going about their lives, rushing about, talking in Spanish. And so it was very odd."
Yet, "I knew that I would come back in some way, shape, or form."

Full text: Adding some swashbuckling to its tough talk on fighting piracy, the federal government on Wednesday seized several websites that had offered downloads of pirated movies such as "Toy Story 3" and "Iron Man 2" within hours of their release in theaters.
Federal authorities announced that they had seized domain names from nine websites engaged in the "criminal theft of American movies and television." The websites include TVShack.net, PlanetMoviez.com, ThePirateCity.org and Ninjavideo.net. Combined, the sites drew 6.7 million visitors a month, authorities said.
Officials also seized assets from 15 bank, investment and advertising accounts and executed residential search warrants in North Carolina, New York, New Jersey and Washington, according to a statement from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which coordinated its investigation with the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies.
The crackdown, which involved 100 agents working in 11 states and the Netherlands, was part of a renewed campaign dubbed Operation in Our Sites by federal authorities to curb Internet counterfeiting and piracy.
The announcement comes a week after the Obama administration unveiled a detailed plan on how to tackle global piracy, including targeting illegal websites.
ICE Assistant Secretary John Morton, speaking at a Walt Disney Studios sound stage where he was joined by movie studio executives and union representatives, trumpeted the bust as the beginning of a "long-term effort to turn the tables on these thieves."
The studios say they lose hundreds of millions annually to piracy.
Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement that the actions were necessary to protect the jobs and livelihoods of "ordinary working people" and warned others engaged in similar websites.
"If your business model is piracy, your story will not have a happy ending," Bharara said.

Full text: Production resumed Wednesday at a manufacturing plant in Fullerton after an immigration raid that resulted in the arrests of 43 workers and the temporary shutdown of the facility.
Employers at Terra Universal Inc., which produces equipment for semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturers, spent the day reassuring customers, checking employees' documents and questioning why they were targeted, according to the company's attorney.
Chief Operating Officer Ken Harms said the raid took him by surprise and disrupted the entire plant. "It was completely unexpected," he said.
Immigration agents executed a search warrant at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday as part of an ongoing criminal investigation, according to Lori Haley, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Haley declined to specify what agents were investigating but said the operation was conducted in a professional manner.
"We are not there to cause disruption to the company," she said. "We are there to gather evidence."
Terra Universal, which opened in 1976, has about 230 employees. Haley said all but two of the workers arrested were later released and given notices to appear in immigration court.
According to the search warrant, agents were looking for job applications, employment verification forms, immigration documents and correspondence from the Social Security Administration regarding the use of Social Security numbers that didn't match the employees' names. In addition, agents were searching for documents related to the company's reporting of wages and taxes paid and documents that showed any cash payments to employees.
The company's attorney, David Ross, criticized the agency for using a search warrant and employing "SWAT" techniques rather than simply asking for the employment records. Ross said agents spent the whole day at the plant on Raymond Avenue, preventing workers from leaving and stopping sales, production and shipping.
"It was total overkill," he said. "You don't need a warrant and 40 ICE agents to come in and storm the place."
Ross said he believed the move was political and that President Obama is trying to show that his administration is cracking down on illegal immigration. Obama is expected to speak Thursday in Washington, D.C., about the need for comprehensive immigration reform.
Worksite enforcement has been a key part of Obama's immigration policy. The administration has conducted hundreds of workplace audits and arrested dozens of employers.
The chief of ICE, John Morton, has said the agency is focusing on companies that have some link to national security and on employers who are knowingly hiring illegal workers and committing other crimes, such as extorting employees, failing to pay minimum wage or harboring illegal immigrants.
"Are we trying to engage in enforcement that counts? Yes," he said in an earlier interview. "When you are dealing with limited resources and more employers than those resources can cover in a given year, you have to have targeted efforts."

Full text: Author: Marcus Walker; David Gauthier-Villars
Shortly after Nicolas Sarkozy was elected French president in 2007, he met German leader Angela Merkel at an aircraft factory in Toulouse to resolve a Franco-German spat over who should run Airbus, the European plane maker.
Mr. Sarkozy joked that he and Ms. Merkel would make a good management team. "You could look after the details," he said, according to people present. Ms. Merkel responded with a quip of her own: "And you could look after marketing."
The encounter set the tenor for what both sides acknowledge has been a rocky relationship between the leaders of the European Union's dominant powers. Europe's debt crisis is exacerbating the tension, as the indefatigable French president's grand designs have run into the austere chancellor's doubts about the small print.
Europe's "opposite twins," as Mr. Sarkozy sometimes calls his country and Germany, are on different sides of crucial issues in Europe's debate over its economic future, from how best to encourage growth to how to tackle rising public debts.
The leaders have clashed recently on bailouts for Greece, the independence of the European Central Bank, and what shape a new "economic government" for Europe proposed by France should take.
In June, the two sides even quarreled over who was to blame for the last-minute cancellation of a meeting in Berlin that was supposed to clear the air.
Little unites the pair right now apart from sinking authority at home. Mr. Sarkozy's approval rating hit a new low of 26% in an opinion poll by TNS-Sofres released Thursday, amid discontent over ministerial scandals and pension overhauls.
Ms. Merkel, who has also been plumbing new lows in the polls, suffered a revolt on Wednesday by party colleagues who voted against her candidate for German president. She prevailed, but the rebellion underscored dismay in Germany over her leadership and handling of the Greek debt crisis.
Political elites in both countries worry that the prickly atmosphere will complicate efforts to repair flaws in the euro zone's structure, laid bare by the debt crisis.
"Europe cannot move ahead without the Franco-German engine," former French President ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing told a debate at the German embassy in Paris recently.
Close personal bonds and a sense of sharing a historical mission have underpinned Franco-German friendship since the early 1960s, when Germany's Konrad Adenauer and France's Charles de Gaulle buried an enmity that helped trigger two world wars. In the 1980s, their successors FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl held hands at Verdun, scene of the countries' bloodiest battle in World War I, and a few years later they agreed to merge their currencies.
The two countries often disagreed on economics and other matters despite their postwar rapprochement. But their alliance was rooted in an overriding political will to reconcile their points of view--and in a belief that Franco-German compromises were the key to wider European agreements.
That political will and sense of mission have faded along with the generation of politicians who experienced World War II. With the war receding into history books, Germany has lost its reluctance to assert its national interests, including financial ones.
No longer does Germany happily defer to, and use its economic muscle to pay for, French political priorities that once led Gen. de Gaulle to quip that Germany was the horse and France the jockey.
"Everybody in France agrees that Germany is becoming an ordinary country, where 'the European interest' is no longer the default mode," says FranÃ§ois Heisbourg, special adviser at the Foundation for Strategic Research, a Paris-based think tank. "It is inevitable, and worrying about it is like worrying about the rain."
Against this new political backdrop, the awkward personal chemistry between Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Merkel is further complicating the relationship.
The ebullient Mr. Sarkozy, known in France as "le Lapin Duracell," equivalent to the "Energizer Bunny," bombards fellow leaders with initiatives and often announces breakthroughs before deals are sealed.
The cautious Ms. Merkel, known in European Union circles as "Madame Non," admits she likes to make decisions only after lengthy study of all facets of an issue.
On paper, they have much in common.
Both are 55 years old and outsiders in their respective political systems. Mr. Sarkozy, partly descended from Hungarian and Sephardic Jewish immigrants, didn't graduate from the elite universities that produce most of France's leaders, and vowed on his election to shake up France's stodgy economy.
Ms. Merkel grew up in Communist East Germany and entered politics only after German unification, becoming the female, protestant, centrist head of a male- and Catholic-dominated conservative party.
That's where the similarities end. After his election, the Rolex-wearing Frenchman threw a glitzy party on the Champs-ElysÃ©es, vacationed on a billionaire friend's yacht, and married the Italian singer and former supermodel Carla Bruni.
Ms. Merkel is married to a physics professor, and wrote her Ph.D thesis on the mechanisms and speed constants of atomic-decay reactions "on the basis of quantum-chemical and statistical methods."
Her advisers struggled for years before she became chancellor to get her to change her pageboy cut and frumpy clothes. She insisted policies matter, not appearances. She toasted the 2005 coalition pact that made her chancellor with mineral water.
Mr. Sarkozy grew irritated with Berlin within weeks of taking power. At a 2007 EU meeting in Brussels attended by the French president, Ms. Merkel's then-finance minister, Peer SteinbrÃ¼ck, criticized France's loose fiscal policies.
"I won't allow you to talk to me like that," Mr. Sarkozy said, outraged that a minister dared lecture him, according to people present. He later demanded that Ms. Merkel forbid her underlings from criticizing him, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Merkel replied that her minister had spoken for the German government.
Soon, the French president launched an idea for a "Mediterranean Union," a club of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea under de facto French leadership.
The proposal irked Ms. Merkel, who wasn't consulted, because it left aside Germany and the EU, which already had its own cooperation program for the Mediterranean region. After months of argument, Mr. Sarkozy gave in to German objections. "I think I made an effort to understand her concerns," Mr. Sarkozy said at a joint press conference with Ms. Merkel in March 2008.
Despite such public pronouncements, the strains remained.
In private, Ms. Merkel, who has a dry sense of humor, has amused fellow German politicians by imitating Mr. Sarkozy's twitchy body language when he is agitated.
In her quest to understand the Frenchman's mentality, the chancellor, acting on an aide's recommendation, watched movies starring Louis de FunÃ¨s,
a madcap 1960s French comedian whose trademark was to throw vanity-driven tantrums.
In Paris, Mr. Sarkozy sometimes referred to the German chancellor as the "woman from the East" during cabinet meetings, a spokesman let slip. Aides to the president say he was often frustrated because Ms. Merkel didn't show enthusiasm for his initiatives.
Yet both sides still viewed the Franco-German relationship as crucial to any agreement in the EU. Mr. Sarkozy launched a charm offensive.
In May 2008 Ms. Merkel received the prestigious Charlemagne Award for services to Europe, after she brokered a solution on the EU's stalled new constitution. Mr. Sarkozy delivered an effusive tribute, saying: "I love Angela Merkel--much more than people say."
Mr. Sarkozy said he worked so closely with the chancellor that he perhaps saw her more often than her own husband, Joachim Sauer--whom he called "Monsieur Merkel," and congratulated on his wife. "I thank you, dear Nicolas, with all my heart," Ms. Merkel replied in French.
The love-in didn't last. The global banking crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 led to new tiffs between Berlin and Paris, after Mr. Sarkozy proposed a collective EU bailout of the European banking system. Ms. Merkel vetoed that, insisting that each nation support its own banks.
The disagreement reflected a long-brewing change in Germany's attitude towards Europe: The EU's biggest economy was becoming fed up with its role as Europe's paymaster. Years of painful economic overhauls in Germany had boosted the country's finances and industry.
German public opinion was against shelling out hard-saved cash to prop up neighboring countries which Germans felt hadn't bothered to reform themselves.
Ms. Merkel, who used Germany's checkbook to solve an EU budget dispute earlier in her term, now cast herself as protector of the German purse. France found itself increasingly faced with a German veto on its European initiatives.
In November 2008 Mr. Sarkozy again wooed Ms. Merkel, with an invitation to breakfast at Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy's chic apartment in Paris' exclusive 16th arrondissement. Ms. Merkel expressed her appreciation as the president's glamorous wife served foie gras and fresh baguettes.
"I knew you would like it!," exclaimed an exuberant Mr. Sarkozy, who had chosen the menu himself, according to a person familiar with the matter.
But Ms. Merkel didn't swallow Mr. Sarkozy's proposals for a collective EU fiscal stimulus.
Later the same day, the president's impatience showed through when the two leaders held a press conference at the ElysÃ©e Palace. Asked about stimulus measures, he said: "France is working on it, Germany is thinking about it."
A stoical Ms. Merkel, standing next to him, said: "We must be careful that we don't get ahead of ourselves."
Germany eventually enacted a big stimulus in 2009, later than other major economies including France and the U.S., but tensions over Germany's persistently weak domestic demand and reliance on exports remained.
Again the two leaders tried to make nice. At a summit in Pittsburgh last year of the Group of 20 leading economies, Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Merkel chatted on the sidelines. The chancellor said she might copy the president's tactic of recruiting opposition politicians to his cabinet.
Mr. Sarkozy said he was trying to become a calmer, less highly-strung person, according to people who were present.
"I'm morphing into a German Sarkozy," she said, according to aides who were present.
"And I'm Merkelizing myself," he replied.
The two governments began discussing a program to deepen their ties, called "Agenda 2020". But Mr. Sarkozy's desire for symbolism foundered on Ms. Merkel's practical objections.
At a dinner in Berlin last year, Mr. Sarkozy enthused about creating a minister who would be a member of both countries' cabinets. Ms. Merkel was politely non-committal. The idea eventually died. By early this year, the Agenda 2020 consisted of more modest plans, such as opening bilingual kindergartens.
This spring's Greek debt crisis took Franco-German tensions to a new level.
Ms. Merkel, whose electorate strongly opposed bailing out the Greeks, blocked French-backed EU proposals to give Greece more than vague verbal support. When the chancellor finally agreed to rescue Greece, she insisted on involving the International Monetary Fund.
That was anathema to Mr. Sarkozy, who wanted an EU-only solution to show what Europe can do. As it happens, the IMF is headed by a rival, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is considering running against Mr. Sarkozy for the French presidency in 2012. But Mr. Sarkozy had to bow to Germany's financial clout.
The French leader saw his chance to make a mark on May 7, at an EU summit that took place amid a worsening rout of Southern European debt in bond markets. His proposal: The EU should wow financial markets that same day, by announcing a massive bailout fund, big enough to save any struggling euro-zone country.
Mr. Sarkozy arrived early at the Brussels summit and swept in and out of meetings with euro-zone leaders, building support, an entourage of photographers and camera crews in tow.
But Ms. Merkel threw the cameras out of their meeting room, saying: "I'm not going to let you cast me as the stubborn old bag," according to a senior official present.
The barely containable president pressed her for a decision. "We must act," he said: "This is the moment of truth," according to people who were present. These people say Ms. Merkel probed Mr. Sarkozy for details of how the aid fund would work and, finding them hazy, blocked a deal until finance ministers could negotiate them two days later.
Mr. Sarkozy addressed the world media on May 7, claiming he had imposed his will "95%." Ms. Merkel left the summit discreetly. After round-the-clock haggling, the EU agreed on a [euro]750 billion ($917 billion) rescue fund on May 9, but under strict terms laid down by Germany.

Full text: We all know that President Barack Obama was secretly born in Kenya.
And that there will soon be enough Muslims here to take over the country.
And that Presidents Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower collectively deported 15 million illegal immigrants.
We all know these things -- if by "we" you mean certain conservative bloggers and the gullible people who believe them and if by "know" you mean, "take as gospel, even in the absence of evidence." Otherwise, "we" don't know anything of the sort.
So I am intrigued by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer's recent statement: "We all know that the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules." She was responding to a reporter who had asked her for proof of an earlier statement that most illegal immigrants carry narcotics for drug cartels.
Brewer went on to say, "They're coming across our borders in huge numbers. The drug cartels have taken control of the immigration. ... So they are criminals. They're breaking the law when they are trespassing and they're criminals when they pack the marijuana and the drugs on their backs."
You'll notice the one thing she didn't do was answer the question. The one thing she didn't do, or even "attempt" to do, was explain upon what statistics, facts or chain of logic she based her claim.
I will say right here that I have no idea whether that claim is true, though I suspect it's not, given that those who stand literally on the front lines of the immigration battle -- U.S. Border Patrol agents -- have cast doubt upon it. Mario Escalante, a spokesman for the Border Patrol, told The Associated Press the service could not even provide the number of detainees caught carrying drugs, but "I wouldn't say that every person that is apprehended is being used as a mule." T.J. Bonner, speaking for the union that represents the agents, went a step further, telling CNN Brewer's claim doesn't "comport with reality."
You'd think these men, because of their professional standing, could speak with authority on the matter. You'd think their opinions would carry weight. You'd think that would give pause to the governor's airy, unsubstantiated assertions. You'd be naive.
Indeed, hours after speaking with the reporter, Brewer repeated those assertions in a statement. It is, she said, "common knowledge" that Mexican drug cartels use illegal immigrants to smuggle narcotics.
"Common knowledge," she says. "We all know," she says. Again, note the lack of proof. The statement is quantifiable, yet the governor doesn't bother to quantify. But then, you only quantify for the benefit of the head. You toss the raw, red meat of emotion for the benefit of the heart. In this case, the emotions being appealed to could hardly be clearer: nativism, xenophobia and that old standby, fear. And they don't ask any questions.
Maybe you remember the Information Age. At the dawn of the Internet, we were promised a Jeffersonian utopia of instantly available information that would make us a wiser, more enlightened citizenry.
Instead, we find ourselves stranded in a Misinformation Age where truth is multiple choice, geared to your political beliefs, and one need never burden one's cherished and preconceived ideas with anything as fusty and outdated as a demand for verification, authentication, fact.
But some of us are cantankerous apostles of the old school, some of us reflexively suspicious of appeals to the heart that willfully bypass the head -- especially when made by those in position to make policy and law on the basis of things "we all know." So it seems not a lot to ask that next time Gov. Brewer says the majority of illegal immigrants are drug mules, she finally do the one thing she has failed in three attempts to do.
Prove it.

An appeals court on Wednesday tossed out the first federal death sentence given in New York in five decades, finding that prosecutors improperly advised a jury after it convicted a man of killing two undercover police detectives who were posing as gun buyers.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in Manhattan vacated the death sentence given to Ronell Wilson in 2007. The court found that prosecutors violated Wilson's constitutional rights by arguing that Wilson failed to accept responsibility for his crime because he went to trial.
The appeals court said it was unconstitutional to "disallow the death penalty for those who plead guilty but allow it for those who exercise their right to a trial."

An immigration judge in San Diego tentatively granted asylum Wednesday to the son of a Hamas founder who turned his back on his father's terrorist group and became a spy for Israel.
The ruling came after the federal government, without explanation, abruptly dropped concerns that Mosab Hassan Yousef was a terrorist threat.
Yousef, 32, had argued that he would be killed if he were to be deported because he spied on Hamas for Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency and abandoned Islam after becoming a Christian.

An angry Rod Blagojevich is heard grumbling on FBI wiretap tapes played at his corruption trial Wednesday that he is willing to appoint a favorite of Barack Obama to the U.S. Senate, but the newly elected president is "all take and no give."
"The arrogance of these people," Blagojevich, then the Illinois governor, is heard saying a few days after Obama's 2008 election.

Full text: For generations, coal miners gauged the health of their workplace with a critical indicator: canaries. Any buildup of carbon monoxide and other gases would silence the singing canaries before reaching levels toxic to humans.
Today, another leading indicator -- multinational companies headquartered in the U.S. -- is signaling widespread and legitimate concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. A new McKinsey report that the three of us advised argues that all Americans should heed their message.
U.S. multinational companies have long been among America's strongest firms. Although they comprise far less than 1% of U.S. companies, they account for about 19% of all private jobs, 25% of all private wages, 48% of total exports of goods, and a remarkable 74% of nonpublic R&D spending. For decades, U.S. multinationals have driven an outsized share of U.S. productivity growth, the foundation of rising standards of living for everyone. They are responsible for 41% of the increase in private labor productivity since 1990.
Despite the common allegation that multinationals simply "export jobs" out of the U.S., research shows that expansion abroad by these firms has tended to complement -- not substitute for -- their U.S. operations. More investment and employment abroad have tended to create more American investment and jobs as well. From 1988 to 2007, employment in foreign affiliates rose to 10 million from 4.8 million. During that same period, employment in U.S. parent companies rose to 22 million from 17.7 million.
But there is no guarantee that the past will be prologue. McKinsey conducted in-depth interviews with senior executives from 26 of America's largest and best-known multinationals. Their message is sobering: Today the U.S. is in an era of global competition to attract, retain and grow the operations of multinational companies that it's never faced before.
These leading executives laud many longstanding economic strengths of the U.S., such as its large and competitive domestic market. But they also see dozens of other countries -- and not just fast-growing economies such as Brazil, Russia, India and China -- making dramatic improvements in the policies and overall economic environment they present to the world's leading companies. These improvements are not simply a matter of tax holidays and other financial subsidies. Rather, these countries have opened their markets broadly, and they are redefining where U.S. multinationals can successfully operate.
All of the business leaders interviewed for this study agreed that U.S. tax policy has a "major impact" on their competitiveness and investment decisions, and most said that policies like limits on skilled immigration handicap their companies. In the words of one executive, tax considerations are "often one of the largest line items in the investment projection." Moreover, many of these leaders voiced concern about the future ability of this country to attract and grow corporate investment, R&D and jobs. U.S. multinationals will not aggressively invest and hire here at home if they can't realize attractive returns from doing so.
It is our strong belief that their concerns must be taken seriously by U.S. policy makers at all levels. We aren't saying that America's economic policy should be driven by the considerations of U.S. multinational firms alone-- far from it. But when millions of American workers are facing severe hardship, driving our strongest companies with the best-paying jobs overseas certainly won't help. Lawmakers must acknowledge the outsized contributions multinationals have made to America's economic strength.
The world and the options it presents to global firms have changed dramatically in recent years; the U.S. cannot rest on past success and take its multinationals for granted. Policy makers must partner with business leaders to craft policies aimed at sustaining an environment in which U.S. multinationals can thrive. If they don't, going forward we all should expect smaller contributions to the U.S. economy by less vibrant U.S. multinationals: less R&D, less investment, fewer exports and fewer jobs.
There are several deep challenges now facing the U.S. economy in the wake of the financial crisis. Perhaps most importantly, U.S. companies have yet to resume vigorous job creation. Peak to trough thus far, the U.S. economy has lost 8.5 million private payroll jobs -- down to 107.1 million in December 2009 from 115.6 million December 2007. In the past five months, the U.S. has regained only 495,000 private jobs -- and more than a third are temporary. In addition to creating more jobs, America's economy needs to be rebalanced away from consumption and towards capital investment and exports.
U.S. multinationals are uniquely positioned to help America meet these challenges. But this will require far-sighted policy initiatives like liberalizing trade and protecting intellectual property.
These firms are now the canaries in the U.S. economic coal mine. Will our lawmakers pay attention?

Full text: In an ongoing fight against intellectual piracy, federal authorities seized the domain names of nine websites accused of letting users watch on-demand versions of first-run movies.
Referring to the sites as "among the most popular" websites for distributing illegal copies of movies, the government highlighted copies of films currently in theaters, such as "Toy Story 3" and "The A-Team," for evidence to obtain the warrant.
The nine sites had registered their domain names via U.S.-based registration services, allowing authorities to take control of their site addresses. Some were run on computers based in the U.S. -- in Colorado, Florida and Illinois. But others used computers based in Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the Czech Republic.
At a Wednesday news conference in Burbank, Calif., the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency said authorities had seized some assets, funds and equipment, and had executed four search warrants at U.S. residences.
Citing an ongoing investigation, they declined to offer further specifics or say whether they had any arrests.
ICE Assistant Secretary John Morton acknowledged that some of the foreign-based websites could reappear at different addresses.
Mr. Morton said at the news conference that on June 15 alone, 37,000 people had watched "Sex and the City 2" on one of the sites, TVShack.net.
The other sites include Movies-Links.tv, Filespump.com, ZML.com, Now-Movies.com, ThePirateCity.org, PlanetMoviez.com, NinjaVideo.net and NinjaThis.net.
Attempts to contact the websites weren't successful.
Unlike most other antipirating efforts, the focus in this crackdown wasn't on downloads. Rather, many of the sites let users "stream" movies free, and supported themselves by selling advertising. While that's a similar model to legitimate video-watching sites, such as Hulu.com, the sites targeted by the enforcement action had no licenses to show the movies, and didn't pay the studios that created them.
The government pointed to TVShack.net's attempt to cool off users upset with slow loading times for the movies:
"[P]lease keep in mind that you're watching videos for free as opposed to spending over 20 dollars at the [movie] theater or purchasing a show," an affidavit quoted TVShack as saying. "This should help you put things in perspective."
Visitors to the web pages will be redirected to a page that notifies them the sites have been seized by the government.
Mr. Morton and several movie-studio executives sought to portray online piracy as harmful to America's economic interests, saying that Hollywood employs 2.5 million Americans in 50 states.
"Counterfeiting and piracy hurt American workers, pure and simple," Mr. Morton said.
"These are good, middle-class jobs," added Thom Davis, a vice president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, a movie-industry workers' union.
Movie studios, artists and media companies have long battled illegal file-sharing and piracy sites with a variety of legal tactics over the years.
Most recently, the producers of "The Hurt Locker" sued 5,000 people who downloaded the Oscar winning war movie from BitTorrent networks.
Asked whether ICE would similarly go after individuals, Mr. Morton said: "Right now our focus is on the sites themselves."
Mr. Morton acknowledged that when it comes to online distribution technologies like BitTorrent that do not store copies of media centrally, authorities may have a difficult time taking steps like the ones announced Wednesday. "It's a challenge," he said. "There's a level of sophistication government can't always match."
"I don't think we've stopped Internet piracy in a day," Mr. Morton said. "But this is going to be a sustained effort."
Wednesday's announcement was part of a broader effort to crack down on other forms of piracy and counterfeiting, such as pharmaceuticals.

Full text: MADRID -- Alexandra Gorosabel and her family came to Spain during the past decade's economic boom determined to escape the poverty of their home country of Ecuador. But the collapsing Spanish economy and tighter immigration restrictions have dashed their dreams.
Ms. Gorosabel's husband lost his gardening job this year and she could find only a few hours' work as a house cleaner, laboring illegally. So in June, the 35-year-old Ms. Gorosabel decided to return to Ecuador with her two young children. "I'm wasting my youth here, for nothing," she said, adding that she expects her husband will soon follow her home.
Spain's sky-high unemployment and a backlash against foreign workers that was sparked by the downturn have put the brakes on what experts consider one of developed world's biggest immigration booms in modern times. Overall, immigrant arrivals have dwindled to a trickle, and there has been an outflow of workers from some major feeder countries like Ecuador.
Reflecting Spain's economic woes, Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday put its triple-A credit rating on review for a possible downgrade. The move follows Fitch Ratings' downgrade of Spain from the coveted top rating. That one-notch cut added pressure to the euro and stocks. In April, Standard & Poor's cut Spain to double-A.
In Ecuador, remittances from workers in Spain have fallen 20%, and the government has had to devise programs to help returnees find work and adapt psychologically to their abrupt homecoming. In a recent interview with the Spanish press, Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said tougher European immigration policies represented a "monstrous inconsistency" and "historic ingratitude," pointing out that Latin America opened its doors to Spanish refugees after the rise of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco in the 1930s.
During the prosperous decade that ended in 2007, Spain maintained one of Europe's most accommodating immigration policies, as it sought laborers for surging construction and service industries. Partly thanks to an amnesty for illegal immigrants, easy procedures for immigrants to bring over family members and aggressive foreign recruitment, immigrants filled an estimated 40% of the six million jobs Spain created in 1997 to 2007, according to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates.
Over the past decade, Spain's foreign-born population has grown more than 500%, to just over 5.7 million, making up more than 12% of the population. Latin America is the largest regional source of immigrants, but Romania and Morocco are the top two individual sending countries, followed by Ecuador.
When Spain's construction-dependant economy cratered amid the global financial crisis, the government sharply curtailed foreign-worker recruitment programs, limited family reunifications and stiffened penalties on employers of illegal immigrants. Spain created a Voluntary Return Program, paying accumulated unemployment benefits as an incentive to get legal immigrants to go home.
Immigrants have borne the brunt of job losses and their unemployment rate has shot up to 30%, from 12% in 2007, compared with the 20% national average.
Ecuadorean fisherman Gustavo Luzuriaga had been in Spain seven years, but he returned home last year after he couldn't find work on a boat. "Everything had gone sour there, and there was not much hope for the future," he said.
The number of Ecuadoreans living in Spain fell 26,357 in 2009, to 395,069, according to municipal registry rolls -- considered the most reliable tally of immigrants in Spain. Overall, Spain's foreign-born population grew just 1% in 2009, compared with 17% in 2007, according to municipal data.
Laura Tedesco, an Argentine political scientist who is a visiting professor at the Autonomous University of Madrid, says there is a limit to how many migrants will abandon Spain despite the hardship there.
"Many of these migrants are not coming from cities like Quito, but from the interior where there are no basic services at all," she says, adding that even if they find little work in Spain, many Latin American migrants will decide to stay there, for free health care and education.
Even though returning home is the last recourse, Lorena Escudero, head of Ecuador's National Secretariat for Migrants, said the number of returnees was up sharply last year from the U.S., as well as Spain. In the past couple of years, Ecuador has rolled out programs to assist returnees, including offering psychological assistance for migrants who lost jobs or were deported, as well as allowing returnees to ship back their belongings without paying customs duties.
Ecuador also launched the Cucayo Fund, a program of financial grants and mentoring aimed at helping returnees set up businesses. The government has helped finance 240 start-ups, including Mr. Luzuriaga's new fishing boat, "The Pepe Soles."
Another grant recipient is Christian Lopez, who returned in mid-2008 after a decade in Spain working in construction and parcel delivery. He invested the grant money, along with the proceeds from the sale of an apartment in Spain he had unloaded near the peak of the real-estate boom, into the Off Side recreation center, featuring a restaurant and soccer field. He says weakness in Ecuador's oil-based economy made the going tougher than expected at first. But with his mentor's help, Mr. Lopez has fine-tuned his business plan, recently adding a soccer school he says looks like a good revenue generator.
Cucayo participants such as Claudia Landivar, who came back from Spain to start a cosmetics business, say the guidance from the mentor is as important as the grant money.
"I knew nothing of bookkeeping, until our mentor showed us," she says, adding that her business is going well. "I feel lucky I'm not in Spain today."

Richard Murphy was depicted in court documents as a stay-at-home dad who lived a cushy lifestyle and produced little espionage. His planned Sunday departure from the U.S. triggered authorities to move in. All but one of the 11 members of the alleged ring remain in custody; one suspect apparently jumped bail in Cyprus.
Information released so far indicates none of the alleged Russian agents worked for the U.S. government.

Portland Police Reopen
Al Gore Investigation
Police in Portland, Ore., are reopening an investigation over allegations that former Vice President Al Gore fondled a masseuse in a hotel in 2006.
The city's Police Bureau disclosed the move in a brief statement Wednesday, but did not explain the decision to reopen the investigation. The police said they would not comment further.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Gore said the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize winner denies the allegations. "Further investigation into this matter will only benefit Mr. Gore," said spokeswoman Kalee Kreider.

MICHIGAN
Deficit for Detroit Schools
To Balloon Despite Cuts
Detroit's ailing public schools suffered an unexpected setback Wednesday when the district announced its budget deficit would balloon in the new fiscal year.
The news comes despite deep cut backs by an emergency financial manager hired by the Michigan governor last year to repair the system's finances. The district, which serves about 84,000 students is projecting the deficit to rise 66% to $363 million from the fiscal year that ended Wednesday.

Asylum for Ex-Israeli Spy
An immigration judge in San Diego tentatively granted asylum Wednesday to the son of a Hamas founder who turned his back on his father's terrorist group and became a spy for Israel. The ruling came after the federal government dropped concerns that Mosab Hassan Yousef was a terrorist threat. Mr. Yousef, 32, argued he would be killed if he was deported.

ENVIRONMENT
Bank Reconsiders Coal Deal
The U.S. Export-Import Bank on Wednesday backed down from an environmental-protection stand that threatened to cost hundreds of U.S. jobs. The agency said its board would reconsider a decision against providing loan guarantees to help finance the purchase of U.S. coal-mining equipment by Reliance Power Ltd. of India. Wisconsin's Bucyrus International Inc. hopes to sell equipment with the help of loan guarantees.

(Please see Corrections & Amplifications below.)
A Nigerian detective unravels a web of corruption, suspecting an inside job when a bomb goes off at the mansion of a rich political candidate. A Japanese physics professor gets sucked into a murder investigation targeting a single mother in Tokyo, and tangles with his old university rival. A Turkish-German investigator in Frankfurt takes on a gang of neo-fascist Croatians involved in human trafficking.
It seems a certain Swedish hacker heroine with a dragon tattoo has paved the way for a surge of international crime fiction.
Spurred by the popularity of Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's trilogy, which has sold more than 40 million copies world-wide, U.S. publishers are combing the globe for the next big foreign crime novel. While major publishing houses have long avoided works in translation, many are now courting international literary agents, commissioning sample translations, tracking best-seller lists overseas and pouncing on writers who win literary prizes in Europe and Asia. The result is a new wave of detective fiction that's broadening and redefining the classic genre.
In the coming months, Minotaur Books, a mystery-and-thriller imprint of St. Martin's, will publishÂ new crime and suspense fiction from Iceland, Japan, Nigeria, South Africa and, naturally, Sweden. A few years ago, most of the imprint's international authors were British.
"A lot of publishers are looking at this because they don't want to miss the next Stieg Larsson," says Kelley Ragland,Â Minotaur's editorial director.
Some have pegged Japan as the next crime-writing hotspot. Literary agent Amanda Urban of International Creative Management, who represents Cormac McCarthy and Toni Morrison, took on Japanese suspense and crime writer Shuichi Yoshida, a best-selling author in Japan, because she saw his novels as literary works with commercial potential. "Crime really crosses over," says Ms. Urban.
Mystery novels translate well across cultures, because they usually prize plot over literary acrobatics. The global influence of American and British crime writing has also led to the widespread adoption of familiar tropes and plot conventions: the gloomy, loner detective, clipped dialogue, the standard plot structure that opens with a body and follows the investigation. Best-selling Turkish crime writer Mehmet Murat Somer, who writes a series about a cross-dressing Istanbul detective with an Audrey Hepburn alter ego, says he's been heavily influenced by Agatha Christie and Patricia Highsmith. Penguin published a U.S. edition of his book "The Kiss Murder" in 2008, and has another translation, "The Wig Murders," under contract for 2011.
Many cultures have crime writing traditions that stretch back centuries. Early examples of Chinese crime writing date to the 18th century; Japanese writers were telling crime stories as early as the 1600s. By the 1920s and 1930s, commonly referred to as the Golden Age of detective fiction, British and American crime writers came to define the genre.
More recently, crime writers around the globe have developed their own brands of crime fiction, often blending classic suspense story telling techniques with regional themes and literary styles. In Italy, where there's been an explosion of crime fiction lately, Albanian, Serbian and Asian immigrants have started to replace mafia dons as the favorite fictional crime lords. South African crime fiction tends to be noir-tinged and ultraviolent, with nods to the lingering effects of apartheid. Most Swedish crime writing turns on political and social issues (the original Swedish title of Mr. Larsson's "Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" was "Men Who Hate Women"). Latin American crime novels often center on drug trafficking and police corruption; "narco-novels" about drug lords are booming in Mexico.
Some American crime writers are now taking cues from abroad. Best-selling author Michael Connelly says that he's started bringing politics and economic issues into his novels after reading a lot of South African and European crime fiction. He's now working on a novel that touches on the mortgage crisis: an angry homeowner murders the banker who forecloses on her home. "Writers and readers in other countries tend to look at crime novels as social novels," he says.
Much of the crime fiction being imported blurs the line between genre and literary fiction. In Europe, where crime novels take top literary prizes, suspense writing is regarded as a serious literary endeavor rather than a form of mass entertainment. In Japan, top mystery writers Shuichi Yoshida and Keigo Higashino have won multiple literary awards.
Minotaur is betting big on Mr. Higashino with a first print run of 75,000 copies for his novel "The Devotion of Suspect X," which comes out in the U.S. next February.
Keith Kahla, executive editor of St. Martin's Press, described the author as the Japanese equivalent of James Patterson or Stephen King. "He's huge, and he's utterly unknown here," says Mr. Kahla, who had never heard of Mr. Higashino before he was approached by the author's agent. Just one of Mr. Higashino's books, "Naoko," had been previously translated into English and released by a small American literary press in 2004.
"The Devotion of Suspect X" is part of Mr. Higashino's popular "Galileo" series about a university physics professor with an uncanny ability to crack tough murder cases. The five books in the series have sold more than 3.2 million copies in Japan; more than a dozen of Mr. Higashino's books have been adapted into films and TV dramas in Japan. "Suspect X" starts with a murder in a Tokyo apartment complex. A single mother strangles her ex-husband, and her neighbor, a math teacher, helps cover up the crime. A cat-and-mouse game unfolds as the math genius tries to elude the detectives and his old university rival, the physics professor.
The flat, unadorned prose and police-procedural elements of "The Devotion of Suspect X" will likely appeal to fans of American crime fiction, but much about the novel remains particular to Japan, down to the detectives' exceedingly polite interrogation techniques and the murder weapon (the victim is strangled with an electrical cord attached to a kotatsu, a low, heated table common in Japanese households).
"It has a very clean, very primal, and hence very universal setup," Mr. Kahla says of the book's crossover potential.
Pantheon Books has also been snapping up Japanese crime fiction: Pantheon will release Mr. Yoshida's 2007 novel "Villain," a murder-and-manhunt tale set on the coast, this August. In Japan, Mr. Yoshida, 41, has published 10 books--four have been made into films and television dramas--and won several major literary awards for his novels, which often feature rootless, lonely characters in their 20s. He has been published elsewhere in Asia and in France but never translated into English before. "Villain" opens with the arrest of a young construction worker for the murder of an insurance saleswoman. The investigation turns up other suspects, and the moody narrative unfolds from multiple characters' perspectives. Pantheon also bought Mr. Yoshida's 2002 novel "Parade," featuring five young Tokyo roommates whose neighborhood is hit by a string of gruesome murders targeting women, which is scheduled for publication in 2012.
The flood of imported crime fiction is striking given American publishers' longstanding resistance to works in translation. Newly translated books still make up just 3% of titles released in the U.S., according to Bowker, a company that tracks the publishing industry, and translated fiction and poetry make up less than 1%. In many European countries, translated books account for 25% to 40% of titles.
A recent string of surprise best sellers has eroded the notion that Americans prefer home-grown authors. A 2008 translation of the French literary novel "The Elegance of the Hedgehog" from Europa Editions, an independent press dedicated to European fiction in translation, sold more than 500,000 copies here; Stieg Larsson's trilogy has sold more than six million copies in the U.S.
As focus shifts toward international hits, American editors who used to rely on international book fairs and pitches from literary agents have gotten more proactive. Some are asking translators to suss out rising literary talents and provide plot synopses for books that are creeping up best-seller lists overseas. Ms. Urban, who represents Japanese author and international literary star Haruki Murakami, learned about Mr. Yoshida's crime novels from Philip Gabriel, Mr. Murakami's American translator.
Carol Janeway, a senior editor and director of international rights at Knopf, tracks rising European literary stars by keeping an eye on Germany, which tends to lead the way in translating literature from other countries. Ms. Janeway, who also translates German novels, discovered Swedish novelists such as Hakan Nesser and Arne Dahl by reading German editions. This February, Pantheon will publish the first novel in Mr. Dahl's popular crime series, which has sold more than two million copies in Europe.
Some small presses have also found that international crime can be profitable. Revenue at Bitter Lemon Press, an international publisher that focuses on translated crime fiction, has grown roughly 12% a year since the imprint was created five years ago, says co-founder FranÃ§ois von Hurter, who declined to provide overall sales figures. The press's top-selling authors include Italian crime writer Gianrico Carofiglio and Leonardo Padura from Cuba.
In October,Â New York-based independent press Melville House will launch an imprint devoted to international crime fiction, featuring mostly works in translation. Fall titles include "Cut Throat Dog," a psychological thriller about an ex-Mossad agent by Israeli novelist Joshua Sobol, and "Kismet," a 2007 novel by German writer Jakob Arjouni, whichÂ centers onÂ an ethnically Turkish private investigator.
Translated fiction is still a hard sell, and many U.S. publishers remain wary. Foreign rights rarely exceed four or five figures, but translating a book can add tens of thousands to production costs. Marketing a book by an unknown author poses challenges, particularly if the writer doesn't speak English.
Publishers seem increasingly willing to gamble, however, especially on Nordic noir. The Stockholm-based Salomonsson Agency, which represents 36 Scandinavian writers, has sold nearly 40 books to U.S. publishers in the last three years, says co-founder Niclas Salomonsson. Twenty-one went to Alfred A. Knopf, which publishes Mr. Larsson and recently signed Jo NesbÃ¸, who was formerly with HarperCollins. This spring, Simon & Schuster's Atria Books paid more than $500,000 for rights to four novels by Swedish crime queen Liza Marklund, whose books have sold 12 million copies world-wide.
Publishers and agents going after the next big thing say the U.S. market for Nordic noir may have reached a saturation point, and are looking farther afield. Kent Wolf of Global Literary Management, an agency that focuses on international fiction, says he's focusing on suspense novels from Asia. Mr. Wolf represents five writers from Asia, including South Korean novelist Young-ha Kim, whose spy thriller "Your Republic Is Calling You," will be published this September by Mariner Books. The novel, a "24"-like thriller, unfolds in a single day and features a North Korean spy who is activated after spending 21 years undercover in South Korea.
The explosion of crime fiction overseas could come at a price for U.S. publishers. Danny Baror, president of Baror International, which sells foreign rights for more than 100 American authors, says his sales have dropped by 25% in Germany and 15% in France and Italy in recent years because publishers there are focused on local writers. His worst market is Scandinavia, where sales have dropped by 90% since 2000: local stars like Mr. Dahl and Ms. Marklund now dominate there.
"We used to sell our entire catalogue in Sweden," Mr. Baror says. "These days, they only buy Robert Ludlum."Â

Full text: Author: Laura Meckler
President Barack Obama laid out the case for his stalled effort to overhaul immigration laws on Thursday, and challenged Republicans who once backed the initiative to come forward again.
It was Mr. Obama's first speech as president devoted to the issue, and it came as many advocates of an overhaul, particularly in the Hispanic community, have become increasingly frustrated by a lack of action.
"The system is broken, and everybody knows it," Mr. Obama said at American University in Washington, D.C. "Unfortunately, reform has been held hostage to political posturing...and to the pervasive sentiment in Washington that tackling such a thorny and emotional issue is inherently bad politics."
The broad framework of the legislation Mr. Obama favors has been clear for some time, and on Thursday he again endorsed the underlying ideas. They include better securing the border, providing a path to citizenship for those now here illegally and creating a guest-worker program.
Mr. Obama presented no new ideas or initiatives, and it remained unclear how the measure could win approval in the Senate, where Republican backing is essential but so far elusive.
That fact, combined with a busy congressional calendar, suggests that the chances for action this year are near zero.
Mr. Obama blamed the GOP for inaction. He singled out his 2008 presidential rival, Arizona Sen. John McCain, who co-sponsored immigration legislation in 2006 but has walked away from that stance amid a primary-election challenge from the right.
"Now, under the pressures of partisanship and election-year politics, many of the 11 Republican senators who voted for reform in the past have now backed away from their previous support," Mr. Obama said.
Mr. McCain has said the U.S.-Mexico border must be secured before a comprehensive bill can advance. On Thursday, McCain spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan added that Mr. Obama's speech lacked specifics and said the president didn't understand the real threats at the border.
"The speech was full of political rhetoric blaming Republicans for what is truly a lack of will by his administration and Democrat leaders in Congress," she said.
In pushing for legislation, the president may also make political gains ahead of November elections. If Hispanics are frustrated with the White House, they may be more angry with Republicans who block action.
Mr. Obama said he made the speech now because immigration has been in the news, with attention focusing on a contentious Arizona law that requires police to question people they suspect are in the U.S. illegally. Mr. Obama again criticized that measure, and his Justice Department is expected to file suit to try to block it.

Abstract: In the 1950s and '60s, good waves combined with local technology -- the advent of plastic foam, especially -- and the attention of the movie industry to make surfing a global phenomenon. Because they tend to be outsiders, a lot of surfers never thought of what they were doing as history.

Full text: If you owned a surfboard 20, 40 or even 60 years ago, and used it often, there's a group of people in San Clemente who would really like to hear from you.
Maybe you surfed a stretch of coastline when the waves were taller than they are today -- because a certain harbor and breakwater didn't exist back then.
Maybe you surfed in a time and place where few others did. Like Dick Huffman, now 98, who would go out to the beaches of Corona del Mar in the 1920s with a bathing suit, some lumber and an ax, and make his own board before heading into the water.
Or maybe you knew someone like Gordon "Mike" Howes, who in the 1930s was among the first to ride the waves in New Jersey -- using his mother's ironing board. "It was just about the length and size and shape to ride the waves with," Howes said.
Howes spoke those words last year, not long before he died. His story was saved thanks to the Surfing Heritage Foundation, which is undertaking a big effort to collect the oral histories of surfers from California and elsewhere.
"We're running out of the old-timers," said Craig Lockwood, a veteran surfing writer and Laguna Beach native who is a bit of an old-timer himself. He's 72 and stopped surfing only last year. "The World War II generation is in their late 80s and 90s now," he told me. "They were the pioneers. They made surfing happen."
I met Lockwood last week at the Surfing Heritage Foundation's headquarters in San Clemente, amid a stunning collection of vintage surfboards, the oldest of which are massive planks of redwood and pine. I was there to discover things I didn't know about a rich and colorful culture created right here in California.
But I also learned something else: about the kind of work and dedication it takes to keep memories alive.
The Surfing Heritage Foundation is reaching out across the surfing world with a loud call: Send us your oral histories, your tales of beach campfires and "board shaping." They've even created an oral history manual, with some how-to tips on conducting interviews for posterity.
"It's the people we don't know that we're looking for," said Paul Holmes, a former editor of Surfer magazine and one of the leaders of the effort.
In four years of work, they've interviewed more than 100 men and women and have some great finds. Last year, their volunteer historians sat down with Tulie Clark and Fenton Scholes, who told them how the Palos Verdes Surfing Club was founded in the 1930s.
Back then, the boards were 11-foot-long behemoths that were 4 inches thick. Surfing culture was so new it seemed all the surfers in town knew one another.
"When we surfed, everyone who went for the wave got it," Scholes said. "There wasn't any 'This is my wave' stuff. Everybody rode together, four or five guys on a wave. If some guy was next to you, you pulled his board in. You didn't pull him out."
Surfing's roots are in Polynesia, but the sport and lifestyle of modern surfing were born right here in Southern California, during an especially affluent and hopeful time in our history. In the 1950s and '60s, good waves combined with local technology -- the advent of plastic foam, especially -- and the attention of the movie industry to make surfing a global phenomenon.
From the beginning, surfing attracted a certain kind of rebel unique to California.
Exhibit A could be the late Dale Velzy, who in his final days told his story to Holmes. "He was a surfer, a biker, a hot-rodder, a cowboy and a surf industry pioneer -- all at once," said Holmes, the author of the biography "Dale Velzy is Hawk."
Because they tend to be outsiders, a lot of surfers never thought of what they were doing as history. The surfing media didn't get started until 1960, and everything we know about surfing before then begins with a spoken tale.
E.J. Oshier, who pioneered surfing in San Onofre and a beachside music scene called "The Bamboo Room Philharmonic," shared some of those stories with the oral history project in 2007.
He remembered throwing a sleeping bag into his old Plymouth in 1941 and heading for the waves in Santa Cruz.
"It was a bright, sunny Sunday morning," Oshier told an interviewer about a week before he died. "Heaven was close by." And then some "rotten" guy standing by the cliffs yelled out something about the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor. Oshier paddled back in and went off to war.
"I never surfed Santa Cruz again."
The Surfing Heritage Foundation is sending letters and its oral history guide to surfing clubs across the U.S. and beyond. They're dreaming of the day when their mailbox fills with surfing stories recorded by aficionados near and far.
It's an effort that should be emulated by many other groups in Southern California.
This metropolis by the sea is, after all, a place where many different subcultures have first appeared and thrived. Immigrants, artists and entrepreneurs have written epic California tales with their ambition and their hunger for the new.
As someone who interviews people for a living, I can tell you with certainty: You never know what you'll learn when you sit down with someone and start asking questions.
Jed Justeson, a filmmaker and non-surfer, has interviewed about 20 people for the Surfing Heritage project. He's learned that "most of surfing is waiting in the water" and that "a lot of the camaraderie comes from that waiting." He's come to appreciate the great patience and love of nature most surfers share.
"They all have something to teach you if you take the time to listen," he said.

Abstract: In his first major speech on the issue since taking office, President Obama said Thursday that the U.S. immigration system "offends our most basic American values" and blamed Republican opposition for thwarting crucially needed change. Speaking to religious and political activists Thursday, Obama recalled congressional steps toward immigration-restructuring under President George W. Bush, when a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers supported a comprehensive solution.

Full text: Correction: Thursday, July 08, 2010: Obama and immigration: An article in Friday's Section A about President Obama's call to revamp immigration policy said a new Arizona law allows police to question those they suspect of being illegal immigrants after making an unlawful stop. Police are required to check the immigration status of people they suspect are in the country illegally only after they have lawfully stopped, detained or arrested them.
In his first major speech on the issue since taking office, President Obama said Thursday that the U.S. immigration system "offends our most basic American values" and blamed Republican opposition for thwarting crucially needed change.
It was the third time in as many days that Obama singled out Republicans as an obstructionist force, blaming them in his earlier appearances for defending oil giant BP in the aftermath of the Gulf Coast oil spill and for opposing stronger financial regulatory legislation.
The president's remarks this week represented the clearest preview yet of the message the White House intends to highlight in this year's midterm election: Republicans' stubborn refusal to help solve national problems.
The theme appeared to galvanize many supporters of immigration legislation who were in the audience at American University for Obama's speech Thursday.
"I think it was a clarion call," said Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. "He implied, 'The ball is in your court.' "
Republicans shot back with a sizzling critique of the president's position, dismissing Obama's argument that the U.S.-Mexican border was more secure now than in years.
"Half a million people still illegally enter our country today, most through Arizona, and his administration has yet to lay out a strategy on how it intends to bring it under control," said Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.).
The immigration debate has been fueled by passage of an Arizona law that allows police to question those they suspect of being illegal immigrants after making an unlawful stop. The Obama administration is expected to announce soon that it will file a legal challenge to that law.
Speaking to religious and political activists Thursday, Obama recalled congressional steps toward immigration-restructuring under President George W. Bush, when a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers supported a comprehensive solution.
"Unfortunately, reform has been held hostage to political posturing and special-interest wrangling," Obama said. "Now, under the pressures of partisanship and election-year politics, many of the 11 Republican senators who voted for reform in the past have now backed away from their previous support."
Nonetheless, Obama offered no new solutions, timetables or points of compromise. Instead, he outlined a longstanding prescription for change that, in addition to having no support from Republicans in Congress, also has failed to unite his fellow Democrats.
Some activists had asked the president to speak at Ellis Island, the historical New York entry port, on the Fourth of July. But Obama chose to deliver his immigration address ahead of the Independence Day weekend and before a crowd at American University.
In that sense, it was an innately political speech, aimed via television at a Latino and Democratic audience vital to the Democratic strategy in this fall's elections.
"Latinos are a key part of the equation," Eliseo Medina, international executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, said after the address. "We're going to make a difference in Nevada, Arizona, Texas, California and Florida. So in many ways, the Republicans are playing with fire. Hopefully they'll get that message."
Some immigration advocates who have criticized Obama in the past for not treating the immigration issue with sufficient urgency said they were happy Thursday to see him devote a national speech to the subject, even if he made no commitment to pass a bill this year.
"This is the beginning of a new phase in this debate," said Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democratic Network, a think tank, who was in the American University audience. "The Republican Party's position now is untenable and unsustainable."
The address came close on the heels of comments by Obama in Wisconsin this week in which he called out a House lawmaker who apologized to BP executives for pressure being exerted by the White House.
The president also criticized House Republican leader John A. Boehner of Ohio for saying administration-backed financial regulatory legislation aimed at Wall Street practices was like using a nuclear weapon to kill an ant.
During a White House meeting with Latino activists this week, Obama blamed Republicans for the presence of 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., participants said, foreshadowing the Thursday speech.
Obama's address was closely watched across the country. In Los Angeles, about two dozen workers, students and advocates gathered at a community center to listen. As the president spoke, a low hum of interpretation followed his words.
Olga Gonzalez, 42, said she was frustrated that an overhaul bill hadn't been enacted yet and was skeptical that that would happen in 2010.
"He said in his first year he would do it and he didn't," she said. "Now the November elections are coming."
An illegal immigrant with four U.S. citizen children, Gonzalez said she worried every day about being arrested by immigration agents and separated from her family. About three months ago, she took in two American children of a friend who was deported.
"Every day, they ask, 'When is my mommy coming back?' " she said.
But Myrna Ortiz, a UCLA student and illegal immigrant, said she was inspired by the speech and had hopes that it would help kick-start the political process.
Ortiz, 19, said her undocumented status had affected her education, her job prospects and her healthcare. Her parents are also illegal immigrants, and she has a younger sister who is a U.S. citizen.
"We are going to keep pushing," Ortiz said. "If we don't push for it, it's not going to happen."

Full text: [Detective novels from Japan, Nigeria, Germany and Korea are pouring into the U.S. as publishers hunt for the next 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.' In pursuit of the new international man of mystery.]
A Nigerian detective unravels a web of corruption, suspecting an inside job when a bomb goes off at the mansion of a rich political candidate. A Japanese physics professor gets sucked into a murder investigation targeting a single mother in Tokyo, and tangles with his old university rival. A Turkish-German investigator in Frankfurt takes on a gang of neo-fascist Croatians involved in human trafficking.
It seems a certain Swedish hacker heroine with a dragon tattoo has paved the way for a surge of international crime fiction.
Spurred by the popularity of Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's trilogy, which has sold more than 40 million copies world-wide, U.S. publishers are combing the globe for the next big foreign crime novel. While major publishing houses have long avoided works in translation, many are now courting international literary agents, commissioning sample translations, tracking best-seller lists overseas and pouncing on writers who win literary prizes in Europe and Asia. The result is a new wave of detective fiction that's broadening and redefining the classic genre.
In the coming months, Minotaur Books, a mystery-and-thriller imprint of St. Martin's, will publish new crime and suspense fiction from Iceland, Japan, Nigeria, South Africa and, naturally, Sweden. A few years ago, most of the imprint's international authors were British.
"A lot of publishers are looking at this because they don't want to miss the next Stieg Larsson," says Kelley Ragland, Minotaur's editorial director.
Some have pegged Japan as the next crime-writing hotspot. Literary agent Amanda Urban of International Creative Management, who represents Cormac McCarthy and Toni Morrison, took on Japanese suspense and crime writer Shuichi Yoshida, a best-selling author in Japan, because she saw his novels as literary works with commercial potential. "Crime really crosses over," says Ms. Urban.
Mystery novels translate well across cultures, because they usually prize plot over literary acrobatics. The global influence of American and British crime writing has also led to the widespread adoption of familiar tropes and plot conventions: the gloomy, loner detective, clipped dialogue, the standard plot structure that opens with a body and follows the investigation. Best-selling Turkish crime writer Mehmet Murat Somer, who writes a series about a cross-dressing Istanbul detective with an Audrey Hepburn alter ego, says he's been heavily influenced by Agatha Christie and Patricia Highsmith. Penguin published a U.S. edition of his book "The Kiss Murder" in 2008, and has another translation, "The Wig Murders," under contract for 2011.
Many cultures have crime writing traditions that stretch back centuries. Early examples of Chinese crime writing date to the 18th century; Japanese writers were telling crime stories as early as the 1600s. By the 1920s and 1930s, commonly referred to as the Golden Age of detective fiction, British and American crime writers came to define the genre.
More recently, crime writers around the globe have developed their own brands of crime fiction, often blending classic suspense story telling techniques with regional themes and literary styles. In Italy, where there's been an explosion of crime fiction lately, Albanian, Serbian and Asian immigrants have started to replace mafia dons as the favorite fictional crime lords. South African crime fiction tends to be noir-tinged and ultraviolent, with nods to the lingering effects of apartheid. Most Swedish crime writing turns on political and social issues (the original Swedish title of Mr. Larsson's "Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" was "Men Who Hate Women"). Latin American crime novels often center on drug trafficking and police corruption; "narco-novels" about drug lords are booming in Mexico.
Some American crime writers are now taking cues from abroad. Best-selling author Michael Connelly says that he's started bringing politics and economic issues into his novels after reading a lot of South African and European crime fiction. He's now working on a novel that touches on the mortgage crisis: an angry homeowner murders the banker who forecloses on her home. "Writers and readers in other countries tend to look at crime novels as social novels," he says.
Much of the crime fiction being imported blurs the line between genre and literary fiction. In Europe, where crime novels take top literary prizes, suspense writing is regarded as a serious literary endeavor rather than a form of mass entertainment. In Japan, top mystery writers Shuichi Yoshida and Keigo Higashino have won multiple literary awards.
Minotaur is betting big on Mr. Higashino with a first print run of 75,000 copies for his novel "The Devotion of Suspect X," which comes out in the U.S. next February.
Keith Kahla, executive editor of St. Martin's Press, described the author as the Japanese equivalent of James Patterson or Stephen King. "He's huge, and he's utterly unknown here," says Mr. Kahla, who had never heard of Mr. Higashino before he was approached by the author's agent. Just one of Mr. Higashino's books, "Naoko," had been previously translated into English and released by a small American literary press in 2004.
"The Devotion of Suspect X" is part of Mr. Higashino's popular "Galileo" series about a university physics professor with an uncanny ability to crack tough murder cases. The five books in the series have sold more than 3.2 million copies in Japan; more than a dozen of Mr. Higashino's books have been adapted into films and TV dramas in Japan. "Suspect X" starts with a murder in a Tokyo apartment complex. A single mother strangles her ex-husband, and her neighbor, a math teacher, helps cover up the crime. A cat-and-mouse game unfolds as the math genius tries to elude the detectives and his old university rival, the physics professor.
The flat, unadorned prose and police-procedural elements of "The Devotion of Suspect X" will likely appeal to fans of American crime fiction, but much about the novel remains particular to Japan, down to the detectives' exceedingly polite interrogation techniques and the murder weapon (the victim is strangled with an electrical cord attached to a kotatsu, a low, heated table common in Japanese households).
"It has a very clean, very primal, and hence very universal setup," Mr. Kahla says of the book's crossover potential.
Pantheon Books has also been snapping up Japanese crime fiction: Pantheon will release Mr. Yoshida's 2007 novel "Villain," a murder-and-manhunt tale set on the coast, this August. In Japan, Mr. Yoshida, 41, has published 10 books -- four have been made into films and television dramas -- and won several major literary awards for his novels, which often feature rootless, lonely characters in their 20s. He has been published elsewhere in Asia and in France but never translated into English before. "Villain" opens with the arrest of a young construction worker for the murder of an insurance saleswoman. The investigation turns up other suspects, and the moody narrative unfolds from multiple characters' perspectives. Pantheon also bought Mr. Yoshida's 2002 novel "Parade," featuring five young Tokyo roommates whose neighborhood is hit by a string of gruesome murders targeting women, which is scheduled for publication in 2012.
The flood of imported crime fiction is striking given American publishers' longstanding resistance to works in translation. Newly translated books still make up just 3% of titles released in the U.S., according to Bowker, a company that tracks the publishing industry, and translated fiction and poetry make up less than 1%. In many European countries, translated books account for 25% to 40% of titles.
A recent string of surprise best sellers has eroded the notion that Americans prefer home-grown authors. A 2008 translation of the French literary novel "The Elegance of the Hedgehog" from Europa Editions, an independent press dedicated to European fiction in translation, sold more than 500,000 copies here; Stieg Larsson's trilogy has sold more than six million copies in the U.S.
As focus shifts toward international hits, American editors who used to rely on international book fairs and pitches from literary agents have gotten more proactive. Some are asking translators to suss out rising literary talents and provide plot synopses for books that are creeping up best-seller lists overseas. Ms. Urban, who represents Japanese author and international literary star Haruki Murakami, learned about Mr. Yoshida's crime novels from Philip Gabriel, Mr. Murakami's American translator.
Carol Janeway, a senior editor and director of international rights at Knopf, tracks rising European literary stars by keeping an eye on Germany, which tends to lead the way in translating literature from other countries. Ms. Janeway, who also translates German novels, discovered Swedish novelists such as Hakan Nesser and Arne Dahl by reading German editions. This February, Pantheon will publish the first novel in Mr. Dahl's popular crime series, which has sold more than two million copies in Europe.
Some small presses have also found that international crime can be profitable. Revenue at Bitter Lemon Press, an international publisher that focuses on translated crime fiction, has grown roughly 12% a year since the imprint was created five years ago, says co-founder Francois von Hurter, who declined to provide overall sales figures. The press's top-selling authors include Italian crime writer Gianrico Carofiglio and Leonardo Padura from Cuba.
In October, New York-based independent press Melville House will launch an imprint devoted to international crime fiction, featuring mostly works in translation. Fall titles include "Cut Throat Dog," a psychological thriller about an ex-Mossad agent by Israeli novelist Joshua Sobol, and "Kismet," a 2007 novel by German writer Jakob Arjouni, whichcenters onan ethnically Turkish private investigator.
Translated fiction is still a hard sell, and many U.S. publishers remain wary. Foreign rights rarely exceed four or five figures, but translating a book can add tens of thousands to production costs. Marketing a book by an unknown author poses challenges, particularly if the writer doesn't speak English.
Publishers seem increasingly willing to gamble, however, especially on Nordic noir. The Stockholm-based Salomonsson Agency, which represents 36 Scandinavian writers, has sold nearly 40 books to U.S. publishers in the last three years, says co-founder Niclas Salomonsson. Twenty-one went to Alfred A. Knopf, which publishes Mr. Larsson and recently signed Jo Nesbo, who was formerly with HarperCollins. This spring, Simon & Schuster's Atria Books paid more than $500,000 for rights to four novels by Swedish crime queen Liza Marklund, whose books have sold 12 million copies world-wide.
Publishers and agents going after the next big thing say the U.S. market for Nordic noir may have reached a saturation point, and are looking farther afield. Kent Wolf of Global Literary Management, an agency that focuses on international fiction, says he's focusing on suspense novels from Asia. Mr. Wolf represents five writers from Asia, including South Korean novelist Young-ha Kim, whose spy thriller "Your Republic Is Calling You," will be published this September by Mariner Books. The novel, a "24"-like thriller, unfolds in a single day and features a North Korean spy who is activated after spending 21 years undercover in South Korea.
The explosion of crime fiction overseas could come at a price for U.S. publishers. Danny Baror, president of Baror International, which sells foreign rights for more than 100 American authors, says his sales have dropped by 25% in Germany and 15% in France and Italy in recent years because publishers there are focused on local writers. His worst market is Scandinavia, where sales have dropped by 90% since 2000: local stars like Mr. Dahl and Ms. Marklund now dominate there.
"We used to sell our entire catalogue in Sweden," Mr. Baror says. "These days, they only buy Robert Ludlum."

Abstract: In his first presidential speech dedicated to the divisive issue, Obama made the case for comprehensive immigration reform that would see undocumented migrants given a pathway to citizenship and further measures put in place to secure the southwestern border. [...] he also turned a spotlight on 11 Republican senators who had backed reform attempts in 2006, arguing that progress is being held hostage by political posturing, special-interest wrangling and . . . the pervasive sentiment in Washington that tackling such a thorny and emotional issue is inherently bad politics.

Full text: President Obama piled new pressure on Republicans on Thursday to support moves to fix an immigration system he said has become "broken and dangerous," but key GOP senators showed little sign of being ready to cooperate.
In his first presidential speech dedicated to the divisive issue, Obama made the case for comprehensive immigration reform that would see undocumented migrants given a pathway to citizenship and further measures put in place to secure the southwestern border.
But he also turned a spotlight on 11 Republican senators who had backed reform attempts in 2006, arguing that progress is being "held hostage" by "political posturing, special-interest wrangling and . . . the pervasive sentiment in Washington that tackling such a thorny and emotional issue is inherently bad politics."
"I'm ready to move, the majority of Democrats are ready to move, and I believe the majority of Americans are ready to move," Obama said in the half-hour speech at American University. "But the fact is that without bipartisan support, as we had just a few years ago, we cannot solve this problem."
Some of the 11 senators whose support is critical to his plans signaled Thursday that they are not ready to back reform this time around. They also denied that they had changed their positions for political reasons.
Laena Fallon, a spokeswoman for Sen. Judd Gregg (N.H.), said the senator is interested in fixing the immigration system. But she added that he had made it clear he "does not support any initiative promoting comprehensive reform until the president and this administration get serious about controlling our borders."
Andy Fisher, a spokesman for Sen. Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), said the senator thinks it is simply the wrong moment for reform. "There really is not the political landscape to proceed with it at this time," he said.
Other minor legislation, designed to legalize those who came to the United States as children and then enrolled in U.S. colleges, "could potentially be doable this year," the spokesman said.
Sen. Robert F. Bennett (Utah) also said further border enforcement had to come first. "The president needs to work with Congress on a step-by-step approach, focusing first on securing our borders and then establishing a temporary worker program," he said.
Other Republicans sympathetic to the cause now have other priorities. Sen. John McCain, a past supporter, faces a tough battle in his Arizona primary. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), who had been working with Democrats on a draft reform bill earlier in the year, has now said that Congress should prioritize other issues such as Wall Street reform.
The president did not outline any details for reform or set a timetable for a reform bill, to the disappointment of those pushing him to fulfill his election pledge to take up the issue early in his first term.
Obama said that "years of patchwork fixes" had led to an immigration system that was creaking, adding that Arizona's new law clamping down on illegal immigration stemmed from the impasse in Congress. But he criticized the law, which gives officers more power to check the status of those suspected of entering the country illegally, as "ill-conceived."
A slim majority of Americans support the Arizona law, according to a Washington Post-ABC poll, but a similar number also still back a program giving those here illegally the right to earn legal documentation.
"The process of who is and who isn't allowed to enter this country and on what terms has always been contentious, and that remains true," Obama told an audience of 250, including lawmakers and reform advocates.
Although Obama said amnesty would be "unwise and unfair," he also said apprehending all undocumented migrants would be impossible in practice. He argued that the border is more secure than at any time in the past 20 years and that reform is needed in other areas now.
"We can create a pathway for legal status that is fair, reflective of our values, and works," he said. "The question now is whether we will have the courage and political will."
Few in Congress see any chance of a bill making headway in an election year. A White House operation has been underway over the past few months to put the ball firmly in the Republicans' court. In April, Obama called sympathetic Republican senators to see whether a deal could be reached. He also spoke at their caucus lunch recently in a bid to round up support.
Obama has also attempted to show a renewed zeal for reform. He met with advocates Monday to talk about his commitment to the issue. In an hour-long meeting Tuesday, the president and a group of Hispanic members of Congress discussed how to proceed.
Hispanics could play an important part in the Democrats' fortunes in the midterm elections. Two-thirds of Hispanic voters backed Obama in 2008.

Full text: Fernando often paints in aggressive charcoal streaks against the canvas, depicting what he sees as a black-and-white world.
Certainly, he sees little gray in his own situation.
He was a promising American art student at one of the city's best high schools, with a partial scholarship to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, when he asked his Mexican parents for his Social Security number so he could apply for federal financial aid.
They told him to sit down in the kitchen of their McKinley Park home.
"You don't have a Social Security number," Fernando said they told him. "You weren't born here."
Like that, he learned he was illegal immigrant and, as such, ineligible for the financial aid he had counted on to matriculate.
School officials say his case is not unusual.
Each year, students in this country illegally who have excelled at high school suddenly run up against the brick wall of their immigration status as they try to figure out how to pay for college.
Schools are not allowed to ask for proof of citizenship. But without a Social Security number, the students cannot fill out the universal form required to apply for federal aid and loans.
Fernando, 18, who spoke on the condition that his last name not be published, was the only illegal immigrant in Lindblom Math & Science Academy's first graduating class in 2009, said Paul Welsh, one of the school's counselors.
This year, the school had at least three other seniors like Fernando in a class of 86.
Welsh and three other counselors have started to confidentially ask early on if students are in this country illegally in order to have more time to work with scholarship providers and colleges to create opportunities.
"I'm watching these kids' future disappear because of the accident of their birth," Welsh said. "I was born a white guy in the United States. These kids are just as qualified as me or anyone else."
Since 2001, legislation that would help college students in this country illegally afford tuition by paving a way toward legal residency has sat idle in Congress, part of the ongoing debate over federal immigration reforms.
But the so-called Dream Act has garnered new attention recently as young adults across the nation have held sit-ins, such as one in Arizona that led to three students getting arrested outside U.S. Sen. John McCain's office, and "coming out" rallies, where they publicly proclaim their status.
Even as their families push them to excel, students in this country illegally say they sometimes want to give up on school when faced with dismal scholarship options and an uncertain future. They are often frustrated to see their peers, who may have lesser academic qualifications and less financial need, throw away opportunities.
"(Fernando's) story is very similar to many other stories I've heard," said Nilda Flores-Gonzalez, associate professor of sociology and Latino studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago. "There are a lot of young, undocumented students who are faced with the same situation."
About 65,000 children who have lived in the United States illegally for five years or longer graduate from high school each year, according to a 2009 report by The College Board, a not-for-profit that aims to connect students to college opportunities.
While Chicago Public Schools officials said that they were anecdotally aware of illegal immigrants in their schools, they do not track them.
CPS spokeswoman Monique Bond said in an e-mail that Chicago schools with high immigrant populations have started fundraising fairs and partnerships with community agencies to help create more options for these students.
At Hancock College Preparatory High School near Midway Airport, where 15 percent -- or 30 -- seniors this year are in the country illegally, officials have held carwashes and cookouts to help them attend college.
"We are actively trying to manage this situation," said Principal Pam Glynn. "We are all about changing the landscape and leveling the playing field."
At Spry Community Links High School in Little Village, about 10 percent of the 150 students do not have Social Security numbers.
"Valedictorians are typically undocumented students," said Principal Francisco Borras.
High school officials said some colleges, such as Dominican University, a Catholic institution in River Forest, are friendlier than others in trying to help them.
"Our admissions counselors are experienced at working with undocumented students to help them find scholarship sources," said Glenn Hamilton, assistant vice president of undergraduate enrollment, in an e-mail. "We also help undocumented students choose courses that will transfer easily to other institutions."
Hamilton said his school has been informally keeping track of accepted students who did not fill out federal forms for student aid, which require a Social Security number.
"We believe that an increasing number of undocumented students are applying to Dominican each year," Hamilton added.
Fernando, who left Mexico at age 2, considers Chicago his hometown.
He was devastated when his parents told him he was in the U.S. illegally.
"I was just scared and shocked and I didn't know what to do or say," Fernando said.
He has not told most of his friends of his status, for fear that they will treat him differently.
Lindblom art teacher Michelle Wielgosz said that after the news, Fernando's plans for college came to a standstill.
Then, something even worse happened: He stopped painting.
"Every day, coming to school, he would hear classmates with worse grades going to better schools. Two people in his art class that couldn't draw got more scholarships," Wielgosz said. "We stopped talking about college in class because of him."
Then, Wielgosz made a decision. She would take her extra money from coaching soccer and pay for Fernando's classes at Harold Washington College.
Fernando pays her back on a monthly basis, working as a dishwasher at a restaurant and helping his father clean heaters.
"His parents couldn't afford it, and I knew it," she said. "I just see a future in him."
The Art Institute is still Fernando's dream school.
While officials with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago declined to comment on Fernando's situation, they said that citizenship "has no bearing on admission decisions."
Fernando is taking the summer off from school to work multiple jobs to help his family but plans to return to a full college semester in the fall -- including two art classes.
Most weeks, Wielgosz gives Fernando feedback on his paintings to help him build a stronger portfolio, a step closer to his goal of one day becoming an art teacher.
On a recent morning, Wielgosz critiqued Fernando's self-portrait, painted from a mirror in his room.
Wielgosz coached him on where his light source comes in, what to do about negative space and incorporating his furniture in the background.
"The sketching is good, ready to go," his teacher said. "You know where your forms are at."
Wielgosz told Fernando to stop outlining his paintings.
"Life is not outlined," she told him.

Full text: Correction: A July 2 editorial on the life of William L. Taylor incorrectly said he was executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. He was a vice chair of the organization, which in January became the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. (Published 7/3/2010)
BILL TAYLOR was not one of those bold-face Washington names -- except to those in the civil rights movement. If you were in that movement, you probably knew William L. Taylor, who died Monday at the age of 78; and if you didn't know him, you certainly knew what he had accomplished.
For more than half a century, Mr. Taylor was at the center of every major civil rights battle. As a young lawyer at the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, he wrote the Supreme Court brief in Cooper v. Aaron, the case in which the justices insisted that the Little Rock schools be desegregated notwithstanding massive local resistance. He worked not only to pass the landmark civil rights statutes of the 1960s -- the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 -- but to ensure their extension and rewriting in the face of hostile Supreme Court decisions in the following decades. He focused particularly on school desegregation -- most notably negotiating a voluntary desegregation plan for St. Louis schools -- and ensuring educational opportunity for students in impoverished areas, a passion that led him to join forces with the Bush administration in writing the No Child Left Behind law. In his various roles, as general counsel and staff director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, as executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, as a law professor and private practitioner, Mr. Taylor was, in the words of the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, "a long-distance runner on the road to justice."
The Brooklyn-born son of Lithuanian immigrants, Mr. Taylor wrote in his memoir, "The Passion of My Times," that he turned up for work at the Legal Defense and Education Fund fresh out of Yale Law School "with virtually no interaction with African Americans. Jackie Robinson provided my only civil rights education." But his passion for civil rights, like his passions for baseball and jazz, never waned. His funeral Wednesday featured repeated references to Mr. Taylor's strong, sometimes prickly, personality. "He was never afraid to share his side of the argument -- whether or not you wanted to hear it," his 13-year-old granddaughter, Simone, wrote in a memoir read at the service. "He knew when to take a stand, and he knew when to hammer out a compromise with integrity," said Rabbi David Saperstein, a longtime colleague.
"The strange thing about working in civil rights is that you always feel that you are stuck in a period of great difficulty," Mr. Taylor said in a 1999 interview with the D.C. Bar magazine. "There was tremendous resistance to the Brown decision, and then we went through all of the tumultuous violence of the 1960s. There were times when it felt very grave, ugly and hateful. But every few years you look up and realize that things have changed in fundamental ways." Mr. Taylor helped bring about that fundamental change.

Full text: Ben Sonnenberg, 73, a onetime wild child of privilege who used his inheritance and eclectic taste to build Grand Street, the literary magazine he founded and edited during the 1980s, into one of the nation's most respected small journals, died June 24 at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He had complications from multiple sclerosis.
Mr. Sonnenberg was the son of Benjamin Sonnenberg, a Russian immigrant who came to the United States as a boy and became an influential publicist with clients such as CBS, Pan American World Airways and Philip Morris.
The elder Sonnenberg was a prodigious art collector whose 37-room Manhattan mansion was furnished like a museum and attended by a small army of servants. For Mr. Sonnenberg, it was not a warm place to grow up. In his 1991 memoir, "Lost Property: Memoirs and Confessions of a Bad Boy," he recalled a relationship with his father characterized by mutual contempt.
"He described his business as 'making giant plinths for little men to stand on,' " Mr. Sonnenberg wrote. "In fact, his clients were often large powerful corporations, and his services to them were different from the flackery which his description implies, more commonplace, more corrupt."
The younger Sonnenberg was as undisciplined as his father was ambitious. Expelled from several prep schools, the self-described "self-exiled son of a self-made man" moved to Europe, where he lived the life of a bohemian dandy on the easy flow of family money.
He read widely, wrote several plays and worked briefly for the CIA. He befriended British poet Ted Hughes and other members of the European arts and letters scene, including Samuel Beckett and composer Elisabeth Lutyens. He also devoted considerable energy to romancing women, once seducing a woman by pretending to be the editor of a literary quarterly.
"It was a pleasure when I lived in England to feel I belonged to a tradition of scapegrace heirs," he said in 1991. "With me it conditioned everything, and made me prefer to do nothing rather than come to any sort of public attention."
Then, when Mr. Sonnenberg was 34, came a stumble, a fall in the street and a diagnosis: multiple sclerosis. The freewheeling Casanova needed a stick, then two canes, then a wheelchair. He became bedridden; his paralysis spread.
In 1978, his father died and left directions to sell his Gramercy Park home and its contents. Mr. Sonnenberg decided to use the windfall to start Grand Street.
"Lifelong habits of reading and writing, of maintaining cross opinions, together with a too-long-suppressed wish to teach and entertain, made starting a literary magazine a natural, perhaps inescapable, choice," he wrote in his autobiography.
"I was also bored of my attitudes of fastidious disengagement. Reading books, buying art, writing unproduced plays, seducing women: not much of a life."
Working out of his apartment on Manhattan's West Side, Mr. Sonnenberg published the first issue of the magazine in 1981 with contributions from writers such as Hughes and Canadian short story author Alice Munro. He embraced the work of known names, such as W.S. Merwin, Norman Mailer and Raymond Carver, and promoted new talents, including novelist and short story writer Susan Minot.
Mr. Sonnenberg wanted "to follow the model that the New Yorker once provided and fell away from -- to be informative and insolent," he said in 1985. He curated each issue to satisfy his own predilections.
"It's a matter of my pulses racing when I see something," he told the Boston Globe in 1990.
Over the years, Mr. Sonnenberg printed Beckett's last poem, a scathingly critical article about the New York Times by former staff reporter John L. Hess and pieces by Christopher Hitchens on the 1956 Suez Canal crisis and Louis Farrakhan.
"It was one of the choicest places to be published," said Merwin, who was named U.S. poet laureate this week. "And the marvelous thing is that there was no formula or pattern to it. So many magazines after a while are predictable in a way, and Grand Street never was, and it was all Ben's idiosyncratic taste and choices."
The magazine's cultural footprint was much larger than its small circulation suggested. In an unsigned review of the winter 1985 issue, The Washington Post called Grand Street among the three or four best literary journals in the country.
"As a literary magazine editor myself," George Plimpton of the Paris Review wrote in 1991, "I was always slightly envious of Grand Street when a new issue appeared with its startlingly eclectic contents."
Mr. Sonnenberg's failing health forced him to sell Grand Street in 1990 to Jean Stein, heir to the MCA entertainment conglomerate fortune. The magazine ceased publishing in 2004.
Mr. Sonnenberg was twice married and divorced, to Wendy Adler and Susan de Verges. Survivors include his wife, writer Dorothy Gallagher of Manhattan; two daughters from his first marriage, Emma Snowdon-Jones of Manhattan and Susanna Sonnenberg of Missoula, Mont.; a daughter from his second marriage, Saidee Brown of Kingston, N.Y.; a sister; and five grandchildren.
Mr. Sonnenberg's 1991 memoir was well received by critics, who called it an unflinchingly honest account by a man who'd found his life's work late.
"Its style is just right: darting, anecdotal, slightly bemused, possessing a lilting irony that makes for compulsive readability. There's also something funny, sexy or shocking on every page," The Post's Michael Dirda wrote. "In short, this 'bad boy' has been a rake, a wastrel, a social parasite. And, it turns out, a brilliant autobiographer."

Full text: In his first major speech on the issue since taking office, President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. immigration system "offends our most basic American values" and blamed Republican opposition for thwarting critically needed change.
It was the third time in as many days that Obama singled out Republicans as an obstructionist force, blaming them in his earlier appearances for defending BP in the aftermath of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and for opposing stronger financial regulatory legislation.
The president's remarks this week represented the clearest preview yet of the message the White House intends to highlight in this year's midterm election: stubborn Republican refusal to help solve national problems.
The theme appeared to galvanize many supporters of immigration legislation who were in the audience at American University. "I think it was a clarion call," said Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. "He implied, 'The ball is in your court.' "
Republicans shot back with a sizzling critique of the president's position, dismissing Obama's argument that the U.S.-Mexico border was more secure now than in years.
"Half a million people still illegally enter our country today, most through Arizona, and his administration has yet to lay out a strategy on how it intends to bring it under control," said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.
The immigration debate has been fueled by passage of an Arizona law that allows police to question those they suspect of being illegal immigrants after a lawful stop. The Obama administration is expected to announce soon that it will file a legal challenge to that law.
Speaking to religious and political activists, Obama in his speech recalled congressional steps toward immigration restructuring under former President George W. Bush, when a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers supported a comprehensive solution.
"Unfortunately, reform has been held hostage to political posturing and special-interest wrangling," Obama said. "Now, under the pressures of partisanship and election-year politics, many of the 11 Republican senators who voted for reform in the past have now backed away from their previous support."
Nonetheless, Obama offered no new solutions, timetables or points of compromise. Instead he outlined a long-standing prescription for reform that, in addition to having no support from Republicans in Congress, also has failed to unite his fellow Democrats.
Some activists had asked the president to speak at Ellis Island, the historic New York entry port, on the Fourth of July. But Obama chose to deliver his immigration address ahead of the Independence Day weekend and before a crowd at American University.
In that sense, it was an innately political speech, aimed via television at a Latino and Democratic audience vital to the Democratic strategy in this fall's elections.
"Latinos are a key part of the equation," Eliseo Medina, international executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, said after the address. "We're going to make a difference in Nevada, Arizona, Texas, California and Florida. So in many ways, the Republicans are playing with fire. Hopefully they'll get that message."
Some immigration advocates who have criticized Obama in the past for not treating the immigration issue with sufficient urgency said they were happy to see him devote a national speech to the subject, even if he made no commitment to pass a bill this year.
Obama's address was closely watched around the country. In Los Angeles, about two dozen workers, students and advocates gathered at a community center to listen.
Olga Gonzalez, 42, said she is frustrated that an overhaul hasn't been enacted and is skeptical that that will happen in 2010.
"He said in his first year he would do it and he didn't," she said. "Now the November elections are coming."

Full text: Shortly after Nicolas Sarkozy was elected French president in 2007, he met German leader Angela Merkel at an aircraft factory in Toulouse to resolve a Franco-German spat over who should run Airbus, the European plane maker.
Mr. Sarkozy joked that he and Ms. Merkel would make a good management team. "You could look after the details," he said, according to people present. Ms. Merkel responded with a quip of her own: "And you could look after marketing."
The encounter set the tenor for what both sides acknowledge has been a rocky relationship between the leaders of the European Union's dominant powers. Europe's debt crisis is exacerbating the tension, as the indefatigable French president's grand designs have run into the austere chancellor's doubts about the small print.
Europe's "opposite twins," as Mr. Sarkozy sometimes calls his country and Germany, are on different sides of crucial issues in Europe's debate over its economic future, from how best to encourage growth to how to tackle rising public debts.
The leaders have clashed recently on bailouts for Greece, the independence of the European Central Bank, and what shape a new "economic government" for Europe proposed by France should take.
In June, the two sides even quarreled over who was to blame for the last-minute cancellation of a meeting in Berlin that was supposed to clear the air.
Little unites the pair right now apart from sinking authority at home. Mr. Sarkozy's approval rating hit a new low of 26% in an opinion poll by TNS-Sofres released Thursday, amid discontent over ministerial scandals and pension overhauls.
Ms. Merkel, who has also been plumbing new lows in the polls, suffered a revolt on Wednesday by party colleagues who voted against her candidate for German president. She prevailed, but the rebellion underscored dismay in Germany over her leadership and handling of the Greek debt crisis.
Political elites in both countries worry that the prickly atmosphere will complicate efforts to repair flaws in the euro zone's structure, laid bare by the debt crisis.
"Europe cannot move ahead without the Franco-German engine," former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing told a debate at the German embassy in Paris recently.
Close personal bonds and a sense of sharing a historical mission have underpinned Franco-German friendship since the early 1960s, when Germany's Konrad Adenauer and France's Charles de Gaulle buried an enmity that helped trigger two world wars. In the 1980s, their successors Francois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl held hands at Verdun, scene of the countries' bloodiest battle in World War I, and a few years later they agreed to merge their currencies.
The two countries often disagreed on economics and other matters despite their postwar rapprochement. But their alliance was rooted in an overriding political will to reconcile their points of view -- and in a belief that Franco-German compromises were the key to wider European agreements.
That political will and sense of mission have faded along with the generation of politicians who experienced World War II. With the war receding into history books, Germany has lost its reluctance to assert its national interests, including financial ones.
No longer does Germany happily defer to, and use its economic muscle to pay for, French political priorities that once led Gen. de Gaulle to quip that Germany was the horse and France the jockey.
"Everybody in France agrees that Germany is becoming an ordinary country, where 'the European interest' is no longer the default mode," says Francois Heisbourg, special adviser at the Foundation for Strategic Research, a Paris-based think tank. "It is inevitable, and worrying about it is like worrying about the rain."
Against this new political backdrop, the awkward personal chemistry between Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Merkel is further complicating the relationship.
The ebullient Mr. Sarkozy, known in France as "le Lapin Duracell," equivalent to the "Energizer Bunny," bombards fellow leaders with initiatives and often announces breakthroughs before deals are sealed.
The cautious Ms. Merkel, known in European Union circles as "Madame Non," admits she likes to make decisions only after lengthy study of all facets of an issue.
On paper, they have much in common.
Both are 55 years old and outsiders in their respective political systems. Mr. Sarkozy, partly descended from Hungarian and Sephardic Jewish immigrants, didn't graduate from the elite universities that produce most of France's leaders, and vowed on his election to shake up France's stodgy economy.
Ms. Merkel grew up in Communist East Germany and entered politics only after German unification, becoming the female, protestant, centrist head of a male- and Catholic-dominated conservative party.
That's where the similarities end. After his election, the Rolex-wearing Frenchman threw a glitzy party on the Champs-Elysees, vacationed on a billionaire friend's yacht, and married the Italian singer and former supermodel Carla Bruni.
Ms. Merkel is married to a physics professor, and wrote her Ph.D thesis on the mechanisms and speed constants of atomic-decay reactions "on the basis of quantum-chemical and statistical methods."
Her advisers struggled for years before she became chancellor to get her to restyle her pageboy haircut and frumpy clothes. She insisted policies matter, not appearances. She toasted the 2005 coalition pact that made her chancellor with mineral water.
Mr. Sarkozy grew irritated with Berlin within weeks of taking power. At a 2007 EU meeting in Brussels attended by the French president, Ms. Merkel's then-finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, criticized France's loose fiscal policies.
"I won't allow you to talk to me like that," Mr. Sarkozy said, outraged that a minister dared lecture him, according to people present. He later demanded that Ms. Merkel forbid her underlings from criticizing him, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Merkel replied that her minister had spoken for the German government.
Soon, the French president launched an idea for a "Mediterranean Union," a club of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea under de facto French leadership.
The proposal irked Ms. Merkel, who wasn't consulted, because it left aside Germany and the EU, which already had its own cooperation program for the Mediterranean region. After months of argument, Mr. Sarkozy gave in to German objections. "I think I made an effort to understand her concerns," Mr. Sarkozy said at a joint press conference with Ms. Merkel in March 2008.
Despite such public pronouncements, the strains remained.
In private, Ms. Merkel, who has a dry sense of humor, has amused fellow German politicians by imitating Mr. Sarkozy's twitchy body language when he is agitated.
In her quest to understand the Frenchman's mentality, the chancellor, acting on an aide's recommendation, watched movies starring Louis de Funes, a madcap 1960s French comedian whose trademark was to throw vanity-driven tantrums.
In Paris, Mr. Sarkozy sometimes referred to the German chancellor as the "woman from the East" during cabinet meetings, a spokesman let slip. Aides to the president say he was often frustrated because Ms. Merkel didn't show enthusiasm for his initiatives.
Yet both sides still viewed the Franco-German relationship as crucial to any agreement in the EU. Mr. Sarkozy launched a charm offensive.
In May 2008 Ms. Merkel received the prestigious Charlemagne Award for services to Europe, after she brokered a solution on the EU's stalled new constitution. Mr. Sarkozy delivered an effusive tribute, saying: "I love Angela Merkel -- much more than people say."
Mr. Sarkozy said he worked so closely with the chancellor that he perhaps saw her more often than her own husband, Joachim Sauer -- whom he called "Monsieur Merkel," and congratulated on his wife. "I thank you, dear Nicolas, with all my heart," Ms. Merkel replied in French.
The love-in didn't last. The global banking crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 led to new tiffs between Berlin and Paris, after Mr. Sarkozy proposed a collective EU bailout of the European banking system. Ms. Merkel vetoed that, insisting that each nation support its own banks.
The disagreement reflected a long-brewing change in Germany's attitude towards Europe: The EU's biggest economy was becoming fed up with its role as Europe's paymaster. Years of painful economic overhauls in Germany had boosted the country's finances and industry.
German public opinion was against shelling out hard-saved cash to prop up neighboring countries which Germans felt hadn't bothered to reform themselves.
Ms. Merkel, who used Germany's checkbook to solve an EU budget dispute earlier in her term, now cast herself as protector of the German purse. France found itself increasingly faced with a German veto on its European initiatives.
In November 2008 Mr. Sarkozy again wooed Ms. Merkel, with an invitation to breakfast at Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy's chic apartment in Paris' exclusive 16th arrondissement. Ms. Merkel expressed her appreciation as the president's glamorous wife served foie gras and fresh baguettes.
"I knew you would like it!," exclaimed an exuberant Mr. Sarkozy, who had chosen the menu himself, according to a person familiar with the matter.
But Ms. Merkel didn't swallow Mr. Sarkozy's proposals for a collective EU fiscal stimulus.
Later the same day, the president's impatience showed through when the two leaders held a press conference at the Elysee Palace. Asked about stimulus measures, he said: "France is working on it, Germany is thinking about it."
A stoical Ms. Merkel, standing next to him, said: "We must be careful that we don't get ahead of ourselves."
Germany eventually enacted a big stimulus in 2009, later than other major economies including France and the U.S., but tensions over Germany's persistently weak domestic demand and reliance on exports remained.
Again the two leaders tried to make nice. At a summit in Pittsburgh last year of the Group of 20 leading economies, Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Merkel chatted on the sidelines. The chancellor said she might copy the president's tactic of recruiting opposition politicians to his cabinet.
Mr. Sarkozy said he was trying to become a calmer, less highly-strung person, according to people who were present.
"I'm morphing into a German Sarkozy," she said, according to aides who were present.
"And I'm Merkelizing myself," he replied.
The two governments began discussing a program to deepen their ties, called "Agenda 2020". But Mr. Sarkozy's desire for symbolism foundered on Ms. Merkel's practical objections.
At a dinner in Berlin last year, Mr. Sarkozy enthused about creating a minister who would be a member of both countries' cabinets. Ms. Merkel was politely non-committal. The idea eventually died. By early this year, the Agenda 2020 consisted of more modest plans, such as opening bilingual kindergartens.
This spring's Greek debt crisis took Franco-German tensions to a new level.
Ms. Merkel, whose electorate strongly opposed bailing out the Greeks, blocked French-backed EU proposals to give Greece more than vague verbal support. When the chancellor finally agreed to rescue Greece, she insisted on involving the International Monetary Fund.
That was anathema to Mr. Sarkozy, who wanted an EU-only solution to show what Europe can do. As it happens, the IMF is headed by a rival, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is considering running against Mr. Sarkozy for the French presidency in 2012. But Mr. Sarkozy had to bow to Germany's financial clout.
The French leader saw his chance to make a mark on May 7, at an EU summit that took place amid a worsening rout of Southern European debt in bond markets. His proposal: The EU should wow financial markets that same day, by announcing a massive bailout fund, big enough to save any struggling euro-zone country.
Mr. Sarkozy arrived early at the Brussels summit and swept in and out of meetings with euro-zone leaders, building support, an entourage of photographers and camera crews in tow.
But Ms. Merkel threw the cameras out of their meeting room, saying: "I'm not going to let you cast me as the stubborn old bag," according to a senior official present.
The barely containable president pressed her for a decision. "We must act," he said: "This is the moment of truth," according to people who were present. These people say Ms. Merkel probed Mr. Sarkozy for details of how the aid fund would work and, finding them hazy, blocked a deal until finance ministers could negotiate them two days later.
Mr. Sarkozy addressed the world media on May 7, claiming he had imposed his will "95%." Ms. Merkel left the summit discreetly. After round-the-clock haggling, the EU agreed on a 750 billion euro ($917 billion) rescue fund on May 9, but under strict terms laid down by Germany.

AGRICULTURE; Farmworker overtime bill passes; The Assembly sends the measure to the governor's office, where it faces an uncertain fate.

Abstract: Giving farmworkers the same decades-old right to overtime after an eight-hour day that is given to supermarket clerks, construction workers, gardeners and even farm-related jobs such as fruit and vegetable packers is long overdue, proponents in the Assembly debate contended.

Full text: The state Assembly, in a historic vote Thursday, passed and sent to the governor a bill to give California farmworkers the same rights to overtime pay that millions of other hourly employees have.
People who work at one of the most difficult, dangerous and injury-prone jobs -- picking vegetables, fruit and nuts -- shouldn't be discriminated against when they spend more than eight hours a day in the field, argued Sen. Dean Florez, the bill's author as well as the son and grandson of Kern County farmworkers.
In a lengthy debate that covered human rights and economics, opponents countered that increasing pay would hurt the state's $36 billion-a-year agriculture industry, whose farmers sometimes operate on slim profit margins, and their employees, who probably would wind up with a pay cut.
Florez's bill passed on a 46-26 vote but faces an uncertain fate with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. The former movie action hero from Austria and onetime bricklayer has a mixed record on agricultural labor issues.
He has signed into law a bill to prevent field workers from being poisoned by pesticides and backed regulations to protect them against heatstroke. He also has vetoed bills opposed by agribusiness that would have made it easier for unions to organize in the fields.
"I am hopeful that the governor's experience as an immigrant who initially supported himself through manual labor will give him empathy to grasp the importance of this bill to some of California's hardest workers," said Florez, a Democrat from Shafter.
The governor, who leaves office in January, has not made up his mind on the bill, a spokesman said.
Florez, who also is being forced out by term limits after 10 years in the Legislature, hopes passage of the overtime bill will be his career capper.
He said he plans to personally lobby the governor for a signature.
If that doesn't work, Florez said he would seek support from California First Lady Maria Shriver and other members of her Kennedy family.
Both of Shriver's late uncles, former U.S. Sens. Robert Kennedy and Ted Kennedy, were close to Cesar Chavez, the founder of the United Farm Workers union, and they fervently supported farmworker causes.
"It's a profile-in-courage moment for the governor," said Florez, referring to "Profiles in Courage," a 1955 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography written by then U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy, who won the presidency five years later.
Schwarzenegger's endorsement of overtime would reverse a 1941 state law exempting agricultural employees from being paid one and one-half times their normal hourly rate after they work more than eight hours in a day.
That exemption was partially modified in 1976 when the Industrial Welfare Commission ordered overtime pay after 10 hours on the job and for all work on the seventh day of a week after putting in six straight days of 10 hours or more.
Giving farmworkers the same decades-old right to overtime after an eight-hour day that is given to supermarket clerks, construction workers, gardeners and even farm-related jobs such as fruit and vegetable packers is long overdue, proponents in the Assembly debate contended. Some Latino lawmakers, who backed Florez's SB 1121, recalled that they picked crops as youths alongside their farmworker parents.
"This is a vote for fairness," said Assemblywoman Mariko Yamada (D-Davis), whose Yolo County district includes UC Davis, the state's top agricultural school, and hundreds of large and small farms.
"It's a vote," she said, "to restore some semblance of justice to this population of laborers who have been excluded from overtime protections since the 1940s."
Supporters' concern for the welfare of farmworkers is misplaced, said Republican lawmakers from California's agriculture-rich Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys.
"This bill is not a big pain for agriculture. We'll deal with it. It's no big deal. We'll run larger crews," said Assemblyman Bill Berryhill, who grows grapes near Ceres in Stanislaus County.
"The people this bill hurts are the very people it's intended to help," the Republican said. "It will reduce pay by an average of 20% to 30% for most farmworkers."
Farmers, who need to bring in perishable crops quickly to get them to market, probably won't replace experienced farmworkers just to save a couple of hours of overtime pay, said Assemblyman William Monning (D-Monterey), a former attorney for the United Farm Workers union.
"When you have a skilled crew working eight hours a day," he said, "you're not going to bring in another unskilled crew" to replace them.

Abstract: NORMAN ROCKWELL FROM THE COLLECTIONS OF GEORGE LUCAS AND STEVEN SPIELBERG Rockwell paintings collected by the two filmmakers, indefinitely at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Eighth and F streets NW. The exhibition draws on graphic images, film, costumes, music scores, playbills, instruments and artist interviews to explore the Apollo Theater's impact on American popular culture and how African American culture shaped the nation. The definition of freedom outlined in the Declaration of Independence serves as the starting point for this collection of works by the descendants of the Russian czars, Iroquois Indians, French revolutionaries and Guantanamo Bay detainees.

Full text: A last major piece of the state's anti-illegal immigration law took effect as small businesses became subject to fines and shutdowns for employing illegal workers.
Employers must check new hires' legal status and fire workers known to be in the U.S. illegally. The law has applied to larger companies for a year.
Violators face fines of up to $1,000 per worker, and a business can be closed for months for repeat offenses.

Full text: President Obama hailed yesterday's jobs report for June as more evidence that "we're headed in the right direction," and with any more such good news the U.S. economy will soon be where Japan was in its lost growth decade of the 1990s. If we're lucky.
The reality is that this is another disappointing jobs report at a time in the recovery when new hiring ought to be picking up. Economic growth turned positive about a year ago, and normal recoveries become self-sustaining: Job creation follows the pickup in growth, which means rising income, which leads to more consumer spending, which leads to more business confidence and investment, and even more job creation.
This jobs recovery seems stuck in the Washington mud. The decline in the headline unemployment rate to 9.5% from 9.7% is welcome news, as is the continued gain in manufacturing (9,000 jobs, and 136,000 since last December). However, the labor force shrank again by some 652,000 following a 322,000 decline in May. The average hours worked per week fell to 34.1 from 34.2, when employers should be adding to worker shifts given the big gains in productivity.
After some healthy gains earlier this year, private hiring has been barely positive in the last two months, up 33,000 in May and 83,000 in June. (Census hiring of temporary workers fell by a net 225,000.) A useful rule of thumb is that roughly 150,000 new jobs are needed each month to keep up with normal growth in the labor market to accommodate young entrants and immigrants. To get the jobless rate down even to 8% will require 250,000 new jobs a month for the next three years.
Private employers appear to be in a holding pattern, waiting on hiring decisions until they see how much more the political class will raise their costs. A pair of recent reports by the Business Roundtable and the Manufacturers Alliance have warned about the destructive impact that higher taxes, trade restrictions and more regulation, among other policies, are having on job creation and new investment.
Meanwhile, Washington continues to believe its own advertising that government spending creates growth. Speaker Nancy Pelosi asserted this week that another extension of jobless benefits will cause more people to work, and Mr. Obama responded to a question in Wisconsin about job creation by saying that he wants to create a new tax break for Americans to weatherize their homes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Their worst critics couldn't make this up.

Full text: Author: Josh Barbanel
Luna Park, a large co-op in Coney Island in need of urgent building repairs, had been threatening to drop out of a state housing program for middle-income residents and to convert to market-rate apartments.
Instead, the board of Luna Park, a development with 1,576 units in five megalithic towers, closed on a $47 million bank loan on Monday.
It was the last piece of an aid package that also includes commitments for $21 million in government grants and loans for the complex that will eventually be forgiven.
As part of the funding package--worked out after months of negotiations involving city, state and federal officials--Luna Park agreed to remain in the state's Mitchell-Lama program for at least another 20 years, with incentives to remain an additional 10 years.
The $21 million in public grants and loans is one of the largest direct subsidies to be provided to a Mitchell-Lama project, city officials said.
But it was never really clear that Luna Park was in a position to withdraw from the program. Although the co-op's board prepared a plan for withdrawal, a lawyer familiar with the complex said that Luna Park faced legal roadblocks that could have prevented the change until at least 2017.
About a decade ago, engineers discovered that the facades of the buildings, built in the early 1960s, were failing. Since then, the complex--which is home to 5,000 people, mostly immigrants from Russia--have been struggling to find a way to fund repairs.
The funding package will be used to strip off all the bricks from the buildings and replace them.
New windows and roofs will also be installed. The co-op board said that because of the large grants, the repair work won't require any increase in co-op charges.
"They used their moxie, their chutzpa, their belief in the American way," said Adam Leitman Bailey, the Luna Park board's attorney, "as well as political skills honed back in Russia."
The unusual funding deal shows both the importance the Bloomberg administration has placed on preserving affordable housing, and how effective a concerted lobbying effort by a large swarm of constituents can sometimes be.
Eric Bederman, a spokesman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said that deal was a good one for the city, which has been working to maintain and expand the supply of housing for people on limited incomes. He said that 30% of the families at Luna Park had very low incomes of less than $23,000 for a family of four.
While Luna Park struggled to develop a plan to fix the problem, alarms were being sounded across the city over the efforts of other Mitchell-Lama developments to leave the program to take advantage of then-rising property values.
City officials say that so far New York has lost 18,000 affordable apartments in 60 Mitchell-Lama developments, and they were working to stem further losses.
A few years ago, the private owners of Brooklyn's Starrett City, the largest federally subsidized development in the country, tried to sell it for $1.3 billion, a move that was eventually blocked by federal housing officials.
Instead city, state and federal officials developed a plan to keep Starrett City in the middle-income housing programs. The government provided a $513 million refinancing, which allowed Starrett City's owners to take $200 million in profit out of the project.
At Luna Park, board members and their lawyers began having weekly meetings with elected officials and discussed their plans to withdraw from the Mitchell-Lama program.
Eventually, the elected officials began searching for funding sources to help.
The city agreed to convert a debt of about $5 million into a forgivable loan, and provided $9 million in direct aid, including $1 million provided through the intervention of the local City Council member, Domenic M. Recchia Jr.
State Sen. Diane J. Savino agreed to find state funds for $1 million. U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler found federal funds to provide $2 million, and Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz provided $2 million in city funding commitments. The total in direct aid: $21 million.
In the meantime, Luna Park is still seeking additional help from elected officials, and even from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Anna Treybich, vice president of the co-op, said the board was seeking $1 million through a local assemblyman for a new security system. In addition the board has filed a complaint about subway-car noise from elevated tracks renovated two years ago that curve around Luna Park.
"We want them to pay for double-paned windows," she said.
Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the transit authority, noted, however, that the subways had been there since 1918, long before Luna Park.

Full text: Dorothee E. Krahn, 88, who escaped Nazi Germany as a teenager and became a mathematician for several U.S. government agencies, died of metastatic breast cancer June 26 at an assisted living facility in Tiverton, R.I.
Dr. Krahn had been a resident of Silver Spring for more than 50 years before moving to Rhode Island in 2008.
Her career began in the early 1950s at the University of Maryland's mathematics department. She then worked for several years in the mathematical analysis division of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory before continuing her career as a statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, from which she retired in 1986.
Dorothee Einstein was born in Offenbach, Germany, the only child in a middle-class Jewish family.
In her self-published memoir of her early life, "Am I a Holocaust Survivor?," she describes her parents' insistence that she learn English from a family friend so that she might find refuge from the increasingly harsh Nazi oppression of German Jews before World War II.
She fled in 1938 via the Kindertransport program, which took her to England; her parents joined her there the next year.
She received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and Latin from Birkbeck College, University of London, in 1942.
In 1952, she married a fellow mathematician, Edgar Krahn, a native of Estonia. They came to the United States the following year.
She received a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Maryland in 1971.
Dr. Krahn enjoyed classical music and opera. As an adult, she learned to play the cello and played in the Montgomery Symphony and chamber groups well into her 80s.
She also studied at the Writer's Center in Bethesda and translated two books from German to English. She endowed scholarships in the music and mathematics departments at U-Md.
Her first husband died in 1961. A second marriage, to Richard Vogt, ended in divorce.
Survivors include two children from her first marriage, Thomas A. Krahn of Barrington, R.I., and Karen Krahn Stodola of Woodinville, Wash.; and four grandchildren.

Full text: President Obama is at his oratorical best when hewing to a middle path on the complex, divisive issues confronting the nation: race, healthcare and, now, immigration. In his first major speech on immigration, delivered at American University on Thursday, he analyzed the broken, irrational system that hobbles the country's economy, threatens its security and tears at its social fabric. Then he described how to fix it. He called on the U.S. to reaffirm its identity as a nation of immigrants. The genius of America, Obama said, is not passed down by birthright or heredity;its power is that of a magnet, attracting likeminded people from around the world who yearn for opportunity.
To those who maintain that "sealing" the border must come before other reform measures, as if the Mexican border is a Ziploc bag and not 1,930 miles of often rugged terrain, he explained that the internal and external pressures that encourage illegal immigration must be addressed to be successful. That means taking steps to end the bureaucratic backlog that leaves eligible people waiting for years to reunite with family members; supplying work visas more easily to those who have the promise of employment; and requiring employers to verify the legal status of workers. And we need to bring 11 million illegal immigrants out of the shadow economy. Yes, this is a nation of laws, he said, but no, we do not have the economic or logistical wherewithal to deport them all -- nor is it the right thing to do. Better to have them admit their wrongdoing, pay taxes and fines, and learn English.
There was sobering prose along with the poetry. Obama acknowledged the impossibility of fixing the system without bipartisan support. "Reform that brings accountability to our immigration system cannot pass without Republican votes. That is the political and mathematical reality," he said. He's right. But if reform is vital, then it is not enough to chide recalcitrant Republicans. After all, Democrats are not eager to undertake reform either -- it would be political suicide before the midterm elections.
Obama can lead. Arizona's polarizing new anti-immigrant law, which by month's end will encourage police to ethnically profile people in an effort to rid the state of illegal immigrants, should be overturned. The administration is expected to file suit against the state, and it should. Obama can also urge Congress to take up measures that have bipartisan support, such as the DREAM Act, which would allow undocumented students conditional citizenship if they go to college or into the armed services. The president's speech was a good beginning, a welcome note of civility in the ugly immigration debate. Now we need to see him turn eloquence into action.

Full text: ALEXANDRIA, Egypt
FROM his pulpit at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, Ismail Serageldin preaches what might be called Islamic liberalism, a philosophical view grounded in reason and tolerance with roots in the early days of his faith, when Muslims led the world in intellectual pursuits.
His goal is to help spark the Arab world's own age of reason, though he acknowledges that there is a long way to go.
"We can defeat the forces of hate and confrontation and build through education, science and culture better understanding for our future," he said at the opening ceremony of a recent conference at the library.
Mr. Serageldin has fashioned himself as the anti-Islamist, a self-declared "secularist when it comes to the civil state," a calling that does not endear him to the conservative majority of this society. But he is comfortable in his role as the founding director of the library, the modern successor to the ancient library of Alexandria.
He uses his position to counter what he has called the "current drift toward an intolerant, pseudoreligious fanaticism." He defends and promotes women's rights, saying "no issue looms larger," and calls for freedom of expression as "the foundation of self-fulfillment." He opposes the Muslim Brotherhood, the popular Islamic movement, and has resisted pressure to allow the creation of a mosque or prayer room within the library itself.
And one of his core messages, aimed at his own community, is that Muslim societies today need to learn from Muslim leaders of the past, like Ibn al-Nafis, the 13th-century religious scholar, philosopher and scientist who called for tolerance in hearing out opposing views.
"How different these enlightened voices from the past sound compared to the frenetic ranting and condemnations of everything that is new and different that we see and hear everywhere in the Arab and Muslim worlds today," he wrote in one of a series of pamphlets issued by the library.
His critics in Egypt's Islamist circles note ruefully that Mr. Serageldin, for all his professed devotion to tolerance and freedom of thought, rarely, if ever, invites them to his conferences. "You find representatives from the left and the nationalists, and of course many of those who are loyal to the current regime," said Muhammad Morsy, the former head of the Muslim Brotherhood bloc in Parliament. "I am never invited, not me or anyone like me."
Mr. Serageldin, 66, grew up in Cairo and graduated in 1964 with a bachelor of science degree from Cairo University. He earned a doctorate in planning from Harvard in 1972 and joined the World Bank that year, passing the next several decades there. He has received 26 honorary doctorates from universities around the world; he is a knight of France's Legion of Honor and a member of Egypt's upper house of Parliament.
But Mr. Serageldin was lured back to Egypt from Washington by the opportunity to help build the new library.
"The ancient library was about openness of knowledge, no taboos, questioning everything, " Mr. Serageldin said as he strolled, hands in pockets, through the soaring 2,000-seat reading room in the library's main hall. "Now, I would hope very much that our own society would benefit a lot from that."
HE knows well that his views are among a distinct minority here in Egypt and around the region, and that his call for freedom of expression runs up against authoritarian systems that stifle public discourse.
He has also been called arrogant and condescending, and accused of exceeding the bounds of his actual expertise. During the closing ceremony of a recent conference, he publicly apologized to Rashad Hussain, President Obama's special envoy to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, saying, "I spoke to him in a tone that appeared to him to be dismissive, and I apologize for that."
But he also says that being unpopular in the more neutral sense is O.K. because throughout history great change was often instigated by the few, and then embraced by the many.
"We who believe in democracy and in liberty are going to win," he said in a speech in 2007. "The statists and the Islamists are standing against the irrevocable march of history."
For the sliver of liberal intellectuals in Egypt who bemoan their nation's inexorable slide from a cultural and intellectual capital, Mr. Serageldin's library is a rare bright spot. He has hired and trained a staff of about 2,200 and keeps the doors open seven days a week until 7 p.m. He said he received about 70 percent of the library's $20 million annual budget from the government, raising the rest in donations, and has accumulated a $23 million endowment.
He has also helped define the library as a learning complex, with a planetarium, art exhibitions, a children's learning center, a virtual reality chamber and a museum chronicling the life of President Anwar el-Sadat. The library also operates as a cultural pulpit for Mr. Serageldin and like-minded scholars and regional leaders.
"Dr. Serageldin debunks the myth about Islam with the insightfulness of a social psychologist and firmness of a school principal," said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California and a Jefferson science fellow with the State Department who attended a recent conference at the library on "Initiatives in Education, Science and Culture Towards Enhanced U.S.-Muslim Countries Collaborations."
In signature fashion, the conference was a forum for opposing views, at times exposing tensions between American and Arab participants. But in explaining the value of debating ideas, rather than stifling discussion, Mr. Serageldin addressed his fellow Muslims.
"Do you think that in the last 1,400 years, there were not books attacking Islam everywhere, there were colonial powers everywhere, and despite that Islam has spread throughout the world," he said. "So let us not be afraid of opinions and ideas; we can fight ideas with ideas."
And to the West, he asked that Muslims not be treated as outsiders.
"The Muslims are here; they are in your own countries; they are your own citizens; they are the children of immigrants. You have to recognize the fact that Islam is part of the West today. It is no longer a force that is outside of it," he said.
WHEN the morning session was completed, Mr. Serageldin gave visiting officials a tour of the library, obviously delighting in both what it is and what he hopes it will become. If there is one thing that Mr. Serageldin is not, it is modest. As he walked through the halls, past the art exhibits, sculptures, supercomputers and computer archives, the hundreds of computer terminals at desks, one visitor asked, "Is this all your doing?"
To which he replied, with a nod, "Yes."
Around the corner, Ahmed Mazhar, an accountant, was touring the library with his wife and three children when he spotted Mr. Serageldin, whom he recognized from his television appearances.
"It is good that he is open-minded like this," Mr. Mazhar said. "At this particular point, Egypt needs people like him, people who are well educated and who entice everyone else to be the same."

Full text: A federal grand jury indicted a Los Angeles toy company and three of its executives for allegedly laundering millions of dollars for Mexican and Colombian drug cartels in a scheme that "cleaned" money when the firm exported Teddy bears and Topo Gigio dolls to foreign countries, authorities said Friday.
The two co-owners of Angel Toy Co., Meichun Cheng Huang, 57, of Irvine and Ling Yu, 52, of Arcadia, and the company's accountant, Xiaoxin "Judy" Ju, 48, of San Gabriel, were arrested without incident Friday morning at the toy firm in the 900 block of South Alameda Street.
Federal authorities alleged that over a four-year period, the company laundered $8.6 million in drug proceeds.
The indictment culminates a two-year investigation by agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security and the California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement.

Full text: Everyone knowledgeable about the criminal case against Zhai Tiantian seems to agree on one point: During a telephone call on April 15 to the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., Mr. Zhai completely lost his cool.
What he intended to say during the call is a matter of dispute. All the same, Mr. Zhai, a former Ph.D. candidate at Stevens and a Chinese citizen, has spent the 11 weeks since then in the Hudson County Correctional Center in Kearny, N.J., on charges of making "terroristic threats," and faces possible deportation.
The case has bloomed into a minor international incident, tracked closely by the news media in China, where it has prompted outrage in some quarters. Chinese diplomats in New York have appealed to the university to help Mr. Zhai.
School officials contend that Mr. Zhai, 26, angered over his suspension from the university for disciplinary reasons, called the switchboard at the campus's main offices and said, "I'm going to burn that building down."
Mr. Zhai's advocates say that while he used inflammatory language, he was speaking metaphorically, to describe the effect of a lawsuit he planned to file against the university challenging his suspension.
Jerry Sova, a friend who has stayed in touch with Mr. Zhai by phone and letter and visited him in jail, said the former student had admitted using provocative words but insisted he never had any intention of committing arson.
"He told me that he said, 'I'm going to burn down Stevens by suing them and going to ABC and CBS,' " Mr. Sova said. "He is somewhat impulsive."
Mr. Sova added, "I think that was a horrible use of language."
To make matters worse for everyone involved in the case, Stevens officials say, the charge against Mr. Zhai has been misinterpreted, particularly in the Chinese news media, as accusing him of acts of terrorism.
The university's special counsel, Chris Adams, explained that New Jersey law uses the term "terroristic threats" to describe "statements made with the purpose to cause serious public inconvenience."
"Unfortunately, it shares the same word as 'acts of terrorism,' " Mr. Adams said "No one is suggesting that this is terrorism."
If convicted, Mr. Zhai faces a penalty of as much as three to five years in prison, Mr. Adams said.
Mr. Zhai, who is from Xi'an, a city in central China, enrolled at Stevens in 2000, said one of his lawyers, Ming Hai. After receiving an undergraduate degree and two master's degrees, Mr. Zhai began pursuing a doctorate in engineering.
His disciplinary case at Stevens began in the spring. University officials, citing confidentiality rules, would not reveal the exact nature of the trouble, but Mr. Zhai's lawyer and friends say it began when a relationship with a woman turned sour.
In early March, the woman, a graduate school instructor at a university in New York City, filed a harassment complaint with the police, Mr. Hai said.
A friend of the woman, a professor at Stevens, also became involved in the romantic dispute, complicating Mr. Zhai's life at the school and perhaps leading to the university's action against him, Mr. Hai said.
On March 11, Mr. Zhai received a letter from an assistant vice president at Stevens saying he had been suspended indefinitely. The letter, while offering no details, stated that Mr. Zhai had violated several provisions in the Stevens Student Code of Conduct involving harassment, intimidation and "conduct that threatens or endangers the physical or mental health or safety of any person."
"The overall conclusion is that your presence on campus is a health and safety risk to members of the Stevens community," the letter said.
On April 15, Mr. Zhai called the main administration building at Stevens, officials said. A campus police officer answered, and Mr. Zhai told the officer what was on his mind.
That evening, the campus police, accompanied by federal immigration agents, appeared at Mr. Zhai's door and took him into custody.
Mr. Adams said Stevens, as required by law, had earlier notified immigration officials that it intended to expel Mr. Zhai -- a move that would effectively cancel his student visa.
Mr. Zhai's case was supposed to be presented to a grand jury, but it is unclear whether that process has begun, Mr. Adams said. Mr. Hai said the authorities would allow the criminal process to run its course before starting deportation proceedings.
For weeks Mr. Zhai was unable to post bail because of a New Jersey requirement that he turn over his passport, Mr. Hai said; immigration officials had taken the passport when he was arrested. The state lifted the requirement, and a friend of Mr. Zhai's posted bail this week. But Mr. Hai said that his client had not been released, and that federal authorities were expected to transfer him to an immigration detention center.
News of the case has been reported across China, and at least one newspaper, the English-language edition of The Global Times, which is backed by the Communist Party, has found geopolitical resonance in the matter.
"The incident lays bare the deep-seated disrespect for Chinese people by the U.S. government, which has long boasted its respect for freedom and human rights," a May 27 editorial said.
It added, "Had the incident taken place in China, some U.S. media outlets would have used it to cast blame on China's human rights record."
Officials from the Chinese Consulate in New York have visited Mr. Zhai in jail three times, Mr. Hai said. And according to Mr. Adams, the consulate has asked the university to "do whatever it can to aid this particular student in his immigration and criminal issues."
Wang Bangfu, a consul there in the Department of Overseas Chinese Affairs, said: "We have been trying our best to ensure that Mr. Zhai's legitimate rights in jail and during the judicial procedure are protected. We hope people working on this case can find a proper solution in accordance with the laws as soon as possible."

Full text: On our national birthday, and amid an angry debate about immigration, Americans should reflect on the lessons of our shared immigrant past. We must recall that the challenges facing our nation today were felt as far back as the Founders' time. Immigrant assimilation has always been slow and contentious, with progress measured not in years but in decades. Yet there are steps communities and government should take to form a more cohesive, successful union.
Consider what one leader wrote in 1753: "Few of their children in the country learn English. The signs in our streets have inscriptions in both languages. . . . Unless the stream of their importation could be turned . . . they will soon so outnumber us that we will not preserve our language, and even our government will become precarious." Thus Ben Franklin referred to German Americans, still the largest ethnic group in America. A century later, Midwestern cities such as Cincinnati and St. Louis were mostly German-speaking. So worried were their native-born neighbors that Iowa outlawed speaking German in public and even in private conversation.
Proponents and opponents of immigration agree on one thing: Learning English is crucial to success and assimilation. Yet learning a language as an adult is hard, so first-generation immigrants often use their native tongue. Historically, English has dominated by the second or third generation in all immigrant groups. Most recent immigrants recognize that they need to learn English, and about 90 percent of the second generation speak English, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Research by sociologists Claude Fischer and Michael Hout published in 2008 suggests that English acquisition among immigrants today is faster than in previous waves.
Residential integration of immigrants is even more gradual. Half a century ago, sociologist Stanley Lieberson showed that most immigrants lived in segregated enclaves, "Little Italy" or "Chinatown," for several generations. This segregation reflected discrimination by natives and the natural desire of "strangers in a strange land" to live among familiar faces with familiar customs. Only with suburbanization, encouraged by government policy in the 1950s and 1960s, did the children and grandchildren of the immigrants of the 1890s and 1900s exit those enclaves. That many of today's immigrants live in ethnic enclaves is thus entirely normal and reflects no ominous aim to separate themselves from the wider American community.
Immigrant intermarriage, then and now, also demonstrates steady progress over generations. In the 1960s, more than half a century after Italian immigration peaked, about 40 percent of second-generation Italians married non-Italians. This pattern characterizes today's immigrants: 39 percent of U.S.-born Latinos marry non-Latinos, according to the Pew Research Center. Intermarriage among second-generation Asian Americans is even more common. Today's immigrants are, on average, assimilating socially even more rapidly than earlier waves.
One important difference, however, that separates immigration then and now: We native-born Americans are doing less than our great-grandparents did to welcome immigrants.
A century ago, religious, civic and business groups and government provided classes in English and citizenship. Historian Thomas P. Vadasz found that in Bethlehem, Pa., a thriving town of about 20,000, roughly two-thirds of whom were immigrants, the biggest employer, Bethlehem Steel, and the local YMCA offered free English instruction to thousands of immigrants in the early 20th century, even paying them to take classes. Today, immigrants face long waiting lists for English classes, even ones they pay for.
Why is this important? A legal immigration system is the not-so-secret edge in a competitive, interconnected world economy. Immigrants enhance our ability to grow and prosper in the dynamic global marketplace. We will need every possible advantage to expand our economy amid its fiscal challenges. Moreover, the aging of our population places a premium on young, productive workers, many of whom must come from immigration.
To improve their integration into our American community, we should:
Provide low-cost English classes, in cooperation with local civic and religious groups, where immigrants build personal ties with co-ethnics and native-born Americans. These connections foster assimilation and help newcomers navigate our complex institutions.
Invest in public education, including civics education and higher education. During the first half of the 20th century, schools were critical to preparing children of immigrants for success and fostering a shared national identity.
Assist communities experiencing rapid increases in immigration, which is traumatic for those arriving here and for receiving communities. Schools and hospitals bear disproportionate costs of immigration, while the economic and fiscal benefits from immigration accrue nationally.
Assimilation does not mean immigrants shed ethnic identities. Our national experience with hyphenated identities shows that good Americans can retain a strong sense of ethnic identity.
We've lived our national motto, "E Pluribus Unum" ("Out of Many, One"), better than any other country. But we ought not to airbrush our ancestors' difficulties in assimilation, nor fail to match our forebears' efforts to help integrate immigrants. Government, churches, libraries, civic organizations and businesses must cooperate to address this challenge, as they did a century ago.

Abstract: In 2007, "Persepolis," the French animated film based on Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel about her Iranian childhood, was released to deserved acclaim. Since June 12, 2009, and the protests that followed the likely rigged re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iranian visibility has risen dramatically. [...] the revolution got a face that launched thousands of clicks in Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year-old student whose fatal shooting at the protests circulated worldwide via the Internet.

Full text: If pop culture is a measure of cultural visibility, then Iranian-Americans have been invisible for decades. Of course, there was Iran itself, hardly invisible. But as a teenager, I knew my reality, one far from hostage crises and contra trials, was never going to make it pop culturally; in fact, I would have bet my little hyphenated life against the very moment of pop cultural breakthrough we're finally reaching now.
Back then, every time a bit of Iran broke through, it was an event. In 1991, when I was 13, "Not Without My Daughter" came out -- the true story of American Betty Mahmoody (played by Sally Field), who was essentially kidnapped by her abusive Iranian husband while on a visit to Iran. I still remember my family's naive moment of rejoicing at the trailer -- Gidget had married an Iranian! But after 45 seconds the voice-over's tune changed: "He swore they would be safe. They would be happy. They would be free to leave. He lied." Apparently Gidget's "crime of being an American" was being met with the horrific punishment of living in Iran forever! On the screen were suddenly bombs, women in veils screaming. It was a horror movie about Iran. We were Freddy Krueger. I went to school the next day filled with shame, as if everyone would be thinking I was a Gidget killer.
The next time I caught mention of Iran in any cinematic sense was four years later, when "Clueless" came out, about a spoiled 90210 Valley Girl, Cher. I still remember doing a mental happy dance when Cher, pointing to a cloud of Cartier, Armani and Aqua Net, declared, "And that's the Persian mafia. You can't hang with them unless you have a BMW." Well, take that, Gidget! Iran had gone from the land of bombs and veils to Iranian-America, a haven of big hair, bling, allah-who-alla-wha-ing, material girls and boys.
In the mid- to late '90s -- the closest Iran-U.S. relations came to a golden age since the '70s -- there were few other popular movie references, but the big-city indie set was hot on Iranian cinema: Abbas Kiarostami, Majid Majidi, Jafar Panahi and Mohsen Makhmalbaf. Much of the novelty of the '90s Iranian art house -- quick to become a Cannes critics' darling -- was a cinema of restriction, what happens when a government won't allow its greatest minds to visit, say, the simplest expressions of female sexuality. My father made the movies mandatory viewing, and I'd often fall asleep in the theater, immune to anything that didn't involve MTV editing or Terminators. Plus, none of the kids at school knew about these bleak yet beautiful knockouts. The tree was falling in the woods, but only Iranians -- and the film critics who love them -- heard the sound.
You can't ignore a diaspora for long, though. The "temporary" immigrant population, a notion primarily perpetuated by Iranians loath to abandon "exile" status, was becoming less temporary. Iranians, left outside of the 9/11 conversation, began to leak fairly seamlessly into the best and worst of pop culture. In 2003, veteran Iranian actress Shohreh Aghdashloo starred in "The House of Sand and Fog," for which she became the first Iranian nominated for an Academy Award (although two years later she played a member of a terrorist family on the hit TV show "24"). In 2005, the best picture winner, "Crash," featured Persian characters and Persian dialogue. Two years later, MTV's "The Real World: Sydney" included a whiny Iranian-American cast member, and even "90210" cast an Iranian.
Worst moment yet: 2006 film "300" outraged Iranians for its depiction of demonic Persian warriors. Best moment yet: In 2007, "Persepolis," the French animated film based on Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel about her Iranian childhood, was released to deserved acclaim.
Since June 12, 2009, and the protests that followed the likely rigged re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iranian visibility has risen dramatically. And of course, the revolution got a face that launched thousands of clicks in Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year-old student whose fatal shooting at the protests circulated worldwide via the Internet. The world was seeing, was listening, for once.
So maybe it's no surprise that pop culture has thrown Iranian-Americans some big bones recently: Last fall, NBC added relatively unknown comic Nasim Pedrad to the "SNL" cast. ABC announced a pilot for Iranian-American humorist Firoozeh Dumas' "Big Fat Greek Wedding" of Iranian-American memoirs, "Funny in Farsi" with Iranian-American funnyman Maz Jobrani as the lead (though ABC did not pick it up). The $200 million movie "Prince of Persia" was released in May. And this spring, the creators of "Jersey Shore" sent out a casting call for a show they are tentatively calling "The Persian Version."
Now that we're starting to be seen as a permanent part of this country's fabric, we have to ask: Is this the manifestation of that hyphen that we long sought? Does it all amount to a Persian Snooki?
Perhaps Kiarostami's acclaimed Cannes entry last month is the best indicator of how to proceed. "Certified Copy" is the director's first totally non-Iranian film -- Frenchwoman (Juliette Binoche) and Brit (William Shimell) star in a movie set in Italy -- catapulting him from a nativist artist to an international director. It's an occasion for Iranians abroad to celebrate. When we can bust out of the ol' pigeonhole -- as when Pedrad gets to play Kathy Griffin or Mary-Kate Olsen instead of Ahmadinejad's wife on "SNL" -- then we will be a real American minority.
Just as most self-respecting Italian-Americans don't want anything to do with the image of Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, we should be the first to dismiss the Persian Snooki princess when she arrives.
After all, a certain type of invisibility, if considered like that superhero power that kids covet, is a virtue. It's up to us to be individuals, to resist what comes after easily fitting into a census category. Being able to say there is no us sounds like freedom to me.

Full text: Luna Park, a large co-op in Coney Island in need of urgent building repairs, had been threatening to drop out of a state housing program for middle-income residents and to convert to market-rate apartments.
Instead, the board of Luna Park, a development with 1,576 units in five megalithic towers, closed on a $47 million bank loan on Monday.
It was the last piece of an aid package that also includes commitments for $21 million in government grants and loans for the complex that will eventually be forgiven.
As part of the funding package -- worked out after months of negotiations involving city, state and federal officials -- Luna Park agreed to remain in the state's Mitchell-Lama program for at least another 20 years, with incentives to remain an additional 10 years.
The $21 million in public grants and loans is one of the largest direct subsidies to be provided to a Mitchell-Lama project, city officials said.
But it was never really clear that Luna Park was in a position to withdraw from the program. Although the co-op's board prepared a plan for withdrawal, a lawyer familiar with the complex said that Luna Park faced legal roadblocks that could have prevented the change until at least 2017.
About a decade ago, engineers discovered that the facades of the buildings, built in the early 1960s, were failing. Since then, the complex -- which is home to 5,000 people, mostly immigrants from Russia -- have been struggling to find a way to fund repairs.
The funding package will be used to strip off all the bricks from the buildings and replace them.
New windows and roofs will also be installed. The co-op board said that because of the large grants, the repair work won't require any increase in co-op charges.
"They used their moxie, their chutzpa, their belief in the American way," said Adam Leitman Bailey, the Luna Park board's attorney, "as well as political skills honed back in Russia."
The unusual funding deal shows both the importance the Bloomberg administration has placed on preserving affordable housing, and how effective a concerted lobbying effort by a large swarm of constituents can sometimes be.
Eric Bederman, a spokesman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said that deal was a good one for the city, which has been working to maintain and expand the supply of housing for people on limited incomes. He said that 30% of the families at Luna Park had very low incomes of less than $23,000 for a family of four.
While Luna Park struggled to develop a plan to fix the problem, alarms were being sounded across the city over the efforts of other Mitchell-Lama developments to leave the program to take advantage of then-rising property values.
City officials say that so far New York has lost 18,000 affordable apartments in 60 Mitchell-Lama developments, and they were working to stem further losses.
A few years ago, the private owners of Brooklyn's Starrett City, the largest federally subsidized development in the country, tried to sell it for $1.3 billion, a move that was eventually blocked by federal housing officials.
Instead city, state and federal officials developed a plan to keep Starrett City in the middle-income housing programs. The government provided a $513 million refinancing, which allowed Starrett City's owners to take $200 million in profit out of the project.
At Luna Park, board members and their lawyers began having weekly meetings with elected officials and discussed their plans to withdraw from the Mitchell-Lama program.
Eventually, the elected officials began searching for funding sources to help.
The city agreed to convert a debt of about $5 million into a forgivable loan, and provided $9 million in direct aid, including $1 million provided through the intervention of the local City Council member, Domenic M. Recchia Jr.
State Sen. Diane J. Savino agreed to find state funds for $1 million. U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler found federal funds to provide $2 million, and Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz provided $2 million in city funding commitments. The total in direct aid: $21 million.
In the meantime, Luna Park is still seeking additional help from elected officials, and even from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Anna Treybich, vice president of the co-op, said the board was seeking $1 million through a local assemblyman for a new security system. In addition the board has filed a complaint about subway-car noise from elevated tracks renovated two years ago that curve around Luna Park.
"We want them to pay for double-paned windows," she said.
Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the transit authority, noted, however, that the subways had been there since 1918, long before Luna Park.

Full text: President Obama hailed yesterday's jobs report for June as more evidence that "we're headed in the right direction," and with any more such good news the U.S. economy will soon be where Japan was in its lost growth decade of the 1990s. If we're lucky.
The reality is that this is another disappointing jobs report at a time in the recovery when new hiring ought to be picking up. Economic growth turned positive about a year ago, and normal recoveries become self-sustaining: Job creation follows the pickup in growth, which means rising income, which leads to more consumer spending, which leads to more business confidence and investment, and even more job creation.
This jobs recovery seems stuck in the Washington mud. The decline in the headline unemployment rate to 9.5% from 9.7% is welcome news, as is the continued gain in manufacturing (9,000 jobs, and 136,000 since last December). However, the labor force shrank again by some 652,000 following a 322,000 decline in May. The average hours worked per week fell to 34.1 from 34.2, when employers should be adding to worker shifts given the big gains in productivity.
After some healthy gains earlier this year, private hiring has been barely positive in the last two months, up 33,000 in May and 83,000 in June. (Census hiring of temporary workers fell by a net 225,000.) A useful rule of thumb is that roughly 150,000 new jobs are needed each month to keep up with normal growth in the labor market to accommodate young entrants and immigrants. To get the jobless rate down even to 8% will require 250,000 new jobs a month for the next three years.
Private employers appear to be in a holding pattern, waiting on hiring decisions until they see how much more the political class will raise their costs. A pair of recent reports by the Business Roundtable and the Manufacturers Alliance have warned about the destructive impact that higher taxes, trade restrictions and more regulation, among other policies, are having on job creation and new investment.
Meanwhile, Washington continues to believe its own advertising that government spending creates growth. Speaker Nancy Pelosi asserted this week that another extension of jobless benefits will cause more people to work, and Mr. Obama responded to a question in Wisconsin about job creation by saying that he wants to create a new tax break for Americans to weatherize their homes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Their worst critics couldn't make this up.

LOS ANGELES -- Federal officials announced a drug-money laundering case here Friday with an unusual twist: the laundering was allegedly done through the sale of Teddy bears and other toys.
An indictment was unsealed in federal court here charging a local company, Angel Toy Corp. and four individuals with conspiracy to launder money and other criminal-law violations. The indictment charges, among other things, that the defendants illegally structured cash deposits to Angel Toy accounts in ways to avoid federal reporting requirements, which call for notification for cash deposits over $10,000. The indictment said the money was derived from "the unlawful distribution of controlled substances." Cash deposits were made on behalf of "Colombian and Mexican clients," the indictment said. Besides possible prison sentences for the defendants, the government is seeking forfeiture of over $8.5 million.
In a press release, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which worked on the case with the U.S. Attorney's office here, said the cash was wired to China and then shipped to Colombia and sold. The Colombian pesos generated by those sales were used to reimburse the drug traffickers with "clean" local currency, ICE said. The agency referred to the scheme as a "black market peso exchange."
"It's no small irony that a multi-million dollar company which promoted itself as a retailer of cuddly stuffed animals was allegedly acting as a financial linchpin for drug trafficking operatives in Colombia and Mexico," said ICE director John Morton, in the agency's statement. "It may be a toy company, but we believe these defendants' pursuits were anything but child's play."
Authorities said that three of the individuals were associated with Angel Toy, including two of the company's co-owners, Ling Yu and Meichun Cheng Huang. The fourth individual defendant was identified as a Colombian businessman. The indictment also charged Ms. Huang with trying to prevent a person from providing information to authorities.
A woman answering the phone at Angel Toy said company officials weren't available for comment. Individual defendants couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
On its website, Angel Toy describes itself as "a manufacturer and distributor of fine quality plush toys and merchandise." The company added that it has "clients all over the world, including North America, South America and Europe."

Full text: How can the most popular sport in the world be so insignificant and secondary in the United States?
It is a bizarre phenomenon that, due to personal reasons, has particularly disconcerted me over the years, as my addiction to soccer is inextricably linked to U.S. history. Indeed, I became entranced by the game thanks to Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his anti-communist witch hunt. Had he not persecuted my left-wing dad, an Argentine functionary at the United Nations, and forced our family to flee New York for Chile in 1954, I would probably still prefer today the sports I practiced during my 10 childhood years as a Yank: baseball, basketball, American football. Instead, I was given the chance to fall in love with the Spanish language, with the Chilean revolution, with one woman in particular and, of course, with el futbol.
As I awkwardly tried, at the age of 12, to compete on the fields of Santiago with classmates who had been playing since they were babes, I can remember resenting the utter absence of the game at my schools in New York. That will change, I told myself, that must change someday. Americans, with their prowess in so many other athletic endeavors, cannot forever turn their backs on something so precise and unpredictable, such a gloriously fierce ballet of bodies.
So it was encouraging to find a less dismal situation when, the victim of a new exile -- this time from Chile -- I settled back in the States in the 1980s. Professional soccer, enhanced by Pele's participation in New York's Cosmos club in 1977, had raised the sport's profile, while millions of youngsters across the land, both male and female, were now playing the game. For two seasons I even coached the junior soccer team of my youngest son, Joaquin -- in Durham, N.C., of all places! And then the U.S. women won the World Championship in 1991, and in 1994 the men's World Cup was held in nine fervent U.S. cities. By 2002 the Yankee team had advanced to the quarter finals and hopes kept rising that soon soccer would be as ubiquitous here as it was globally. That illusion -- bolstered in the current World Cup by Landon Donovan's last-minute "miracle" goal against Algeria -- quickly dissipated. After losing to Ghana in overtime in the next match, the Americans headed home, leaving in their wake the same desolate question about the irrelevance of soccer in the United States that haunted me over half a century ago.
Many reasons have conspired, I believe, to create this bleak state of affairs. Americans have perennially seen themselves as pioneers, constantly reinventing themselves. Their most popular sports have appropriated traditional games and drastically modified the rules: Cricket became baseball, rugby turned into American football, and even basketball can be considered a variation on indigenous native American activities. But how do you take the "foreign" game of soccer and make it into something other than, well, soccer?
The predominance and head start of those more "American" games have not allowed soccer the space to develop at the collegiate and professional level and, perhaps most crucially, soccer is not massively dreamed of as a path to grandeur by athletically endowed children mired in poverty. American kids have the same talent as youngsters in the favelas of Rio or the shantytowns of Nigeria, but it is siphoned off at an early age in search of more lucrative venues.
Nor do children in the United States get to watch much soccer on television. This last point may be an insoluble problem for the sport's advancement because it concerns the structure of the game itself. Major U.S. sports events have timeouts and interludes during which ads can be breathlessly crammed in, but one of the essential attractions of soccer is the dramatic relentlessness of the contest once it has begun. You literally cannot stop the clock. This is such a sacred rule of the game that its organizers have resisted the clamor to allow video replays, even when the referee has made a flagrantly erroneous call that can cost a team victory.
Do all these circumstances mean that soccer in the U.S. is doomed to a minor status forever? There are several reasons for tentative optimism. The first is that the United States, despite the increasing stridency of its anti-immigrant nativists, continues to import millions of citizens from the rest of the world. These men and women and children smuggle their love for soccer across the border along with their frequently illegal bodies.
The second reason is that we are living a moment in history when the very notion of American exceptionalism is under siege. If the United States were indeed to abandon the idea that it has been chosen by God to save the world, if its citizens were to really entertain the notion that they are just the same as humans all over the globe and not uniquely endowed with shining virtue, could they not someday join the rest of the species in celebrating the most beautiful sport of our time? Would it then be inconceivable that a few decades from now the U.S. could win the World Cup?

Full text: Mohammed Al-Rawi's passion for computers carried him through the war in Iraq all the way to the shores of California. His fluency in Windows and in English landed him a job with journalists, put him in the path of multiple bomb and rocket attacks, and brought him here, along with his wife and two young children, for their first Fourth of July in the United States. Like so many new Iraqi immigrants, he has much to celebrate this Independence Day, and much to mourn.
At 21, Al-Rawi ran an Internet cafe in the basement of Baghdad's Flowersland Hotel. He knew how to breach Saddam Hussein's firewalls to access forbidden websites, and in the weeks leading up to the U.S. invasion he helped reporters send their material out of the country. Then government monitors traced a photograph of the president to his computer, and he went into hiding until he saw the first U.S. tanks roll into his southern Baghdad neighborhood and one of the first U.S. soldiers on the ground, an African American in dark glasses with an M-16. "It was just like in the movies," he says.
The Iran-Iraq war had forced Al-Rawi's family to flee their hometown of Basra two decades before. His Shiite mother and Sunni father watched with apprehension in 2003 as war -- and the Americans -- arrived at their doorstep once again. "They'll ruin the country, because they don't know anything," his father warned. But Al-Rawi thought he was wrong.
"I was so happy when they came," Al-Rawi said. "Maybe because almost everyone believes in America and how great the country is. I was so sure they would come and fix everything, that we'd have resources and they'd have a plan."
International businesses and aid organizations poured into the country almost overnight. Translators, computer techs and drivers were in high demand. Al-Rawi went to work first for Associated Press television and then for the Los Angeles Times.
Almost as quickly, an insurgency took shape. It seemed as if anyone with a grievance against the United States came to Iraq to fight the American imperialists alongside militant Iraqis and Al Qaeda.
Al-Rawi's first encounter with them came on Dec. 31, 2003. He took his fiance, Atiaf Matrook, to a restaurant to meet his colleagues and usher in the new year. They realized the table they had reserved was too small for the group that would arrive, so they moved to another just before a suicide bomber rammed his automobile into the restaurant. The two couples who had taken their place at the original booth were killed.
Al-Rawi's next brush with violence came in 2004 as he was installing a satellite dish on the roof of the office. He stepped away a moment before incoming rocket fire destroyed the dish.
Al-Rawi was lucky, and so at first were the rest of the newspaper's Iraqi staff. Sunni and Shia, Arab and Kurd, they worked together keeping computers and generators running, gathering information and educating a revolving door of American reporters in the complexities of Iraq. They kept their jobs secret from all but intimate family members. In the end, it was too much to hope they would be spared the bloodshed that the reporters chronicled day in and day out. First, one of the Sunni translators lost a son in the war, then a Shiite lost his. The staff was consumed with grief.
"In situations like that, you just hang on to the people you trust," Al-Rawi said.
As the war dragged on, Al-Rawi's hopes for a new Iraq faded. His neighborhood became more sectarian; he sent his wife and children out of the country, and when his neighbors expressed suspicions about his job, he started sleeping with an AK-47 nearby. The U.S. began to open its doors to those who felt they were in danger for having worked -- collaborated, some would say -- with the Americans. Like so many others, Times translators started to give up on what one called "the new Iraq that expels and annihilates its own people." One by one, they began to leave.
The final straw for Al-Rawi was in January. Two explosions down the block from the newspaper's offices served as a warning. Al-Rawi helped gather the others into an interior hallway just before the windows and computers where they had been working shattered in the next blast. One translator was cut by glass, but everyone else survived. A month later, visas in hand, Al-Rawi and his family arrived in Los Angeles.
The family settled in Long Beach for the good schools and companionship of a fellow translator. A friend found Al-Rawi an office job. He bought his family a summer pass to Knott's Berry Farm. Tonight, they'll eat barbecue and watch fireworks. He feels fortunate, but he and his wife miss their parents terribly and sometimes find the changes overwhelming. When his new American neighbors ask him whether Iraq is better off since the U.S. war, he hesitates. He recalls his father's admonition about the Americans: "I realized he was right."
Saddam Hussein is gone, but Iraq still is not fully free, and, at 28, Al-Rawi had to leave Iraq to find the peace and promise he sought for his family. That's the bittersweet reality of his first Fourth of July in the United States. "Before the war, I was an Iraqi," he said. "From 2003 to 2004, we were Iraqis working with the American media. In 2005 until the day we left, I was considered an American spy by hardcore Iraqis. Now, I am becoming American."

Full text: I knocked on the door of a basement apartment in a dingy hallway that smelled like old sweat socks.
A gruff voice growled through the closed door. "Who is it?"
"Peter Carlson from the United States Census Bureau."
"I already mailed in my form."
Of course he had. The kind of people who yell at census workers through locked doors always say they already mailed in their form.
"Apparently, we didn't receive it, sir," I said to the door. "Can I do a quick interview with you now?"
"I'm sleeping."
It was 10:30 in the morning. "I'll come back another time. When would be convenient?"
"Never!" he yelled. "Don't come back."
But I did come back. A census enumerator is required to try three times.
"I'm busy," he bellowed through that closed door on the second visit.
"Stop harassing me," he hollered on the third. "Go away."
I went away, thinking, I should come back every day until he opens that damn door. But of course, I didn't. I had other doors to knock on, and besides, I'm not sure I want to be there when he opens his.
I'm a retired newspaperman, and I enlisted as a temporary $18.50-an-hour census worker because I figured it would be interesting. As every reporter knows, it's always entertaining to meet the American people in all their wacky glory.
You learn a lot about your fellow human beings when you take a census -- and not just the answers to the official questions. I spent six weeks working in Montgomery County, and here's what I learned: The American people are quirky, cranky and a little paranoid. They're also a bit confused about race, especially the census's racial categories, but they're surprisingly good humored about it.
Of course, I saw a skewed sample of Americans. Here's why: Every 10 years, the Census Bureau mails questionnaires to every home in the nation. Roughly 70 percent of people promptly fill out the form and mail it back. Those folks are, well, the kind of people who promptly mail back census questionnaires.
The other 30 percent don't mail in the form because they forgot, or they lost it, or their dog ate it, or they didn't understand it, or they hate questionnaires, or they hate the government, or they just don't give a damn, or . . . whatever.
When the government asks Americans to stand up and be counted, these are the folks who remain seated. They're also the folks who got a personal visit from me -- or one of the other 600,000 temporary census workers. The Constitution requires that we count them whether they want to be counted or not.
Knocking on their doors is an adventure. You never know who'll answer. One man opened the door while brushing his teeth and responded to all my questions with a big blob of bubbly toothpaste bobbing up and down on his cheek. One young guy spent the entire interview tapping on his iPhone, updating his Facebook friends about his exciting census experience.
A deaf and blind woman held out her hand and told me to ask my questions by slowly tracing each letter on her palm.
One woman invited me into her house and led me through her living room, which was piled high with papers, to her kitchen, which was also piled with papers. After the interview, she asked if I could help her with a writing project.
And then there was the old guy who protested when I called him "sir." He said he couldn't stand the officers he was forced to call "sir" back in World War II.
See? The American people really are entertaining. Unfortunately, the census form provides no place to capture their delightful quirkiness.
In one Rockville neighborhood, I met immigrants from Suriname, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Bolivia, El Salvador, Peru, Lesotho, Russia, Ukraine, Malawi, Tanzania, Ivory Coast and Sri Lanka -- all living within a mile of one another. I felt patriotic knowing they'd all chosen to live in this country -- the same country my Swedish and Irish grandparents chose 11 censuses ago.
A woman from Panama told me she felt "honored" to be included in the U.S. census. But other people refused that honor. There were lots of them -- the crusty, the nasty, the paranoids muttering about the government or grumbling, "I don't want anybody to know where I live." One woman was willing to tell me that four people lived in her apartment, but she refused to reveal their names. "The names are on licenses, they're in the schools," she said. "Everybody knows who we are."
"I don't know who you are," I pointed out.
"The information is available," she said as she shut the door, "but I'm not giving it out."
One guy who refused to reveal his name suggested an alias. "Just call me Jimmy Jones," he said. "I don't like the government, and I don't like the questions on the form."
I don't like the government either (who does?), but come on, people, the government already knows where you live. That guy who delivers your mail -- who do you think he works for? I find it bizarre that people think nothing of sharing personal information with the salesclerk who sold them a toaster, but they get all antsy when a census-taker asks their name.
When did Americans get this paranoid? The Census Bureau's official online history offers a clue in its account of the 1970 Census: "Researchers also noted a growing distrust of government and resistance to responding to the census."
Well, I guess the '60s could make anybody paranoid. And so could every subsequent decade. Maybe the Census Bureau should start tracking our paranoia, perhaps with a question on the 2020 form:
How paranoid are you?
Not paranoid.
Moderately paranoid.
Why the hell are you asking me that?
Get away from the door or I'll shoot, you jack-booted stormtrooper!
I myself got a tad paranoid during each interview when I reached Question 6 on the form: "What is your race?" Race is a touchy subject in America, and it's not something I usually ask strangers about while standing in their doorways. But it wasn't a problem. In fact, people seemed to have fun with the question.
A lot of white folks smiled and answered, "Just plain old white bread" or "Pure vanilla." And several young black people burst out laughing when they read the last word in the form's description of their race -- "Black, African American or Negro."
When I asked a 90-year old woman the race question, she said, "Oh, I'm a Michigan girl."
One old white guy identified his race as "homo sapien." He said he learned on Wikipedia that it's the only true race and we're all in it together.
I tend to agree, but the census doesn't. The questionnaire lists 12 races, plus a box labeled "Some other race." Several choices seem more like nationalities than races -- Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean -- and this caused some confusion. Some people told me their race was Salvadoran or Iranian.
A Korean immigrant, who kept apologizing for her accent, identified herself and her husband as Korean. When I asked about the race of her children, she said, "Oh, they American."
"American isn't really a race," I said. "Americans come in many races. Should I put down Korean for them, too?"
"No, no," she insisted. "I Korean, they American."
So I checked the box marked "Some other race" and filled in "American." Sounds like that old melting pot is still bubbling.
One guy told me he was white but said his wife insisted on being identified as Armenian.
"What about your kids?" I asked. "What should I put for them?"
He thought for a moment and then got a mischievous grin on his face. "Put down Armenian Irish," he said.
I wrote it down, thinking, Is Armenian Irish really a race?
That seemed weird enough, but a few days later and about a mile away, it got weirder. I interviewed a guy who identified his race as white. His wife's race, he said, was Peruvian.
"And the kids?" I asked.
"They're half and half," he said.
"You want me to put down half and half?"
No, he didn't. He thought out loud for a couple of minutes. White Peruvian? No, that wasn't it. American Peruvian? Not really.
"Put down Irish Peruvian," he said.
So I did. In just six weeks of census work, I felt like I'd witnessed the birth of two new races. Is this a great country or what?
When people get this casual, this playful, this zany about their racial identity, I think we've turned some kind of psychic corner on race in America.
And that's the kind of revelation that could serve to lessen our collective paranoia level. (But, alas, it probably won't.)
I can't wait for the 2020 Census.

Full text: The United States deported 387,790 people in the 2009 fiscal year, but to hear Shyconia Burden of Citizenship and Immigration Services describe it, you would think we're desperate for new recruits. "The goal is to naturalize as many people as want to become U.S. citizens," she told me one recent day in the waiting room of the New York district office where she, an effusively warm community relations officer, has been working since she was 15.
Ms. Burden and her colleagues distribute knapsacks full of informative flashcards and DVDs. They fan out around the city to conduct community workshops. Last year the New York office naturalized around 90,000 people, something like 90 percent of those who applied.
Seated near Ms. Burden as she spoke were people from Canada, the Dominican Republic, Bosnia, Iran, Afghanistan, Columbia, China, Haiti, Nigeria -- whatever assortment the day brought. Having gotten themselves safely to our shores, having beaten the odds and secured a green card, having held that card for at least five years (three for those married to citizens), having filled out Form N-400 and paid $675, they were waiting to undergo an interview.
So was I, although my interview, like the application I had submitted, was only for show.
I was led to a small office, where Officer Tracy Plante began reviewing my file. Was it true that I had lived at the following addresses? Had I ever practiced bigamy? Would I read and write a sentence in English, and take a brief oral exam on the basics of citizenship?
The exam offers 10 chances to get six correct answers. I got there in seven, having choked on the simple question of when income taxes are due.
My error would come as no surprise to the I.R.S. (or my husband). But the truth is, I was nervous. The N-400 is a difficult form to complete, and not just because it asks for such a detailed accounting of your life. It also asks you to commit yourself in ways that I, having been born here, had never before been asked to do.
For example, without bothering to give it much thought, I had always assumed that if I were drafted into military service I could ride it out in some noncombatant role, along with others as idealistic or cowardly as I am. But candidates for citizenship have to state their willingness to bear arms. Then they have to sign an oath to that effect, and then they have to recite the oath.
Some of the questions seemed to be daring me to lie. "Have you ever advocated (either directly or indirectly) the overthrow of any government by force or violence?" Sure, by paying my federal taxes -- or does it not count as overthrow if you call it "regime change"? I went with "no" but worried about the perjury warning at the form's conclusion.
For me, it was an exercise. But a real applicant might be very worried indeed. If an examiner finds any technical problems with the way an immigrant got his green card, or if his background check turns up any unfavorable encounters with law enforcement, that person may wind up not just rejected, but remanded to a detention center. After a hearing, many are deported. Others fall into a limbo from which it may take years to emerge. Since 2003, 112 people died in these detention centers, often from lack of medical attention.
The naturalization process moves more quickly these days than it did before the Department of Homeland Security absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service in 2003. But David Leopold, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said that "removal proceedings" have become a more likely outcome, especially if a candidate has a criminal record. "I've seen almost no favorable discretion," he said, "even if it's a very old conviction and the person has shown through their actions a lifetime of rehabilitation."
I passed my exams and interview. (Good thing I chose the right answer to the question, "Between March 23, 1933, and May 8, 1945, did you work for or associate in any way (either directly or indirectly) with the Nazi government of Germany?") Afterward, I was invited to participate in the next scheduled swearing-in ceremony, held in the auditorium of Baruch College.
It was Flag Day, so everyone got little American flags. Sitting among the 125 elated, exhausted candidates from 40 countries, I thought about all they had gone through to get to this day: leaving home, crossing oceans or borders, living for so long in some anxious half-way status. Maybe it was the video we were watching -- sepia-toned images of the huddled masses yearning to breathe free -- but I got a little teary. Then the music ended, the lights came up, and I looked across the room. The Asian hipster with the Justin Bieber shag had fallen asleep.
When it was time for the national anthem, Ms. Burden busted out with a set of pipes to shame Aretha Franklin. Andrea Quarantillo, the New York district director of the immigration service, told the crowd, "It may be the best work the U.S. government does, to bring new citizens to the country" -- fighting words, in some places. Then we all watched another stirring video, unforgivably accompanied by the Lee Greenwood song "God Bless the U.S.A."
Finally we stood up, row by row, and walked across the stage, for our official papers and a receiving line of congratulatory handshakes. (I received a dummied-up certificate, with a photo someone pulled up off the Internet. Be warned: the Department of Homeland Security apparently reads Gawker.)
The path to American citizenship can be grueling and treacherous, but this day was pure joy. "Really, I feel like I'm free now," said Shaker Baidas, who came here from Jordan in 1994. It was just hard not to think of the millions more who would give anything to join in.

An Algerian detainee at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, deserves a new lower court review to determine whether he was part of al-Qaeda, a federal appeals court has ruled.
A three-judge panel for the D.C. Circuit reversed a lower court decision that Belkacem Bensayah's imprisonment was legal. The lower court had relied on classified evidence from an unnamed source.
"The evidence upon which the district court relied, in concluding Bensayah supported al-Qaeda is insufficient . . . to show he was part of that organization," U.S. Circuit Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in a ruling released Friday.
Ginsburg noted that the government initially called Bensayah a "supporter" of al-Qaeda and later argued that he was "part of" the terrorist organization.
Bensayah was arrested by Bosnian police on immigration charges in late 2001. He was later told that he was a suspect in a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo.

U.S. military authorities have identified the remains of seven servicemen missing in action since their cargo plane went down in Burma during World War II.
The men were aboard a C-47A Skytrain that left India on May 23, 1944, to resupply Allied forces near Myitkyina, Burma. In 2002, a missionary found the crash site, about 31 miles northwest of Myitkyina. A military team excavated.
The men will be buried with full military honors July 15 at Arlington National Cemetery.

Full text: This most patriotic of holidays prompts me to ask a decidedly unpatriotic question: Is America in decline?
I'm not alone in wondering. It'd take a week to read all the books and articles on the subject in recent years.
Many compare our society today to that of the Roman Empire as the barbarians closed in. One book title posed the issue concisely as, "Are We Rome?"
It's an unusual situation for Americans. The nation's history has generally been one of extraordinary expansion and ascent. First we spread across the continent. When World War II ended, we were a superpower. When the Soviet Union collapsed, we became the only superpower.
Three developments explain the worry that we're slipping. One is the rise of China, seen as a realistic contender to replace us at the top. Another is the 2008 financial crisis, which undermined confidence in America's free-market economic model. Third is the perception that the nation is incapable of dealing effectively with obvious major challenges -- the budget deficit, unemployment, oil addiction, illegal immigration, deteriorating infrastructure.
To answer the question, it's necessary to break it into two parts. Are we in decline relative to other countries? And are we in decline in some absolute sense?
When comparing the United States with other countries, the answer depends on the area of competition.
In military strength, for instance, the United States is still unquestionably on top. Our defense spending exceeds the combined total of the next 10 highest-spending countries, and our technology is unmatched.
We're striking our most despised enemy, the al-Qaeda leadership, with drones piloted by operators sitting comfortably far from the scene. Generals fret that "combat" has become so safe for some that it's hard to justify medals honoring the traditional military virtues of valor and personal sacrifice.
Think about that. It's the kind of problem you want to have.
The picture is mixed when it comes to the "soft power" combination of diplomatic clout and all-around international influence.
George W. Bush's presidency cost us goodwill abroad. I was overseas for nearly three years of it and saw the damage caused by his rest-of-the-world-be-damned approach. It also hurt when an American institution, Wall Street, was the main culprit in the worst global business slump in seven decades.
On the upside, President Obama is well liked overseas. American democracy and freedoms still inspire many foreigners. U.S. popular culture, from Hollywood to Facebook, remains dominant.
One field where we've definitely lost ground is the global economy. That's partly because the rest of the world, especially in Asia, is catching up.
Shortly after World War II, the United States accounted for nearly half of total world output. For several decades now, our share has been about a fifth.
In 1950, China made up less than 5 percent of the world economy. Now its share is more than 10 percent and rising.
That's not necessarily bad. China's growth has exploded because it adopted free-market policies that we've been recommending for decades.
America's problem is that the global economy is seriously unbalanced, and we're on the red ink side of the ledger. Globalization, which we championed, led to the export of millions of good-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs. That means we're now running large trade deficits. In our foreign accounts, as in the gaping shortfall in the federal budget, we are living beyond our means.
This can't continue indefinitely, and the fix is eventually going to hurt our standard of living somehow.
Right now, America is sharply divided over painful choices. Should we spend more to fight joblessness? Or should we move now to contain the government deficit?
That uncertainty points to the other half of the broader question: Are we in decline in some absolute way? In particular, is our political culture so gridlocked that we're unable to address long-standing problems that we know need solving?
I'm sad to say the evidence right now suggests that the answer is yes. Consider three domestic issues:
1. The Gulf of Mexico oil spill has reminded everyone of the environmental hazards of our dependence on petroleum. But there's no movement toward a meaningful policy to significantly change our energy habits.
2. Virtually everyone regrets the massive violation of immigration laws represented by the presence of 12 million or so illegal residents. But our leaders can't agree on the only available compromise, which would provide for a mix of gradual amnesty, strict employer sanctions and a guest-worker program.
3. The nation's infrastructure is deteriorating, from roads to subway lines to water mains. But the public doesn't want to pay higher taxes and fees to fix the problem.
How did this happen? At the root of the deadlock is a fundamental disagreement between liberals and conservatives about the size and role of government.
To end it, a grand compromise is desirable. It would take another column to describe such a deal, but here's the basic trade-off. As a condition of raising public funds to address the nation's problems, liberals need to show that they can use tax money wisely and keep government from quashing entrepreneurial energy. Conservatives need to show that they care as much about the common good -- such as preserving a social safety net and protecting the environment -- as they do about private interests.
So, to answer my own unpatriotic question: Yes, America has begun a decline, mainly because we've let the economy and our political culture deteriorate. But we can still reverse it. We're still the wealthiest nation in all of world history. Our politics have shown tremendous resilience and adaptability over more than two centuries. The elections of Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama showed how quickly our system can deliver dramatic change at the top, even if structural problems remain.
We need to summon again the vision and political courage of the Continental Congress whose work we celebrate today. With that, America could resume the ascent that it has enjoyed -- overall, despite a few setbacks -- since 1776.

Abstract: The two-story yellow-brick building had seen better days. [para] Laura Mendelson followed the American soldiers guarding her and the rest of the team of U.S. government employees up the crumbling concrete steps.

Full text: The two-story yellow-brick building had seen better days. [para] Laura Mendelson followed the American soldiers guarding her and the rest of the team of U.S. government employees up the crumbling concrete steps. The dimly lighted lobby was loud with the strident voices of a crowd of women in headscarves and long tunics. They shouted for the team's attention. They wanted something. [para] "Don't stop," said the soldiers. "Keep moving." [para] Mendelson wished she could make out what the women were shouting. Through the rush and commotion, she could tell they were speaking Dari and not Pashto, two of the most common languages in southern Afghanistan, but not much more. Forty-eight hours ago, she'd been in Washington getting ready for this. She's with the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, part of the State Department. She's a trained Arabic speaker. But in the push to deploy, no one on the team had had time for more than a couple of hours of Dari and Pashto instruction. [para] Mendelson and the team entering the building represent what military and civilian experts alike have called "the way out" of Afghanistan: a civilian surge, on par with the military surge, to help the country rebuild itself. More than a year after President Obama called for such action, this is what that way out looks like. [para] Down a quiet hall, the women's voices were a distant echo as Velcro tore apart and body armor came off the civilian team. Mendelson removed her helmet and adjusted her peach-colored head scarf. She'd never had to wear a scarf with a helmet before. She took a seat at one end of a battered table. [para] The far end was crowded with Afghan men: the police chief in his gray uniform; the other provincial officials and a mullah in the traditional outfit of tunic and baggy trousers known as salwar-kameez. They all wore jackets and shawls against the old building's unheated chill. A portrait of Afghan President Hamid Karzai hung on a wall that was flaking paint. [para] The provincial governor began with a long list of problems. The women begging for help in the lobby; a lack of fertilizer; a central government that coughed up only half of the promised budget; a police force with no training, gasoline or radios; a new road so poorly built that only goats and drug smugglers used it; broken promises from Americans who had come before. A young man in a prayer cap shuffled around the table serving tea. The mullah fingered his prayer beads. [para] Despite the overwhelming list of needs, it seemed to Mendelson that the meeting was going well. Her USAID colleague Adam Schumacher had volunteered to take the lead at this first meet-and-greet, and he was saying all the right things. He avoided offering to do for the Afghans what they could do for themselves. He deftly steered them toward resources within their own government. He made no promises he couldn't keep.
He was gathering useful information. Then the governor brought up the accidental bombing of a village a month ago.
"The Americans make mistakes and make problems for the government," he said through the interpreter. "Six innocent people were killed."
Mendelson exchanged glances with the State Department representative beside her. Six deaths? They'd been aware of only one. Compensation had been paid. They'd thought the problem had been handled. Apparently, it hadn't. Mendelson was filled with guilty relief that Schumacher was the one in the hot seat. She was 51, 10 years older than Schumacher, but she was new to USAID. She'd spent 3 years in Afghanistan as a civilian adviser to the Army, but that work had all been done at a safe emotional distance -- reading reports, writing assessments. She'd rarely left the base.
Schumacher, on the other hand, had been a USAID foreign service officer for five years; Afghanistan was his third overseas posting. But it was his first posting in a war zone. This time, to these Afghans, he was the American representative -- the face not just of USAID but also the U.S. military, and that was outside his comfort zone.
Schumacher tried to get clarification on the number of casualties. He tried to connect. He said he understood the pain caused by these deaths because many Americans had died in Afghanistan, as well.
That didn't go over well. At all. The Afghans objected that this was not the same, that the American military dead weren't members of Schumacher's family. One man's face grew red. The governor concluded: "I invite all of you to come to the village. We will invite the media. And you can apologize to the villagers who were bombed."
As the meeting was breaking up, another American standing by the wall stepped forward and said loudly: "Okay, if everyone will just keep their seats, we'll do the hot wash right here. First, let's find out how the Afghans think it went."
Although this rundown building might have felt as if it was in the Third World, it wasn't. Outside the dusty windows lay not the deserts and mountains of Afghanistan, but the rolling green fields of an Indiana National Guard training facility. Half a dozen trainers wearing armbands were watching from the edges of the room. The Afghans at the table were all immigrants with recent experience back home. This was a training exercise, and the role-playing was over. Now it was time for the critique.
A week from now, ready or not, Mendelson, Schumacher and most of the other Americans at the table would be leaving for Afghanistan. That was why, when the bombing issue came up, Schumacher had decided to experiment with a response he wasn't sure would work.
The feedback confirmed that it probably wouldn't. "I knew I was going out on a limb, tying their sorrow with my sorrow," he said later. "But that's what made it valuable. I came here to test limits, to find out what works and what doesn't. If you come to this training with any ego, you're not going to get anything out of it."
Tomorrow, it would be Mendelson's turn in the hot seat.
The civilian surge includes USAID development specialists, State Department diplomats, Justice Department lawyers, Agriculture Department agronomists, and experts from Treasury, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration, among others. The reason Obama called for more of these people is because at that point, eight years into the war, the civilian effort was even more understaffed than the military effort. USAID, for instance, had 85 people in-country, most of them hunkered down inside a walled compound in Kabul.
"That's the first thing about USAID," says Robert Perito, a post-conflict stability expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a research and training institution established by Congress. "There's nobody at USAID." It wasn't always that way.
"USAID was a repository of expertise and knowledge about development...that would result in the improvement of societies around the world and, by the way, serve the interests of the United States," recalls George Moose, a former assistant secretary of state. He's talking about USAID's heyday, the 1960s, when the agency fielded more people in Vietnam alone than the 1,569 it fields today worldwide.
After the Vietnam War, America turned inward. USAID and the State Department watched their budgets and staffs steadily shrink. "In the absence of other resources, there was an increasing readiness to rely on military commands to try to fill the gap," says Moose, who recently testified before Congress on the role of civilian and military agencies.
The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, tested the military's ability to do it all -- fight wars and rebuild the nations it invaded. Provincial reconstruction teams, or PRTs, were set up in key Afghan provinces in 2002. The American teams consisted of military civil affairs soldiers, National Guard members and a few civilians.
The civilian effort had no consistency, according to Perito's surveys of civilians returning from the PRTs. "One person is an expert in tribal structures, and the next person is interested in building roads," Perito says. They came and went without overlapping each other. "No one gave the PRT leadership any overarching goals or strategic guidance. The teams were left to work it out on their own on the ground."
The lack of civilian focus and resources, combined with the inadequate military presence, disillusioned the Afghan population and contributed to the insurgency taking root and eventually threatening the whole country. "When you talk about a baseline, after nine years of war, of less than 100 people in the field doing [development] work for a country of 29 million, you realize some of the forces that led to this," says Anthony Cordesman, a national security scholar with the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) who has advised the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal.
The effort lost even more focus and resources when U.S. attention shifted to Iraq. "[The Iraq experience] reinforced the recognition that the military can't do this on its own," says Stephanie Sanok, a former Iraq policy specialist who served in the Baghdad embassy. "It's the Department of Defense, not the Department of Defense and Much, Much More."
The "more" includes economic development, reconstruction and improving the ability of the Afghan government to meet its people's needs, a process known as "capacity building." Sanok, now with the CSIS, says, "In order to work yourself out of a job and depart a nation in a responsible way, you are going to have to transition programs and projects to local authorities, and you're going to need civilian trainers to build that capacity."
By the time the Obama administration took over running the war in Afghanistan, it was clear that both the military and its civilian partners needed more boots on the ground, and fast. But whereas the Pentagon could call up reservists and the National Guard to supplement its active-duty service members, neglected civilian institutions such as USAID had to build up their workforces from scratch.
Finding civilians with the appropriate skills who were willing to leave home for a year or more of grueling days doing difficult work in a dangerous place, often while living in primitive conditions, has not been easy. Finding those civilians fast has been impossible. The initial goal was to boost the number of American USAID staffers from 85 to 333, but after more than a year, that increase hasn't been achieved. As Mendelson was completing her training in May, she was one of 271, according to Charles North, senior deputy director of USAID's Afghanistan-Pakistan task force. The goal now is 377 by year's end, he says.
At first, in the push to get people in the field, the main qualification for new hires seemed to be a simple willingness to go. Now, USAID targets people with expertise in agriculture, infrastructure, private enterprise, education, health care and good governance.
Hiring the right people, though, has been only half the battle. For years, civilians were shipped off to Afghanistan with, at most, a few days of training. It was as if "you add civilians and water, and get instant development," Cordesman says. Just adding more unprepared civilians to the mix wasn't going to solve that problem. So a year ago, as the surge got underway, State Department leaders made training mandatory.
USAID's new hires now spend a week in the Ronald Reagan Building's basement learning how to operate within the agency's bureaucracy. For two weeks, they commute to the campus of the State Department's Foreign Service Institute in Arlington for a crash course in provincial reconstruction teams; U.S. military and political strategy; and Afghan culture, history, politics, geography and religion. They trek to the West Virginia woods for a "crash-bang" course: how to drive their way out of an ambush, how to fire a weapon. They learn combat lifesaving techniques and countersurveillance -- spotting a tail and shaking it. And they spend a week at the Indiana National Guard's Muscatatuck Urban Training Center.
But with training time at a premium, stabilization and development experts complain that the crash-bang course and countersurveillance instruction is a waste of time for people who will be traveling only in military convoys. In-depth strategic training is still missing. "And they're still not learning how to build capacity in their Afghan counterparts," adds Lauren Van Metre, who specializes in education and training at the U.S. Institute of Peace.
However, none of the experts interviewed for this article disputes the value of the day-to-day tactical skills taught at Muscatatuck. Those skills are critical for USAID especially, because the majority of USAID's people in Afghanistan are now working out in the field, not holed up in Kabul. At Muscatatuck, the civilians train alongside the National Guard on the grounds of what was once a sprawling institution for the mentally handicapped. Among dozens of spooky, abandoned buildings, and a mocked-up marketplace, prison and cemetery, civilians are plunged into a military environment, many of them for the first time.
The grazing cows ignored the convoy of Humvees as it rumbled past. From a back seat, Mendelson caught glimpses of frame farmhouses and silos. She and a trainee from the Treasury Department chatted with the Indiana National Guard soldiers in the driver's seat and the turret. Water dripped from the Humvee's ceiling. Mendelson was nervous. They were on their way to another role-play, a meeting on women's affairs, and it was Mendelson's turn to take the lead.
The turret gunner, Spec. Joshua Diaz, sat on a strap slung below an opening in the roof, his upper body in the turret, his boots on the platform between the back seats. The soldier shouted down to Mendelson over the engine, "What's your specialty?"
"Anticorruption," Mendelson shouted back, laughing, "so this is kind of a stretch." She tended to smile when she talked. It made her sound enthusiastic, even after staying up late with Schumacher, blearily running through all the questions, solutions and pitfalls they could think of. "How do you feel about the training?" she asked. "Does it seem realistic to you?"
"Yeah, it seems pretty real. But what you guys are doing is new to us." Diaz and the driver, Sgt. Kenneth Arnett, were both in their mid-20s. Both had already done tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. But they were not just props for the civilians' training vignettes. They were here to train, too.
The National Guard provides security to all the American provincial reconstruction teams in Afghanistan. It guards the PRT compounds and protects the teams anytime they go outside the wire. Before this combined training began at Muscatatuck, Guard members had had no practice operating with civilians in tow and little sense of why the civilians were there in the first place. So, in addition to sharpening their convoy and security skills, they were learning how to work with civilians. Unlike soldiers, civilians tended to respond to orders with "Why?" instead of a salute, and they had the nerve-racking habit of veering away from their security detail if they spotted someone they needed to talk to.
Beyond the Humvee's small windows, thick, hazy and bulletproof, the Indiana countryside rolled by, tranquil and green. Mendelson adjusted her helmet over her bulky headscarf. Her boyfriend, a British Royal Marine, had worn the scarf in the Persian Gulf War, official military issue. For combat wear, its peachy hue was an odd touch. She called it her superhero cloak. It had gotten her boyfriend safely through. Now, she was counting on it to do the same for her.
Up ahead through the windshield, a field of jumbled, broken concrete loomed. They were coming up on the border between Indiana and Afghanistan. Here at Muscatatuck, the Afghan landscape was represented by crumbling buildings, forsaken construction sites, a mobile home graveyard, wrecked and rusted cars, and piles of concrete.
Mendelson pointed to a car parked out of the way at the rubble's edge. "Wherever we went in Afghanistan, if there was a car sitting over there, we'd be real careful now." What was simply a parked car in Indiana could be a spotter in Afghanistan, calling ahead to insurgents lying in wait that a target was on its way.
The road led into the rubble, piles of it on both sides. Muffled pops erupted, sudden and startling. "Fire!" Mendelson shouted. She strained to spot the source, saw the muzzle of a weapon sticking out from behind a rock. She shouted again, and the Treasury trainee did, too, both of them shouting out the location of the danger the way they'd been trained: "Fire at one o'clock!"
The volume of pops grew louder until it was drowned out by a steady string of bangs from the turret -- Diaz, firing back. His boots shuffled on the platform next to Mendelson as he turned the turret to fire at more pops from the other side of the road. The sharp smell of cordite filled the cab. Mendelson knew all the weapons were firing blanks, but she couldn't help ducking. With a boom, an explosion spouted up next to the road, a thin plume of smoke and dirt. It was a pale imitation of an improvised explosive device, an IED, but still a reminder of the No. 1 cause of death and injury in Afghanistan.
Then the convoy lumbered out of the rubble, and the ambush was over. It had lasted 20 seconds. The Humvees drove on, their pace unchanged.
At the wheel, Arnett made a leisurely turn and said, "Last time in Iraq, I got hit by an IED, and all I heard was my ears ringing."
Asense of adventure is one thing most people who sign up for this work have in common. While studying agriculture at the University of Arizona in the 1970s, Mendelson's adventurousness prompted the native New Yorker to drop out, jump in a pickup and drive across America with a Saint Bernard, headed for Alaska. She worked in a bar, waited for the salmon run in Montana, got tired of waiting and picked apples in Washington state.
She never made it to Alaska. Instead, she milked cows on a kibbutz in Israel, studied Arabic in Egypt and joined archeological digs in Turkey. After waitressing her way through a Georgetown MBA and working summers at the Commerce Department's Mideast-North Africa Desk, she joined the Washington office of Arthur Andersen and served as a business consultant to the Palestinian Authority.
She carries all of the important things in her life in an oversized backpack. When she hoists it onto her back, she looks like a little turtle. She's fond of saying: "Life is like a pinball game. It doesn't just go in one direction."
Mendelson was in Flint, Mich., representing Arthur Andersen at a meeting with city officials, when the planes flew into the twin towers. That day, she decided: "I have to figure out how to help. I have to help my home town. I have to help my country." She joined the New York City Police Department as its first civilian analyst, dispensing advice based on her unique combination of knowledge and experience. When she was offered a contractor job doing the same thing for the Army in Afghanistan, she grabbed it. She told her sisters it was a chance to get closer to the fight.
Three and a half years later, she made the switch to USAID. On a Friday afternoon a few weeks into the training, she hurried to Union Station and took Amtrak to New York to say goodbye.
It was a cold, rainy weekend. Mendelson spent Saturday afternoon at a high school baseball game, huddled under a wool blanket with her older sister Lisa and Lisa's teenage daughter Katie, watching Katie's brother at bat. An American flag was next to the scoreboard. Lisa and the other parents in the concrete bleachers talked about upcoming birthdays, player injuries, the PSAT, golf.
"When did you become such a big golfer?" Mendelson asked Lisa, amused.
"When I couldn't stand watching any more baseball," Lisa said.
Mendelson and Katie wandered around the edge of the baseball diamond to the refreshment stand. They sipped hot chocolate and talked about boyfriends, the kind of trivial talk that made Mendelson angry the first time she came home from Afghanistan three years ago. People there were fighting and dying, and people here were talking about boyfriends and golf. Eventually, though, she decided this was exactly what she was working so hard to protect -- this ordinary, unfearful life.
During Mendelson's time working for the Army, she shared an eight-person plywood hut on Bagram Airfield, just north of Kabul. In a cubicle in a cavernous old hangar, she pored over reports from the field. Back when she was advising distressed cities such as Flint for Arthur Andersen, one of the things she'd focused on was corruption. According to some development experts, Afghanistan is one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
Mendelson had figured that out for herself from the reports she was reading. "The corruption was just obvious from the start," she recalls. The military began taking steps to combat it, but only at the tactical level. She was frustrated by the lack of a broader strategy.
Then last fall, during a week of meetings in and around the embassy in Kabul, she had an epiphany: "Okay, this is where the policy and strategy happen, this is where it makes sense to happen -- the civilian side." While briefing incoming USAID staffers, she thought, I want to be them.
Talking with her sister Lisa, she debated the pros and cons of a job based out of an embassy instead of a large, secure military base, a job that would require her to "get out in the mix" more. Pros: better food; interesting people to work with. Con: more likely to get blown up. The pros won.
Day Three of training at Muscatatuck, and so far, so good. Mendelson's role play meeting with the director of women's affairs had gone so well that one trainer told another it was the best he'd ever seen. When Mendelson and her teammate Adam Schumacher heard that, they did a little jig.
After the meeting, the convoy loaded up and moved out. The road wound into the woods, where a onetime Girl Scout camp had been transformed into a forward operating base. FOBs are generally smaller and closer to population centers than the big airfields. The convoy pulled in through the FOB's guarded gate for lunch.
Inside the rustic wooden dining hall, the education continued. "Body armor," a civil affairs soldier advised two USAID trainees over steak salad and potatoes, "is like putting on a layer of distrust between you and the other person. Taking off the armor says, 'I trust you,' and that creates an obligation." Among older people in southern Afghanistan, he explained, the traditional honor code of Pashtunwali still means something.
Across the rows of rough-hewn tables, a training exercise was underway. Mendelson and half a dozen other trainees watched as a soldier playing the role of the FOB commander tried to convince two trainees playing visiting USAID officers that his district needed more civilian support. Wrapping up his pitch, he leaned forward with an eager salesman's grin. "So, shall we clear some cots off for you and move you in?"
Mendelson and the other trainees burst out laughing.
One of the faux USAID officers said dryly, "We'll get back to you."
After lunch, the convoy rolled on to another role-play, this one involving Afghans. The training program at Muscatatuck wouldn't be possible without them. That's true of USAID's programs in Afghanistan, too. In the past year, in addition to hiring more Americans, USAID has hired more Afghans in Afghanistan. Local staffers speak the language and can usually get around safely in cars or on motorbikes instead of the military convoys required to move Americans around. But not always. While USAID hasn't lost any Americans, 77 non-American staffers and contractors, mostly Afghans, have been killed as of May 31, according to the American Embassy in Kabul.
Among the role-players at Muscatatuck are those who have fled the violence. Some arrived so recently they speak almost no English. For each training session, 20 to 40 Afghans with recent Afghanistan experience are recruited from around the United States by McKellar Corp., the training and policy analysis firm that runs the training. Some once worked for the Afghan government, others for nongovernmental organizations. Some were police officers or soldiers. "Many," writes McKellar curriculum developer Lisa Backstrom in an e-mail, "have experienced life under the Taliban and/or the realities of life in a war-torn and under-developed country."
You can see it in the role-plays.
After acting their way through another meeting, a parade of Afghan officials, elders and American government civilians, flanked by soldiers carrying M-16s and led by a Humvee with a gunner in the turret, set off down the street. They trudged past a burned-out house. Beside it lay a heap of rubble.
The Americans carried boxes hand-labeled in black marker: Water, Blankets, and 12 Man Tents. One person carried a big stuffed cream-colored puppy labeled Sheep. These were "gheramat" gifts, compensation for the victims of the accidental American bombing of this ersatz village. As the man playing the governor had suggested in that first role-play meeting that Schumacher had led, the Americans had come to apologize.
The men playing villagers waited for them on carpets and tarps laid out under a tree. Off to the side two women in burqas huddled like lonely blue ghosts. Mendelson and a 25-year-old State Department trainee named Jacklyn Palme were led to the women by a man who said he was a cousin. Mendelson and Palme took off their helmets and knelt.
One of the women slowly rocked.
"We're so sorry," said Palme, her brows pulling together. "We're deeply sorry for your loss."
"I'm a medic," Mendelson said. That was her assigned role this time. "I would like to offer my services to you, if you have women or children who've been wounded."
From within the slowly rocking burqa came a small voice. The male cousin translated: "Treatment would not bring my son back. Can you bring him back?"
From the group of men behind them, a wail went up. An older man wrapped in a brown shawl wailed again and slapped the carpet. He clambered to his feet and shouted in a hoarse, broken voice. The villagers and officials jumped up and crowded around him. The American men sat very still.
The other woman spoke up firmly from inside her burqa. Once again, the cousin translated: "What kind of help can you offer?"
"We have brought engineers with us today to help rebuild," Mendelson said.
Behind her, the wailing man quieted and sank to the carpet.
Before her, the rocking woman murmured plaintively through the cousin: "I wish you could bring my son back."
"I'm sorry." Mendelson put her hand over her heart. "I can't bring your son back. But maybe I can help save other children in the village from disease or illness."
"You can rebuild my house, but my soul is gone, my heart is burning. I hope you never see such a sorrow as I saw."
Mendelson's eyes reddened. In a situation that wasn't real, she hadn't expected to react like this. Yet a feeling of loss rushed over her. She knew about loss, not violently, not as a mother, but as a daughter. During her time in Afghanistan, she had unexpectedly lost her mother, then her father. "I'm sorry," she said again, quietly. "There is nothing we can do to heal your pain. Only time will heal your pain."
The woman's hands pressed themselves to her burqa-covered face, and she rocked.
At the end of the week, Mendelson and the rest of the civilian trainees boarded a bus and left behind the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center's staged violence and destruction, its recitations of frustration and despair. The road took them through a quiet Midwestern town with wide streets lined with old brick storefronts, fast food chains, plastic signs, a Wal-Mart.
For a moment, looking at the faces around her on the bus, Mendelson suddenly feared for them, even as she joined them in talking about their plans and hopes for the work that lay ahead. The town gave way to peaceful green fields. Farmhouses slipped past, a pickup in the drive, a swing set next to the barn.
On the bus, they cracked jokes. They told stories such as the one the Treasury trainee told on himself: Two Afghan role-players came to him about a clinic that needed repairs; he asked if they had any photographs; they gave him a funny look because "apparently," he mocked himself, "local, poor Afghan villagers don't own digital cameras."
After an hour and a half, the trainees reached the Indianapolis airport. In a few days, they would board planes in Washington. They would make their way east, over the Atlantic, across Europe, to Dubai. And from there, waiting over the horizon, would be Afghanistan, where everything is real.

Abstract: Among them: * Near-stagnant demand for goods and services as a result of consumers' reluctance to return to their free-spending ways. * A disturbing falloff in the creation of new small businesses. * The devastation of the real estate market. * Uncertainty about the economic outlook at home and abroad. "I look at the long-term trend, and it's not a positive one," he said.

Full text: In every recession over the last three decades, it has been America's small businesses -- those Lilliputian companies with fewer than 100 employees -- that stepped forward, began hiring and pulled the country out of the mire.
Not this time.
Small firms are on the sidelines, and it's not just because of tight credit from the financial meltdown, as the Obama administration and others have been saying.
Rather, a host of factors -- some well-recognized and others seemingly unnoticed in the national debate over economic policy -- are converging to restrain small-business owners from hiring.
Among them:
* Near-stagnant demand for goods and services as a result of consumers' reluctance to return to their free-spending ways.
* A disturbing falloff in the creation of new small businesses.
* The devastation of the real estate market.
* Uncertainty about the economic outlook at home and abroad.
"Small businesses are not hiring, and until then, we will not have a strong, sufficient recovery," said Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.), a member of the House Committee on Small Business. "I think this is why the economic recovery is moving very slowly."
It's a historical change of major proportions. In each of the previous three economic recoveries, small employers accounted for the vast majority of new jobs -- the bulk of them coming from firms with fewer than 20 workers, according to Census Bureau data.
Between 1990 and 1993, employers with 1,000 or more workers added 258,000 jobs. Those with 500 to 999 workers shed 102,000 jobs during that period. But the smallest mom-and-pop operations added 860,000 jobs, census figures show.
The contrast was even more dramatic after the deep recession in the early 1980s.
This time, unemployment levels are worse than in previous downturns, seemingly stuck near 10%, with more dismal news coming in Friday's jobless report for June. That and other recent evidence of economic weakness have increased fears of a double-dip recession.
The fact that many small firms are seeing little increase in demand for their services and products is decisive for Scott George, owner of Mid-America Dental & Hearing Center, which employs 55 people in the southwestern Missouri town of Mount Vernon.
"I'm not having any trouble getting money," said George, who recently got a $250,000 loan to renovate a building. But he's not hiring more workers because of little or no growth in sales.
"If I got more people coming through the front door, then I'd need more people to take care of them," George said.
Then there is the problem of fewer small companies starting up.
The rate of business creation fell sharply in the last two years but had been dropping since 2005, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, a research consortium. Separate government data from states such as California and Florida confirm the trend.
An aging population may explain part of the decline. Typically, it's been people under 30 who have launched firms, but that burden has shifted to older entrepreneurs, said Julio De Castro, lead author of the monitor's U.S. report.
"I look at the long-term trend, and it's not a positive one," he said.
And President Obama's pledges to spur small-business activity and hiring -- including boosting government-backed lending and reducing taxes for start-ups -- have been slow to be adopted as lawmakers fret about the federal deficit.
Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank in Chicago, fears the recently passed financial regulatory overhaul could further impede new business formation. "Washington is tightening standards," he said.
In the meantime, the depressed real estate market, which many fear is headed downward again as home sales and construction falter, is exerting indirect but heavy pressure on many small firms.
The connection between real estate values and the health of small businesses has received relatively little attention from most policymakers, but real estate has long been the financial lifeblood of such companies, nurturing profits and expansion.
Nearly all small-business operators own their homes, according to the National Federation of Independent Business, and about half of them own all or part of their companies' buildings or land. What's more, the lobbying group found, 4 in 10 small employers also own investment real estate.
These real estate holdings often have generated profits and provided collateral for companies to borrow against for new machinery or other expansion. That's been especially important in entrepreneurial hubs such as Los Angeles.
Now, just as many consumers can no longer use their homes as cash machines, many small businesses can't draw on their properties to invest and hire. In a 2008 survey, 22% of small employers told the federation that they had taken out at least one mortgage to support their business operations.
"In olden days, many of the start-ups got financing by refinancing their homes. That's gone," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Cal State Channel Islands.
Sohn recalled a small auto dealer in Los Angeles who made most of his money not by selling cars but by frequently refinancing the mortgage on his lot, which until recently kept rising in value.
It's the same story for many immigrant entrepreneurs who bought hole-in-the-wall restaurants soon after arriving in America, he said. "Because of real estate, they bought homes and went out to eat," pumping up sales and jobs at other mom-and-pop businesses, Sohn said.
Even for small firms that are doing well in this economy, the bleak real estate market is an obstacle to increasing sales and adding staff.
Bob McCutcheon is trying to expand McCutcheon's Apple Products Inc. by building a new retail-office center on his 1.2-acre parcel in Frederick, Md.
McCutcheon has sketches of the three-story center, with a water wheel at the base, a fort-style tower rising high above the roof and an apple design on top. He figures it would cost $7 million to construct and would allow him to add 10 workers to his 30-employee firm.
The problem is he can't find enough businesses to sign up as tenants inside the 35,000-square-foot building. So the project is on hold. And without tenants, McCutcheon has no plans to bulk up his payroll.
"I'll try to avoid hiring more people," said McCutcheon, whose family has been running the business since 1938. "I'll upgrade my machinery rather than add more people. It's a lot easier to manage machines."
That sort of thinking, of course, isn't unique to McCutcheon or to small businesses. Squeezing more output from existing workers -- that is, increasing productivity -- has been a central strategy for most businesses for years, including the corporate giants.
Adding to the uncertainties for businesses of all sizes are the shaky global economy and the prospects of higher taxes to deal with the federal deficit and higher costs to deal with healthcare and the recent government overhaul of financial regulations.
The upshot is that the typical small-business owner sees a lot of reasons to sit tight.
Joy Staveley of Flagstaff, Ariz., said it was clear to her why people are more scared to take a risk on a new business: There are more regulations, taxes and government-mandated costs -- and fears of more to come -- with President George W. Bush's tax cuts expiring soon, new healthcare rules and pending legislation on energy.
"I've seen poor economies in the past, and I can deal with it," said Staveley, who with her husband has been running Canyoneers, a Grand Canyon river-rafting business, for 30 years. "But what I can't get through is a runaway government."
Such sentiments are not uncommon among many small-business operators, the bulk of them conservatives who believe Washington does not understand or respond to their needs.
"I really feel small businesses have been put on the back burner," said Mike Bailey, owner of Car Doctor, an auto-repair shop in downtown Oklahoma City.
Business has picked up this year, Bailey said, and he's prepared to add workers if he can expand into a bigger place. But he admits to being gun-shy.
"To be frank, I'm a little timid," he said. "We experienced fast growth in the '90s, and then we experienced the worst of the worst. It really keeps me from investing."

Full text: William L. Taylor didn't necessarily look the part of a leading civil rights advocate, a matter he addressed in his memoir under the heading "A White Guy Like Me," as in: "What leads a white guy like me to spend his life working on behalf of black people?"
Growing up Jewish in Brooklyn during an "era of anti-Semitism" while the Holocaust raged in Europe helped shape his future, he wrote. Another early lesson in civil rights came from following the "career and courage" of Jackie Robinson as he broke major league baseball's color line in 1947.
For more than 50 years, Taylor played a major role in drafting and defending civil rights legislation. One career highlight came early: He helped craft the 1958 Supreme Court brief that resulted in Little Rock., Ark., schools being forced to maintain desegregation.
Taylor died Monday at a Bethesda, Md., hospital of complications from a fall, said Rabbi Ethan Seidel of Tifereth Israel Congregation, which Taylor attended in Washington. He was 78.
"His contributions to the desegregation of our nation's education system were unparalleled and invaluable," Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said in a statement.
U.S. Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, called Taylor "a pioneer in education" and a "true hero" whose "relentless pursuit of equality was evident in everything he did."
Graduating from Yale Law School in 1954, one month after the Supreme Court first ordered the desegregation of schools in Brown vs. Board of Education, was "fortuitous," Taylor once said. The landmark decision moved him to pursue civil rights work.
He began his career as an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York, working with Thurgood Marshall, who would become the first black Supreme Court justice.
They knew they were making history, Taylor later said, with the Arkansas case. The local school board had suspended integration at a Little Rock high school after widespread violence and civil disorder.
"At issue was the rule of the law.... Would we permit, even temporarily, mob rule?" Taylor recalled in a 1999 interview. "The court ruled unanimously in our favor," making it clear that desegregation was the law of the land.
During the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, he served on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and directed research that contributed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.
After leading the commission from 1965 to 1968, he taught civil rights law for 15 years at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he founded the Center for National Policy Review, a civil rights research and advocacy organization.
In the 1980s, Taylor played a key role as vice chairman of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, working on national legislative campaigns that strengthened major civil rights laws.
He also served as chairman of the Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights, a watchdog group he helped found in 1982.
After entering private practice in 1986, he continued to advocate for equality in education.
One of his biggest cases resulted in the establishment in St. Louis of the largest metropolitan school desegregation plan.
The son of immigrants from Lithuania, William Lewis Taylor was born in 1931 in Brooklyn. His father was a civil engineer.
In first grade, he was taunted as a "Christ-killer" by Italian boys in the neighborhood, he recalled in his 2004 memoir, "The Passion of My Times."
After winning $7,000 on the TV game show "Tic Tac Dough" in the 1950s, he testified before the grand jury when the quiz-show scandal broke and learned that he had won more money than anyone else who had played honestly, Taylor wrote in his memoir.
He earned a bachelor's degree at Brooklyn College in 1952 and had what he called "a character-building experience" when the administration shut down the campus paper, which was criticized as too independent.
When the college paid tribute to him in 2001, Taylor said, "I learned that you could speak out for things you believed in and that nothing bad would happen to you. I have spent my life doing that."
Taylor's wife of 43 years, the former Harriett Rosen, who was a Superior Court judge in Washington, died in 1997 at the age of 65.
His survivors include his three children, Lauren, Debbie and David.

Abstract: While many Democrats believe Afghanistan is the right war to fight, Obama's decision to add another 30,000 troops last winter posed a difficult choice. Because of deepening economic distress at home combined with political and military setbacks in Afghanistan, some Democrats see the military venture as a war without end that they cannot philosophically or economically support.

Full text: The moment has been long in coming, but it may finally have arrived.
For the past year and a half, on issues including health care, financial reform and climate change, Democrats in Congress have bent for President Barack Obama. Liberals swallowed hard to accept compromises that fell short of their long-sought goals, while moderates cast tough votes that now threaten their re-election prospects as voters revolt against government overreach.
Then, last week, the president asked them to bend yet again -- this time to approve more money for his troop surge in an Afghanistan war that many Democrats oppose.
And once again, lawmakers went to work. On the eve of the vote last week, Democratic leaders compiled a complicated $82 billion package of war funding, disaster aid and domestic spending that achieved the seemingly impossible -- meeting the president's request while accommodating the needs of its politically diverse members.
Obama responded with a one-word message that sent shudders through his party on Capitol Hill: Veto.
In that exchange, the tension between the White House and the president's Democratic allies spilled over.
Obama has wrangled what historians have called the most productive Congress since Lyndon Johnson, but he will have a much harder time extracting difficult compromises in the future.
"You've got a lot of people doing a lot of heavy lifting here," said freshman Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. "I don't know that we expected flowers and chocolates," he said. But the president's response "was an unwelcome message."
In recent weeks, the president has expressed growing interest in the remaining items on his legislative agenda, including energy and immigration policy. Both are initiatives whose only hope at passage would require another legislative squeeze from the same lawmakers who have already yielded to some of the president's toughest asks.
Yet compromise will be difficult as lawmakers approach the midterm election when they, not the president, must fight for their political lives in a tough electoral climate.
"There's no question we've taken on big policy issues," said Rep. Allyson Schwartz, D-Pa. "Each time we reach a heavy lift we think, 'How are we going to do more?' We do."
Perhaps no issue illustrates the divide between the president and his party as the Afghanistan war, a military campaign that many Democrats opposed even as Obama made it his own.
Liberals fought former President George W. Bush on the war in Iraq. Some Democrats won their seats in the 2006 and 2008 elections doing so. While many Democrats believe Afghanistan is the right war to fight, Obama's decision to add another 30,000 troops last winter posed a difficult choice.
Because of deepening economic distress at home combined with political and military setbacks in Afghanistan, some Democrats see the military venture as a war without end that they cannot philosophically or economically support.
"I would rather do a little bit more nation-building here at home," said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. The $37 billion approved for the war would pay for proposals to extend jobless benefits for the unemployed.
Pragmatic liberal lawmakers at least wanted to use the emergency spending bill as a way to win approval for recession aid that would be difficult to pass otherwise as voters grow increasingly concerned about spending and the national debt.
But the White House threatened late Thursday to veto the package if it contained any antiwar provisions or cut programs favored by Obama to pay for teachers' salaries.
The bill now heads to the Senate, as House Democrats were furious at an administration that many see as tone deaf to the political realities facing lawmakers in a November electoral climate that is not expected to be friendly to incumbents.
"The White House needs to be more engaged with the House's agenda," said Rep. Steve Cohen, an antiwar Democrat from Tennessee. "The House is where its friends are."
As Obama turns to these same friends in the weeks ahead, he may find it increasingly difficult to persuade them to yield in the way that will be required to achieve his remaining priorities.
Then again, Obama has had a historically successful legislative run, signing into law the economic stimulus package, health care restructuring and, perhaps soon, the Wall Street overhaul, along with a long list of lesser known bills on credit card reform, tobacco regulation and fair pay. So the uneasy mood on Capitol Hill may not matter.
"It is the end of the road," Matthew Bennett, executive director at Third Way, a think tank in Washington. "But they're at the end of the list."

Full text: This may seem like any other quiet little river town, but its past could fill a history book -- and a fascinating one at that. And the history isn't dead.
About 60 miles south of St. Louis on the Great River Road and 360 miles southwest of Chicago, Ste. Genevieve is a charming, slow-paced reminder of the French presence in America during the 18th century.
Missouri's first permanent European settlement, Ste. Genevieve was settled in the late 1740s by descendants of French Canadians who fled British control and followed the Mississippi River Valley routes of Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet south to French-controlled Illinois Country. The site they chose offered expansive river bottomland, which provided rich soil along with sources of furs, lead and salt. Here, farmers, fur traders and miners built a farming town that they named for the patron saint of Paris. French language, culture and faith thrived, and within a generation the town was prospering as the breadbasket of the territory.
In 1762, Ste. Genevieve fell under Spanish control when the French ceded their rights to land west of the Mississippi to Spain, until they regained the territory in 1800. Many of the town's lasting structures were built during this era. Called "French Creole colonial" buildings, they are large central structures supported by vertical log posts and surrounded with deep porches designed to catch cooling breezes and provide extra storage.
Soon after 1803, when the Louisiana Purchase ceded lands west of the Mississippi to the United States, Ste. Genevieve became the "most wealthy village in Louisiana," according to Frederick Bates, secretary of the Louisiana Territory.
In the 19th century, English and German immigrants made their way to the area, bringing trade and shopkeeping and adding distinctive red-brick homes and shops to the townscape.
Today, Ste. Genevieve, population 4,400, claims 150 pre-1825 structures, the largest collection of French colonial buildings in the U.S. The town is part of the French Colonial District, which includes Fort de Chartres, once the area's capital, and Prairie du Rocher and Cahokia, two other old French settlements across the river in Illinois.
Over the years, the Mississippi has played havoc with Ste. Genevieve. In 1785, devastating floods forced the townsfolk to move from the riverbanks to higher ground inland, its present location. Even so, the town's historic district was inundated by 15 feet of water during the "500-year flood" of 1993. Today a 25-foot-high, 31/2-mile-long levee completed in 2001 separates the atmospheric old town from the Mississippi.
Besides touring the town's historic buildings. you can browse Market, Merchant and Third streets for antiques and local art, or you can golf, hike, bike and tour wineries. You can cross the Mississippi by ferry and explore more of the French Colonial District in Illinois.
Don't expect Ste. Genevieve to look like Colonial Williamsburg or a classic 18th century French village. The town has a simpler but no less interesting Midwestern ambience.
For starters, visit the Ste. Genevieve Tourist Office (800-373-7007, stegenevieve.org) at Main and Market streets for local information.
Then stroll along Main Street and get a sense of Ste. Genevieve's history by touring three treasured buildings that make up the Bolduc House Museum: the Bolduc House, the LeMeilleur House and the Linden House. (573-883-3105, bolduchouse.com)
The Bolduc House at 125 S. Main, a National Historic Landmark built in 1785, is noted for its hand-hewn vertical log (poteaux-sur-solle) construction with a cedar shake, hipped roof.
Inside are 18th century French colonial artifacts and furniture, some pieces said to have been owned by Louis Bolduc, a miner, merchant and farmer who was the town's richest man. The LeMeilleur House, built in 1820, later served as a convent school and a blacksmith's shop, but it, like the other homes, has been restored. Linden House, also built in 1820, now serves as the museum's office, shop and library. Charming Bolduc Gardens, inside the LeMeilleur gate, has a few apple trees, a chestnut tree, a grape arbor and a French herb and vegetable garden. Museum admission: $5 for adults, $2 for students.
Among the other historic buildings: Bauvais-Amoureux House (1792), with upright cedar log walls; Felix Valle House (1818) State Historic Site, a Federal-style limestone structure and the Jacques Guibourd House (1806), another vertical log residence. The town's Memorial Cemetery was established in 1787. Ste. Genevieve Catholic Church, built on the site of the original, celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2009.
What else to see, do
* Kaskaskia Bell on Kaskaskia Island: It's in the only Illinois community west of the Mississippi and accessible only through Missouri. Known as the Liberty Bell of the West, it was cast in France in 1741, a gift from King Louis XV to the Mission of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church. The bell, cracked during the 1993 flood, is housed in a tiny brick building next to the church. (state.il.us/hpa/hs/fort(underscore) kaskaskia.htm)
* Wineries: French and German settlers brought winemaking to this temperate region. Today about a half-dozen wineries produce a variety of local specialties (missouriwinecountry.com /southeast). Sainte Genevieve Winery, 245 Merchant St., is a convenient place for a tasting or having a picnic in the shade of a grape arbor. Chaumette Vineyards, about 20 miles out of town, is a boutique winery with elegant extras: 26 one-bedroom villas ($200-$225 per night in summer); a spa, pool, fitness center and the Grapevine Grill restaurant for fine dining. (573-747-1000, chaumette.com)
* Parks: For outdoor recreation, your choices include the rolling wilderness of Hawn State Park with its cooling River Aux Vases and Pickle Creek, hiking trails and picnic areas; Magnolia Hollow State Park, with steep bluffs and expansive scenic river views; and Pickle Springs Natural Area, with sandstone geological shapes.
* The Modoc Ferry (locally called the French Connection): It shuttles vehicles between Ste. Genevieve and Modoc, Ill. One-way crossing for an auto or van is $10 (573-547-8357). It's a 15-mile drive to Fort de Chartres Historic Site (618-284-7230, ftdechartres.com), offering an impressive French colonial experience within the partially rebuilt 18th century stone and wood fort.

If you go
Where to eat
You won't starve in the historic district, nor will you feel you're dining in Paris or Chicago. And you won't go broke. A few options: Restaurant St. Gemme Beauvais, a white-tablecloth place with its most expensive entree at $20; Anvil Saloon, operating since 1855; Old Brick House, noted for its fried chicken.
Where to stay
Best option is a B&B in the historic district. Top ones are Dr. Hertich's House (he was one of the town's first physicians), with prices between $89 and $189. Inn St. Gemme Beauvais rates are $99 to $189. Both use 800-818-5744 for reservations. If you want something more modest, Microtel Inn & Suites has rooms starting at $69 a night. 888-771-7171.
Extending your stay
If you need a city fix, drive north to St. Louis, with its soaring Gateway Arch, terrific museums, interesting neighborhoods and restaurants, and, of course, the Cardinals (800-916-8938, explorestlouis.com).

Full text: Though he is quick to deride President George W. Bush's performance in office, President Obama seems to think his predecessor gives a pretty good immigration speech.
Obama's widely publicized speech on the controversial topic Thursday closely tracks, in rhetoric and basic policy, a speech Bush gave on the same subject in May 2006.
Speaking at American University, Obama delivered an address intended to rally the nation behind a plan that would strengthen border security while providing a path to legal status for the estimated 12 million people living in the U.S. illegally.
Obama's speech was longer than the one Bush delivered four years ago -- 4,100 words compared with 2,600. Bush, speaking from the Oval Office, did not have to expend words thanking people. And Obama used the occasion to recap victories on healthcare and education.
But in fundamental ways, the speeches carry the same message. The parallels show the two presidents -- one a Republican, the other a Democrat -- have staked out basically the same centrist position on immigration.
The speeches also reveal similarities in ways presidents of both parties communicate with the public.
After reading a transcript of Obama's immigration address, former Bush speechwriter Matt Latimer said in an e-mail that "this speech could almost word for word have been delivered by George W. Bush on the exact same subject.ADo they just copy our old speeches?"
Latimer, who wrote a book called "Speech-Less" that was critical of the Bush speechwriting operation, added, "That's not a compliment."
The policy similarities are not that surprising. Bush, even before he ran for president, was at odds with many in his party on immigration. As governor of Texas, he challenged Republicans -- including the California governor at the time, Pete Wilson -- who took a hard line on immigration and wanted a crackdown on illegal immigrants.
Bush's position was ultimately repudiated by his party, and he was repeatedly rebuffed by Republicans in Congress when he offered proposals for tightening borders but also creating a path to citizenship for immigrants.
A White House official said Friday he did not believe that anyone examined Bush's old speeches while drafting the Obama address. Rather, the speech was written by a member of the president's speechwriting team, with Obama providing "a good deal of writing," the official said.
Both speeches talk about immigrants who "live in the shadows." Both mention immigrants who came to the U.S. in search of "a better life." Both describe the U.S. as "a nation of immigrants" and reject calls to "round up" people who are here illegally.
And both use the same language about business. Obama said businesses "must be held accountable" for hiring undocumented workers; Bush said, "We need to hold employers to account."
Plunging into the body of his speech, Obama discussed how "in recent days the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country." That's a reference to the strict new anti-illegal immigration law in Arizona, which has touched off protests and lawsuits.
Bush, in his speech, alluded to a wave of street protests in favor of an immigration overhaul, saying, "The issue of immigration stirs intense emotions, and in recent weeks, Americans have seen those emotions on display."
Neither Bush nor Obama wanted to be seen as neglecting border enforcement. Obama said that "government has a threshold responsibility to secure our borders," whereas Bush said that securing the border is "a basic responsibility of a sovereign state."
Each president laid out steps they'd taken to prevent illegal crossings, using the same multipliers. Bush said he "doubled" the size of the Border Patrol; Obama said that he "doubled" the personnel assigned to border enforcement security "task forces."
Yet neither claimed that the borders are impregnable. Bush said, "We do not yet have full control of the border." Obama said that the Mexican border is more secure than ever, but acknowledged that "that doesn't mean we don't have more work to do."
Both speeches use a device in which they rejected what they portrayed as extreme positions -- blanket amnesty on the one hand, and deportation of all illegal immigrants on the other.
Instead of those extremes, each president said, the country should adopt a more moderate alternative in which illegal immigrants could gain legal status by meeting tough requirements.
Bush said immigrants must "pay their taxes" and "learn English." Obama used the same language -- "pay their taxes" and "learn English," among other things.
And at some point in each speech, the president told an inspiring story of an immigrant who came to the U.S., joined the military and gained citizenship.
Bush mentioned Guadalupe Denogean from Mexico, who joined the Marines and was wounded in Iraq.
Obama's example was Perla Ramos, who came to the U.S. from Mexico after the Sept. 11 attacks, joined the Navy and became a citizen.

Abstract: A 6-year-old girl in Ohio had mistakenly been put on a no-fly list; a man from the Indian city of Kurukshetra who had studied in Texas was bucking tradition back home by encouraging American-style displays of the Indian flag; the government in New Delhi had raised ire with a requirement that naturalized Americans surrender their Indian passports and pay a fee before being allowed to travel to India. Unlike shows on Indian satellite subscription channels that are heavy on soap operas and Bollywood musicals produced in India, "Darshan" targets the interests of immigrants and native Americans of South Asian descent.

Full text: In a small television studio in a Falls Church strip mall, tucked between Victory Fabric and the Marhaba Market Butcher Shop and Gifts, Ramesh Butani and Aastha Verma were bursting with news.
A 6-year-old girl in Ohio had mistakenly been put on a no-fly list; a man from the Indian city of Kurukshetra who had studied in Texas was bucking tradition back home by encouraging American-style displays of the Indian flag; the government in New Delhi had raised ire with a requirement that naturalized Americans surrender their Indian passports and pay a fee before being allowed to travel to India.
As they presented each topic, Butani, 65, and his co-host Verma, 36, gushed their praise or tsked disapprovingly.
But alongside the usual on-camera adrenaline, there was an extra thrill in the air. After 23 years of broadcasting to viewers in the Washington area, their one-hour talk show, "Darshan," has spawned "Darshan America," a half-hour version appearing in about 30 markets nationwide. Its first show aired Saturday. It can be seen in the District on Channel 271 on Comcast, 470 on Cox and 30 on RCN.
It is a triumph for "Darshan," which means "morning blessing" in Hindi. The show is one of 15 locally produced programs aired by the Falls Church-based MHz Networks, but it is the first to be broadcast outside its home market, on the company's channel geared to diaspora communities and viewers interested in foreign programs.
"Quite frankly, it's the only one that has the quality of content and production standards that meet the level that it's able to go national," said Chris Arth, editor and director of "Darshan" and a producer at MHz, which also airs international programming such as "Al Jazeera English," "France 24" and "Russia Today."
For Indian American families in the Washington area, the weekly show, which airs Saturday mornings on WNVC, has been a staple -- especially in its early days, when South Asians rarely saw themselves represented in the mainstream media.
"It was one of the few ways the community could get news about itself," said Verma, an information technology consultant who grew up in Greenbelt and Bowie.
Verma's parents used to wake her up on Saturday mornings to watch the show. Initially she grumbled, but eventually she grew interested in the segments.
"I used to call the show as a young girl," she said of correcting errors she caught and suggesting new angles to stories. The habit eventually bore fruit. After hearing from her so often, Hansa Butani, Ramesh's wife and the show's producer, asked her whether she would be interested in appearing on the program.
Now, "people call us the Regis [Philbin] and Kelly Ripa of Indian television," said Verma, who shares the co-host position with another woman, Shilpa Alimchandani.
Unlike shows on Indian satellite subscription channels that are heavy on soap operas and Bollywood musicals produced in India, "Darshan" targets the interests of immigrants and native Americans of South Asian descent. That includes a few Bollywood music videos to bracket the program, but mostly talk.
The show takes on cultural taboos such as teenage dating, mixed marriages, Viagra and homosexuality, sometimes stirring up debates that end up on the editorial pages of local Indian newspapers.
MHz estimates that the show has about 700,000 viewers locally, although it does not break them down by household. The national version will be available to more than 31 million U.S. homes.
Seated against a backdrop of the American flag, the Capitol, the White House and the Washington Monument, Butani, an avuncular man with a tidy gray goatee, addresses his audience as "folks," his English betraying only the faintest tinge of India, which he left in 1969. Like most on "Darshan's" eight-member team, he has another job, as president of a construction firm. He has hosted "Darshan" for more than 20 years.
The audience is not limited to South Asians. The show has received letters from European, Latin American and Caribbean immigrants.
"They all enjoy it because, A, it's in English, and B, it's the immigrants' perspective," Butani said. For example, the show often discusses immigration law.
Butani's segment, "In Conversation," consists of news filtered through an Indian American point of view. Another segment, "Morning Blend," features younger hosts, usually local college students. Many have gone on to media careers.
The show tries to transcend stereotypes. It has aired interviews with Indian filmmaker Mira Nair and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), who is of Indian descent.
"What people used to think of India -- an exotic land of snake charmers -- now it's Bollywood and the IT industry," Verma said. "I think this show is just a little ahead of that."
As the show expands to cities such as Chicago, Seattle and Nashville, Butani hopes it will become a required stopping point for Indian celebrities and politicians.
"My wish for the national show is that it will be where the prominent Indian Americans nationally make a stop here in Washington, D.C., to be on the show -- just like that Rose, Charlie Rose."
Verma said she hopes the expanded broadcasting will be helpful to young women -- especially those living in areas with few Indian Americans.
"There's a lot of Indian girls who struggle to find their identity," she said. "If they see a show where they can identify with someone like me, someone who represents India and who is well spoken and presents herself well, now they have some kind of role model. . . . Hopefully they will feel less alone."

Full text: BAGHDAD -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. drew an analogy to the signers of the Declaration of Independence on Sunday in exhorting Iraqi leaders to end the paralysis that has stalled the formation of a government since the parliamentary elections four months ago.
"When they signed that declaration, many of them did not even like one another," Mr. Biden, making his fourth trip to Baghdad as vice president, told a group of Iraqi leaders at a Fourth of July reception at the residence of the United States ambassador, Christopher R. Hill. "My plea to you is to continue what you started," he said.
Mr. Biden's visit came amid grumbling by some Iraqi officials that American policy in Iraq has lately lacked focus, as the United States withdraws large numbers of troops at a time of political dysfunction and daily violence. There is no sign that the deadlocked coalitions that won seats in the March elections are any closer to forming a government.
That Iraq is still a violent land was evident Sunday when less than three hours after Mr. Biden's remarks mortar explosions were heard near the fortified Green Zone area that includes the United States Embassy compound. Officials said Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill, were safe, although it remained unclear late Sunday whether anyone else had been hurt.
Earlier Sunday, a woman blew herself up in Ramadi, the provincial capital of Anbar Province, detonating explosives hidden in her underwear, the police said. The explosion went off in a waiting room next to the provincial governor's office, and four people were killed.
Mr. Biden has visited Iraq 17 times since 2003, when he was still a senator, and has seen the country evolve from an occupied war zone to a bloody sectarian battlefield to a fragile democracy. His latest visit has required a delicate diplomatic dance of trying to subtly influence Iraq's internal politics while not appearing to impugn the nation's sovereignty.
"You should not, and I'm sure you will not, let any state, from the United States to any state in the region, dictate what will become of you all," Mr. Biden said in his reception remarks. It was a statement that was clearly a reference to neighboring Iran, which was not shy about publicly entering the Iraqi political fray in the postelection period. Like Iraq, Iran is dominated by Shiites.
Mr. Biden's public schedule on Sunday began with a ceremony to award citizenship to immigrant American soldiers in the marble rotunda of a palace that once served as Saddam Hussein's hunting lodge. He noted that he was bestowing American citizenship in a building that housed a dictator who "stood for everything that we don't stand for."
"I find it delicious that that's happening," he said.
Later, his entourage flew in a procession of helicopters from Camp Victory near the airport to the Green Zone, for meetings with Iraqi leaders. He first met with Ayad Allawi, the former interim prime minister, whose Iraqiya coalition won the most seats in Parliament, although less than a majority required to form a government.
In a statement released by the office of Deputy Prime Minister Rafi al-Essawi, who hosted the meeting, Mr. Allawi said: "During the meeting, we focused on the situation in the country and the region and the need to accelerate the formation of the government. There were no specific proposals from the U.S. side."
Mr. Biden's motorcade then snaked through the Green Zone to the home of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who lives in a neighborhood of waterways known as Little Venice. Afterward, a member of Mr. Maliki's political party, Khalid al-Assadi, said in a statement that the "process of forming a government is going on quietly."
At the embassy cocktail reception, Mr. Biden drew on his evolving perception of the country, informed from his previous visits, and cited Baghdad's notorious traffic jams as an example of progress. He said that during his last visit, he noticed from the window of his helicopter "bumper to bumper" traffic.
"Welcome to peace and democracy," Mr. Biden said. "But it is the most significant sign that life and commerce and celebration has returned."
Nonetheless, in a sign of how much further Iraq must go, he did not venture beyond the secure bubbles of the massive army base at Camp Victory or the barricaded streets of the Green Zone.

Full text: Every morning during television coverage of the World Cup, on the Mexican equivalent of the "Today" show, co-hosts chat, trade barbs and yuck it up. Behind them, actors in blackface makeup, dressed in fake animal skins and wild "Afro" wigs, gyrate, wave spears and pretend to represent a cartoonish version of South Africa.
Yes, in the 21st century, blackface characters on a major television network.
But this is Mexico, and definitions of racism are complicated and influenced by the country's own tortured relationship with invading powers and indigenous cultures.
Many Mexicans will say they are not racist and that very little racism exists in Mexico, a nation, after all, of mestizos, who are of European and indigenous blood.
As proof, they point to the fact that slavery was ended in Mexico decades before it was abolished in the United States, and that Mexico never institutionalized racism the way the U.S. did with its segregationist laws that lasted into the 1960s.
It is true that Mexico was even seen as a refuge for some American blacks. Poet Langston Hughes did some of his earliest writing while living briefly with his father in Mexico, where the older man had gone to escape discrimination.
But the full truth is that racism is alive and well in Mexico. It is primarily directed at indigenous communities who account for as many as 11.3 million people, or roughly 10% of the national population. The indigenous remain disproportionately mired in poverty and denied work, political access, education and other rights.
And there is a smaller community of black Mexicans, Afro Mexicanos, many descendants of slaves first brought to the region by Spanish conquerors in the 16th century.
Often referred to by academics as the "third race" and concentrated in the coastal states of Veracruz, Oaxaca and Guerrero, they have been fighting for years for recognition as a distinct ethnic group, to be included in history books and to be given opportunities to transcend poverty.
"Racism in Mexico is covered up," said Ricardo Bucio, head of the National Council for the Prevention of Discrimination, which has protested the blackface TV caricatures. "There is a lot of denial about it."
Or, as columnist Katia D'Artigues once put it: "Although subtle, discrimination has become something invisible in our society. We no longer see it, or we consider it normal!"
Still, in Mexico and other parts of Latin America, people operate with a different comfort level when it comes to physical attributes. It remains common for Mexicans to use nicknames like "Chino" for someone with almond-shaped eyes, "Negrito" for someone with dark skin, "Gordo" (Fatso) for a plump person.
These terms are jarring when seen through the prism of U.S. sensibilities, but here they are usually used in a context of affection and friendship.
The issue of racism in Mexico exploded a few years back when then-President Vicente Fox, in what was meant to be a defense of Mexican immigration to the United States, told a U.S. audience that Mexican immigrants were necessary because they performed the jobs that "not even blacks" wanted to do.
He had to apologize and receive a visit from Jesse Jackson to atone. As the furor died down, another popped up when Mexico printed postage stamps that commemorated a well-known comic-book character from the 1950s, Memin Pinguin. The character is a black boy drawn with exaggerated features. It was seen as racist by many in the U.S. who demanded Mexico withdraw the stamps; many in Mexico, including several leftist intellectuals, defended Memin Pinguin as a beloved part of Mexican culture. (Withdrawing the stamps became a moot point when they sold out within hours of going on market.)
The people at Televisa, Mexico's preeminent broadcasting company, say they mean absolutely no harm with the blackface characters on their morning chat show. It's just a spoof, they say, a humorous segment when the news is over but the day's World Cup match hasn't yet started, and shouldn't be taken seriously. After all, one of the co-hosts is a green-haired clown. More "Saturday Night Live" than "Good Morning America."
The ratings, by the way, are through the roof, Televisa adds.
For Friday's game between Holland and Brazil, viewers in Mexico, minutes after the morning dose of blackface, saw the two teams read a pledge against discrimination and parade with a huge banner that said: "No to racism."

Abstract: William L. Taylor didn't necessarily look the part of a leading civil rights advocate, a matter he addressed in his memoir under the heading "A White Guy Like Me," as in: "What leads a white guy like me to spend his life working on behalf of black people?" Growing up Jewish in Brooklyn while the Holocaust raged in Europe helped shape his future, he wrote.

Full text: William L. Taylor didn't necessarily look the part of a leading civil rights advocate, a matter he addressed in his memoir under the heading "A White Guy Like Me," as in: "What leads a white guy like me to spend his life working on behalf of black people?"
Growing up Jewish in Brooklyn while the Holocaust raged in Europe helped shape his future, he wrote. Another early lesson in civil rights came from following the "career and courage" of Jackie Robinson as he broke Major League Baseball's color line in 1947.
For more than 50 years, Mr. Taylor played a major role in drafting and defending civil rights legislation. One career highlight came early: He helped craft a 1958 brief to the Supreme Court that ultimately resulted in Little Rock, Ark., schools being forced to maintain desegregation.
Mr. Taylor died June 28 at a Bethesda, Md., hospital of complications from a fall, said Rabbi Ethan Seidel of Tifereth Israel Congregation, which Mr. Taylor attended in Washington. He was 78.
"His contributions to the desegregation of our nation's education system were unparalleled and invaluable," Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said in a statement.
Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, called Mr. Taylor "a pioneer in education" and a "true hero" whose "relentless pursuit of equality was evident in everything he did."
Graduating from Yale Law School in 1954, one month after the Supreme Court first ordered the desegregation of schools in Brown v. Board of Education, was "fortuitous," Mr. Taylor once said. The landmark decision moved him to pursue civil rights work.
He began his career as an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in New York, working with Thurgood Marshall, who would become the first black Supreme Court justice.
They knew they were making history, Mr. Taylor later said, with the Arkansas case. The local school board had suspended integration at a Little Rock high school after widespread violence and civil disorder.
"At issue was the rule of the law ... . Would we permit, even temporarily, mob rule?" he recalled in a 1999 interview. "The court ruled unanimously in our favor," making it clear that desegregation was the law of the land.
During the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, he served on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and directed research that contributed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.
After leading the commission from 1965 to 1968, he taught civil rights law for 15 years at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he founded the Center for National Policy Review, a civil rights research and advocacy organization.
Mr. Taylor played a key role as vice chairman of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, working on national legislative campaigns that strengthened major civil rights laws. He also served as chairman of the Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights, a watchdog group he helped found in 1982.
After entering private practice in 1986, he continued to advocate for equality in education. One of his biggest cases resulted in the establishment in St. Louis of the largest metropolitan school desegregation plan.
The son of immigrants from Lithuania, William Lewis Taylor was born in 1931 in Brooklyn. His father was a civil engineer.
In first grade, he was taunted as a "Christ-killer" by Italian boys in the neighborhood, he recalled in his 2004 memoir, "The Passion of My Times."
After winning $7,000 on the TV game show "Tic Tac Dough" in the 1950s, he testified before the grand jury when the quiz-show scandal broke and learned that he had won more money than anyone else who had played honestly, he wrote in his memoir.
He earned a bachelor's degree at Brooklyn College in 1952 and had what he called "a character-building experience" when the administration shut down the campus paper, criticized as too independent.
When the college paid tribute to him in 2001, Mr. Taylor said, "I learned that you could speak out for things you believed in and that nothing bad would happen to you. I have spent my life doing that."
His survivors include his three children, Lauren, Debbie and David.

Full text: A rollicking party on the Mall celebrated America's 234th birthday Sunday with folklore and Frisbees, soccer games, Christian rock and a star-studded concert, punctuating the nation's diversity with verve in a multicultural mosaic.
Unlike in recent years, when Independence Day crowds dodged raindrops, blue skies gave way to a crystal-clear evening as people gathered at picnics and parades, munched on ethnic dishes on the Mall and lined up along the banks of the Potomac River to view the capital's pyrotechnic extravaganza.
For some, the day was the perfect culmination of Americana, past and present.
"This is our country's picnic, Main Street parade, jam session and sports day all rolled into one," said Chauncey Johnson, who, with his wife, Tammy, had driven to the District from suburban Philadelphia. As he waited in line to enter the festivities at the east end of the Mall, headlined by Gladys Knight and the Pips, he added: "Look at it. . . . It's every slice of American life right here."
Blocks away at the White House, President Obama celebrated the holiday -- which also marked his daughter Malia's 12th birthday -- with a South Lawn picnic of hamburgers, hot dogs and watermelon pops. Many of the more than 1,000 guests were members of the military.
On the Mall, festivities began in the late morning as crowds transformed the green expanse into a marketplace. Couples lay on blankets in the shade.
At every turn, the day bespoke the Fourth of July. There were the sights: red coolers, white sun hats and blue beach towels. And the sounds: the thump and bass of high school marching bands, the calls from Hare Krishna floats and the rhythms of mariachi bands.
There was no official estimate of the huge crowd. U.S. Park Police, who no longer estimate the size of Mall gatherings, had anticipated that a half-million people would attend the festivities, which included the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. Park Police detailed hundreds of officers and rangers to control crowds and confiscate alcohol.
Although the mercury soared into the 90s, many said a subtle afternoon breeze helped keep the day from being a scorcher.
"Shoot, I remember, was it 2003? 2004? You could barely move it was so bad out here," said Janice Torrance of Capitol Heights as she sat on a towel with her sons, Nile and London.
Still, many found innovative ways to cool off. Teresa Cho and her three children soaked their feet in a small ice chest after walking the length of the Mall.
"Didn't expect to do this, but desperate times . . . " Cho said.
Thousands poured into the Mall's museums for the exhibits as well as the air conditioning.
"I've been in this museum I can't tell you how many times, but right now, the cold marble is all I care about," said Robert Tolbert, 45, who stood in line at the National Air and Space Museum with his wife, Vicky, and their three children. The former Washingtonians, who live in northern Michigan, said they didn't miss their District summers -- except for the July Fourth festivities.
"Just how I remember it. It's very comforting, actually," said Vicky Tolbert, 44. With "all the things the country has gone through, and is going through, it's nice to have this be something that remains consistent."
The region's festivities began with another tradition: politicians seeking votes. At the annual parade in the Northwest Washington neighborhood of Palisades, the lineup was dominated by elected officials, many of them running in coming contests.
As the politicians marched along MacArthur Boulevard, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) and his supporters threw Mardi Gras-type beads and stickers into the crowd. Fenty and his backers were followed by supporters of D.C. Council Chairman Vincent C. Gray (D), his main rival in his reelection bid; council members Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) and Phil Mendelson (D-At Large); and others.
"The ratio of politicians to everything else is too high," said Beatrice Meyerson, a longtime resident. "It's more fun to watch bands and kids."
Back at the Mall, the musical entertainment and fireworks were big crowd-pleasers.
Actually, to Mary Brandenburg of Northern Virginia, the pyrotechnics were "a little hard on the ears." But her 7-year-old granddaughter, Emma Wickett, proclaimed the show "awesome."
It was the first Independence Day trip to the Mall for Amelia Torrez, 37, of Stockton, Calif. An immigrant from Colombia, she has lived in the United States for nearly seven years and became a citizen late last year.
Torrez said she promised herself she would make the trip to Washington after becoming a citizen because she went through the immigration process and wanted to treat herself to a celebration.
"This is what you dream of, being a part of this kind of celebration," she said. "It's nice to take part in what's typically American."

Tight credit markets have slammed small businesses during the recession. That leaves entrepreneurs like Cecilia Aspiazu, who sells clothing and beauty products out of her home in Jamaica, Queens, increasingly turning to microloans.
"I'm fixing it little by little," Ms. Aspiazu says of her shaky credit. "I would like to get a bank loan one day. I want to open a store."
In the meantime, Ms. Aspiazu, a 63-year-old from Colombia, is borrowing little amounts at a time. She is about to pay off her second loan for $2,000 from Grameen America, a microfinance organization that provides small loans mostly to immigrant women. Ms. Aspiazu plans to take out a third loan this August for $2,500.
Microfinance organizations such as Grameen America are expanding services in New York, amid growing demand. Applications for loans in 2009 were up at 66% of the U.S. microfinance organizations surveyed by the Aspen Institute, a policy and research organization.
Critics, however, say that the industry still faces challenges and may never achieve wide-scale success in the U.S.
"The big difference is that it is a lot harder to be a smaller scale entrepreneur" in the U.S. than overseas, said Jonathan Morduch, professor of public policy and economics at New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.
Interest rates also vary widely. Most U.S. nonprofit microfinance organizations offer loans with interest rates between 8% and 14%. International organizations often charge between 30% and 60%, said Elaine Edgcomb, director of the Aspen Institute's microenterprise Fund for Innovation, Effectiveness, Learning and Dissemination.
The Grameen franchise was one of the founders of the microfinance movement. It started more than 30 years ago lending small sums of money to poor entrepreneurs in Bangladesh. Since then, microfinance programs have become major sources of lending in developing countries. Many of the organizations offering microloans are for-profit companies.
In the U.S., microfinance programs have also been around for decades, but haven't reached the size and scope of programs abroad. According to the Aspen Institute, the industry lent out $68 million in 2008, a tiny fraction of the U.S. credit market.
Still, about 20 groups in New York alone are trying to tap the growing market. Accion USA, the biggest microfinance organization in the country, has been lending in New York since 1991. It says loan applications increased by 20% at Accion USA over the past two years as the recession caused widespread damage to New York's small business sector.
"In 2007, we saw a pretty big warning flag," said Gina Harman, president and chief executive of Accion USA. She says small businesses that couldn't get traditional loans flocked to Accion, but many weren't in a position to borrow.
Project Enterprise, a microlender based in Harlem, also saw a 20% increase in applications over the past two years, said Catherine Barnett, vice president of programs at the organization. Project Enterprise, which also has service locations in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn, will open new service locations in Staten Island this month. The average size of a loan is $2,200.
Despite the jump in demand, the amount of loans it was able to dole out was about the same as prerecession levels. "We just didn't have enough to keep up with the demand," Ms. Barnett said.
Grameen America, which started in Jackson Heights in 2008, recently opened branches in Brooklyn last fall and in Manhattan in May to meet increased demand. Grameen is also working with St. John's University to develop a "Bank for America" program similar to Teach for America. It will recruit recent college graduates to provide banking services in low-income communities throughout the U.S.
The most pressing issue facing the group is funding, said Stephen Vogel, chief executive of Grameen America. "Demand is exceeding our level to lend."
Funding is a big challenge for all U.S. microlenders and also one of the key reasons why the industry hasn't matched the scale of their counterparts oversees. Most U.S. microlenders rely on donations from banks, foundations and private donors to operate.
"The fund-raising climate has been a tough one for nonprofits," said Ms. Barnett of Project Enterprise.
Other challenges include the high cost of doing business. The U.S. credit market is tightly regulated. Microlending in the U.S. is also more labor intensive and requires more one-on-one relationships with borrowers, said Ms. Harman from Accion.
While U.S. microfinance organizations may never reach the scale of the counterparts abroad, they are making a difference, said Ms. Edgcomb.
"Not everyone succeeds," Ms. Edgcomb said. "What we have seen is indeed these programs do start businesses. We do see jobs."
Ms. Aspiazu, for example, says the loans have allowed her to increase her inventory of clothing and perfume that she sells at home.
"It helps me to keep working and keep my business growing," she said.

NORTH MIAMI, Fla.--Four years after the U.S. government accused Lyglenson Lemorin of plotting terrorist acts, and two and a half years after a jury found him not guilty, the 35-year-old Haitian remains in jail, with no idea how long he will be held.
Despite Mr. Lemorin's 2007 acquittal, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials still consider him a national-security risk, essentially because he knew the co-defendants in his own case. After Mr. Lemorin's trial, an immigration judge agreed, ruling that he had provided "material support" to terrorists by having worked at the construction business of a co-defendant who was convicted of conspiracy and imprisoned.
The government intended to send Mr. Lemorin (leh-moh-REEN) back to Haiti after his appeal was rejected in December. Immigration judges have wide discretion to remove people from the U.S., including permanent residents such as Mr. Lemorin. Grounds of "moral turpitude" can cover anything from committing minor crimes to--as in this case--associating with undesirable people.
But that plan was stymied by the January earthquake that devastated that country and led the U.S. government to offer Temporary Protected Status to Haitians here. About 225,000 people are currently eligible for that designation, temporarily preventing the government from relocating them to countries in distress from civil strife or natural disaster, regardless of their legal status. More than 50,000, including Mr. Lemorin, have applied.
Now Mr. Lemorin's lawyer Rhonda Gelfman has petitioned immigration authorities to release her client on the grounds that the only reason they are detaining him is to remove him--and that under TPS they couldn't.
"There are two conditions Mr. Lemorin qualifies under" for release, Ms. Gelfman said. "He's a Haitian, and he's never been convicted of a crime."
In what has become a common tactic in terrorism cases, immigration courts detain defendants acquitted on criminal charges, usually relying on the same evidence, legal experts say. Immigration courts treat these as civil cases in which "there is a lower burden of proof," said Charles Kuck, another lawyer representing Mr. Lemorin, in an appeal of the removal order to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Immigrants face what defense attorneys call "de facto double jeopardy" when they are detained after acquittal, Mr. Kuck said.
Another of Mr. Kuck's clients, an Egyptian-born university student named Youssef Megahed, was held for more than a year after a Tampa, Fla., jury acquitted him of possession of explosives in 2008. He ultimately was released and now is attempting to become a naturalized U.S. citizen.
In still another case, a Saudi man named Sami al-Hussayen was acquitted in 2004, in Idaho, of charges that a Muslim charity's website he worked on ran coded, pro-terrorism messages. He was held for 15 months before he accepted a plea bargain and returned to Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Kuck sees the earthquake playing a role apart from whether Mr. Lemorin qualifies for TPS. His argument: Haitian authorities have suspended the reception of returned immigrants since the crisis, forcing U.S. jails to hold deportees. He plans to argue that his client's long detention should end unless U.S. officials can demonstrate that Mr. Lemorin poses a security risk to the community.
Federal authorities declined to comment on Mr. Lemorin's case or his TPS application, citing privacy concerns. Nicole Navas, spokeswoman for the Miami office of ICE, would only confirm that Mr. Lemorin remains in the immigration agency's custody.
Mr. Lemorin, who emigrated to Florida with his mother as a boy and who holds a permanent-resident card, was one of seven men from Miami's Liberty City neighborhood charged in a July 2006 case brought against mainly Haitian and African-American suspects who had joined a community-renewal organization. Federal officials characterized the group as a terrorist movement that had pledged loyalty to al Qaeda after meeting with two men from Yemen and Lebanon.
At the time, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales called the arrests a breakthrough against home-grown conspiracies, in what came to be called the Liberty City Seven case. He asserted that the suspects had planned to destroy Chicago's Sears Tower and launch jihad inside the U.S.
But even the government conceded there was little clear evidence that an attack on the skyscraper was in the works, according to evidence presented at trial. Poorly educated and practically destitute, the defendants didn't seem to have the means to engage in jihad, or to train with weapons or explosives, court records show.
Defense attorneys argued that the principal acts of the alleged conspiracy--swearing a loyalty oath to al Qaeda and videotaping federal buildings in Miami as future targets--occurred at the behest of the two Arab witnesses, who later were identified in court as FBI informants.
Jurors accepted the defense that Mr. Lemorin had moved to Atlanta to distance himself from the group rather than to start an al Qaeda cell, as the government alleged.
Narseal Batiste, the group's leader, testified that although Mr. Lemorin did swear loyalty to al Qaeda, he did so only because he and his co-defendants thought they were scamming the two Arabs, who had promised to give $50,000 to Mr. Batiste's community program.
Jurors were unable to reach a verdict on the six defendants who remained after Mr. Lemorin's acquittal, and who were tried jointly, forcing a mistrial. In a 2008 retrial, jurors again failed to reach a verdict. About a year ago, jurors convicted five members of the group, including Mr. Batiste, Mr. Lemorin's former employer, who received prison sentences ranging from four to 13 years.
The sixth, a U.S. citizen named Naudimar Herrera, was, like Mr. Lemorin, acquitted. Mr. Herrera is the only member of the original seven defendants not in jail today. Mr. Lemorin continued to languish in jail.
As Mr. Lemorin's attorneys prepare their arguments, Mr. Kuck is skeptical of Ms. Gelfman's attempt to spring his client under TPS.
"I'm a big fan of Don Quixote," he said, "but this argument goes way beyond quixotic." Ms. Gelfman concedes that her strategy is a long shot.
Neither thinks the approach will hurt their client. Even if the TPS gambit fails, Mr. Kuck is convinced a district court will soon grant Mr. Lemorin conditional release, perhaps involving an electronic monitor on his ankle, on other grounds.
The reason is simple, he said: "They can't send him home because of the earthquake, and they can't hold him forever."

Europe's sovereign-debt crisis signals the end of an era. Wealthy Western countries may no longer be the safe havens they once were for international investors. By contrast, many emerging markets--particularly India and China--proved more resilient to the global recession, and are less heavily indebted. The new "stable" economies can be found in the developing world.
In global economic terms, this happened fast.
It is not hard to remember the panic of 1997, which was triggered by debt and uncertainty in Asia--and which then ignited a meltdown in Russia and Latin America. Leaders in those economies learned to avoid the bad habit of excessive debt and the straitjacket of the International Monetary Fund's austere financial requirements. One wonders if Europe's leaders will be forced to learn that same lesson.
Unless you've seen it first-hand, it's difficult to appreciate the magnitude of the transformation that's taking place right now in rapid-growth economies. As a global hotel company, we operate in nearly 100 different countries. So we're on the front lines of this change, and it's staggering to watch its speed. The economic center of mass is shifting at an unprecedented rate. For more than 40% of the world's population, the local economy is growing at an average of 8% per year.
Take India. Just 25 years ago, regions like Punjab were the site of blood turf wars, and were known for backbreaking poverty. I recently watched a Punjab team play cricket at a 75,000-seat stadium in Delhi. These cricket teams are worth hundreds of millions of dollars each. There are leagues, franchises, and huge, packed stadiums all over India.
India's economy grew 6.7% in 2009. And in case you forgot, that was the year of the global economic meltdown. Between 2004 and 2008, the country averaged an incredible 9% average annual growth rate.
Yet India's infrastructure--and the investors who will help build it--have a lot of catching up to do. India has over a billion people, yet only about 100,000 hotel rooms. To put that in perspective, New York City alone has 80,000 rooms.
How are we adapting? Starwood currently has 26 hotels in India, and looks to operate 50 by 2014. The market will still be vastly underserved.
China's growth is even more impressive. Its economy slowed only briefly during the downturn. In the first quarter of this year, the People's Republic posted an 11.9% growth rate. Not surprisingly, more than 80 of the 300 hotels we at Starwood plan on opening in the next three years will be in China. Although we're based in America, we have over 25,000 Chinese employees.
In previous global contractions, developed nations led the world's economic recovery. That's not the case this time around. America, Japan, and countries in the European Union are all posting anemic post-recession growth rates. Collectively, they are likely to grow less than 3% this year. Meanwhile, Moody's recently took the unprecedented step of warning that it might downgrade U.S. Treasury bonds. Spain and Greece have already suffered that indignity.
To be sure, the Western world will recover and stay affluent for years to come. But it won't necessarily be at the front of tomorrow's pack.
As a global hotel company, we are directly--and immediately--affected by this change. So we are responding. Right now, 75% of our planned hotel openings are outside the U.S., EU, and Japan.
Political leaders must respond, too.
About 30 years ago, Western economies, led by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, bit the bullet and stopped inflation. The same resolve needs to be shown in adapting to today's reality.
For starters, "wealthy" nations must get their fiscal houses in order and simplify tax codes. They need to reform immigration rules to ensure that the world's best and brightest can come to their countries to work, regardless of where they're born. And regulators and business leaders alike should take a second look at labor rules that constrain productivity and growth.
The power dynamics in the global economy have shifted profoundly and unalterably. Unless America and Europe fundamentally reform their policies, they risk being left behind by the rising economic powerhouses of the developing world--with the IMF calling the shots.

For the last four decades, generations of Uruguayans had to rely on the elders to hear the tales of improbable soccer victories that turned one of the smallest Latin American nations into a powerhouse in the world's most popular sport.
Now, those born after 1970 have their own epic on a global stage to treasure: Uruguay's soccer team is one game away from the World Cup final. My country of 3.5 million people knows to appreciate this feat. Our return to a place among the world's soccer royalty feels like a reflection of what the country has accomplished since independence in 1825.
The soccer gold medals at the 1924 and 1928 Olympics and the World Cup victories in 1930 and 1950 represent landmarks of a golden era for the country. Beyond the triumphs on the pitch against giant rivals such as Argentina and Brazil, Uruguay in the first half of the 20th century enjoyed a period of steady economic growth and development on par with many of the European nations its political class sought to emulate.
Uruguay earned the nickname the Switzerland of Latin America as a reflection of its stable, democratic and egalitarian society in a region known for unrest and underdevelopment.
By the 1920s Uruguay had passed a law allowing for divorce and another granting universal voting rights to all its citizens. Uruguay welcomed intellectuals and political refugees from the European conflicts, including the Spanish Civil War. The newcomers taught at local universities and founded publications, adding to an already vibrant cultural and political scene.
Immigrant waves also enriched its soccer culture. The first clubs were founded by English sailors and railroad workers, but all newcomers contributed. Italian, Spanish and African Uruguayans soon joined the ranks of the new clubs.
Unlike other countries in the region, Uruguay never segregated its leagues.
Uruguay's mostly agricultural economy boomed along with demand for commodities during the two World Wars. At one point in the late 1940s the Uruguayan peso traded on par with the U.S. dollar.
But by the end of the Korean War demand for Uruguay's main exports started to decline, straining governments that could no longer afford some of the most generous social programs in the region.
The country was entering one of its most turbulent periods in 1970, the last time Uruguay reached the World Cup semifinals. The result was a military junta dissolving the legislature in 1973.
Uruguayans often point to that year as the beginning of a decline as a society that extended to the football field.
Indeed, since 1974 Uruguay only qualified for three World Cups before this year.
The country has had better luck in other areas, returning to a full democratic rule in the mid-1980s and enjoying a steady rate of economic growth thanks of the boom in commodity prices of the last decade.
The passion unleashed by the team's unexpected run to the World Cup's final stages has inspired feelings in Uruguayans that sat dormant for 40 years.
People have flocked to the chilly winter streets after each recent victory. Uruguayan flags appear everywhere in the capital Montevideo and other smaller cities. Early signs point to increases in consumption and spending, and the few surviving members of the last successful teams of 1950 and the fourth-place squad in 1970 appear regularly in the press.
Uruguayan president Jose Mujica had dinner with the national squad on the eve of their departure to South Africa. The former guerrilla-turned-politician told the players, most of whom make a living in the European leagues, to play with joy, since "soccer is not war." The team has certainly followed their president's orders.
Uruguayans tend to abide to the notion that the way a national team plays can say a lot about a country's character. No one expects a return to the golden age, however. Most of us are just immensely grateful to a team that has brought back the country to the global stage.

Ballot crusade in Arizona; Activists hope more Latino votes can alter immigration policy. It worked in California.

Abstract: The canvassers were part of an ambitious push to increase turnout of Latino voters in the wake of a controversial state law that requires police to determine the immigration status of people they legally stop and suspect are in the country illegally. Activists hope that SB 1070, which Republican Gov.

Full text: Rafael Robles has been eligible to vote ever since he became a U.S. citizen 23 years ago, but nothing has spurred him to register until two young activists visited his house here last week.
The canvassers were part of an ambitious push to increase turnout of Latino voters in the wake of a controversial state law that requires police to determine the immigration status of people they legally stop and suspect are in the country illegally.
Robles, 60, recounted how his 39-year-old daughter, a Phoenix native, has been stopped multiple times by officers who ask her in broken Spanish where she was born.
"It's only because she is Hispanic," Robles said as he filled out a form to become a voter. He noted how, in decades past, signs were posted at establishments across the Southwest saying no dogs or Mexicans were allowed.
"It can all return," he said.
Activists hope that SB 1070, which Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law in April and is scheduled to take effect July 29, will generate enough angry new Latino voters like Robles to reshape this state's hard-line approach to immigration.
As they fan out across sun-bleached barrios this summer, the activists cite the example of California.
More than 1 million California Latinos became citizens after the passage of anti-illegal immigrant Proposition 187 in 1994, putting the state solidly in the hands of Democrats and pushing immigration crackdowns to the margins.
Many analysts and political scientists predict a similar outcome -- eventually -- in Arizona. Latinos, 30% of the population, are the fastest-growing and youngest demographic group in the state.
"It's the same energy I saw with 187," said Ben Monterroso, a Service Employees International Union official who spearheaded voter registration in California in 1994 and now oversees the Arizona operation. "People are saying enough is enough."
But Arizona may be much more difficult to change, partly because Latinos are a smaller piece of the electorate in the state than in California, said Harry Pachon of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute at USC.
And Stan Barnes, a lobbyist and former Republican legislator in the Arizona Senate, said the state's crackdown on illegal immigrants would bring out other new voters -- ones who support sealing the border.
"The average guy in Arizona believes that Mexico has become a narco state and that is coming to Arizona," Barnes said. "The fact that the Arizona government has rallied to confront that has energized a whole new electorate."
It's obvious which way the political wind is blowing in the state that has become the favorite illegal entry point from Mexico. Few candidates for statewide office here, even Democrats who opposed SB 1070, are openly sympathetic to illegal immigrants.
New hard-line measures pop up seemingly every day. Last week, a Republican candidate for the state Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities, proposed shutting off power to homes of illegal immigrants.
Polls show that SB 1070 is popular in Arizona, except among Latinos; in the most lopsided survey, as much as 81% opposed it. The get-out-the-vote campaign, launched in June by a coalition of labor, community and religious groups, is trying to channel that outrage in November.
The canvassers target Latinos who are already registered but rarely vote. Latino voter turnout hovers about 35%, and about 60% of all Arizona voters went to the polls in the last off-year election. Sixteen percent of registered voters in the state are Latino.
Francisco Heredia, the state director of Mi Familia Vota, the nonprofit spearheading the campaign, said the decision to focus on turnout was forced partly by Arizona law requiring people to prove their citizenship status before registering to vote. That makes it cumbersome for canvassers to sign up people who don't have documents handy or are wary about sharing them with strangers.
At 1:45 p.m. on Wednesday, about two dozen canvassers filled a conference room in SEIU headquarters in Phoenix, chatting with a smaller group in Tucson via video. The walls were lined with papers listing how many voters other groups in the campaign had reached.
The campaign is trying to vastly increase the number of Latinos who sign up to receive mail-in ballots, which will make it easier for them to vote. The field coordinator, Martin Manteca, totaled the numbers and announced that they were at 2,300.
In pairs, the canvassers, all younger than 30, filed out and were driven to precincts around town. Yvette Saenz, 17, and Israel Araujo, 23, walked a blue-collar stretch of south Phoenix known as Sunland.
It was an appropriate name on this day, as the mercury climbed to 110 degrees. Before approaching doors, they rattled fences to make sure they weren't surprised by guard dogs.
"Anyone eligible to vote here?" Araujo asked a white-haired man who answered the door at one of the first houses.
"No, I'm from Mexico. I don't got no papers," the man said in English.
"Don't tell Arpaio," he quipped, referring to Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, notorious in the community for arresting suspected illegal immigrants.
For every successful contact, there were dozens of unanswered knocks, or voices behind opaque screen doors telling the canvassers to leave.
After Araujo registered Rafael Robles to vote, there was a distinct spring in the canvasser's step.
"That keeps me going," said Araujo, who recently graduated from community college and plans to keep canvassing until he enrolls at Arizona State University to pursue an electrical engineering degree.
By the time Araujo and Saenz were done almost six hours later, they had persuaded 20 voters to sign up for mail-in ballots and had registered nine new voters.

Full text: Unless it is halted by a judge, Arizona's new immigration law is set to take effect July 29.
Civil rights groups have filed suit against the law, arguing that immigration is the purview of the federal government and that SB 1070 will promote racial profiling.
--
What does the law do?
The law essentially mandates that local governments in Arizona enforce immigration laws. The provision that has received the most attention is the creation of a new state crime: failure to possess proper immigration documents.
SB 1070 also forbids local entities, such as city councils or police departments, from making it a policy to ignore federal immigration laws. It allows people to sue if such a policy is formulated.
However, it may take months or years to learn the effects of the law because judges will probably rule on how it can be implemented.
--
What are police required to do under the law?
If officers stop, detain or arrest people while enforcing other laws or ordinances and reasonably suspect they are in the country illegally, they have to try to determine their status if it's practicable.
In other words, police don't have to determine someone's legal status if there's a shootout going on. They also get a pass if inquiring would hinder an investigation -- by scaring off witnesses, for example.
--
If police find that the people they've stopped are illegal immigrants, do the police have to arrest them?
No. The law is silent on what police must do once they determine someone is in the country illegally.
--
What else must police do under the law?
Anyone arrested in Arizona cannot be released until police check with the federal government to determine whether that person is in the country legally.
Some read this to mean that it doesn't matter if suspects have birth certificates and passports -- the federal government must confirm their status before they are freed. Others contend that the requirement only applies to suspected illegal immigrants.
Also, authorities must alert the federal government when any illegal immigrant convicted of a crime of any severity is released from custody or pays a fine to resolve a case.
--
Are police required to turn convicted illegal immigrants over to the federal government?
No, just to notify federal immigration agents.
--
How does this change things?
Currently, all law enforcement officers in the country, unless forbidden by management, are allowed to check on the immigration status of people they stop or arrest. This makes checking a requirement.
Police departments generally notify federal immigration officials when violent criminals who are illegal immigrants are being released from jail. SB 1070 makes it mandatory, and applies to low-grade offenders as well as violent felons.
--
Is this the same as federal law?
No. Although many of the crimes in SB 1070 are modeled on existing federal crimes, federal law does not require local police officers to check immigration status. There's also no right under federal law for people to sue local agencies that have policies against enforcing immigration laws.
--
Does SB 1070 require people who are legally in Arizona to carry "papers"?
No. The law specifies that certain documents can be shown to police to demonstrate someone is in the country legally -- an Arizona driver's license or state ID card, tribal membership card or any other U.S. government ID that is only issued to legal residents. (Several states, including New Mexico, give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, so those licenses wouldn't suffice.) There's no requirement that people carry these documents, however.
The question of papers arises from the most prominent of the new crimes in SB 1070, called willful failure to complete or carry an alien registration document. It's a misdemeanor modeled on a rarely enforced 1940 federal statute. But SB 1070 says that anyone in the country legally cannot be convicted of this crime.
Paradoxically, therefore, legal residents are not required to carry their documents.
From a practical perspective, however, some people may wish to carry proof of legal residency or citizenship if they believe they will be questioned by authorities about their status. And the federal statute that SB 1070 borrows from does require legal immigrants to carry their paperwork.
--
Is racial profiling allowed under this law?
The law bars consideration of race "except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution." Courts have allowed police to consider race if, for example, they have a report of a suspect of a certain race fleeing from a crime.
Border Patrol agents have been given slightly more leeway in specific immigration investigations to consider race; it's unclear whether courts would extend those abilities to Arizona police.
Critics contend that there's no way to enforce the law without racial profiling. The law's authors disagree.
--
What are the other new crimes under this law?
The law makes it a misdemeanor for illegal immigrants to work in Arizona and also outlaws the solicitation of work or any hiring that impedes traffic, a provision aimed at day laborers and those who employ them.
The law also makes it a misdemeanor to transport, harbor or shield an undocumented immigrant "in furtherance of their illegal presence," or encourage one to come to Arizona. But to be guilty of this misdemeanor, someone must be committing another criminal offense at the same time.
This last misdemeanor mirrors a federal law that is the subject of much judicial debate. Courts have ruled it is illegal to help an undocumented immigrant move through the United States but does not bar such acts as driving them to school or the hospital.
Some worry that courts could interpret the state law to mean that anyone transporting illegal immigrants anywhere could be guilty of this crime. The authors say it's clear SB 1070 applies only in the same situations as the federal law, such as helping an undocumented immigrant sneak into the country.

Full text: Does Rand Paul really want to build an underground electronic fence on the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration? His campaign says no.
The Kentucky candidate for the U.S. Senate raised quite a few eyebrows in Republican circles recently when the news broke that his campaign Web site listed a plan for "an underground electric fence, with helicopter stations to respond quickly to breaches of the border."
Even John Cornyn, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was baffled, wondering aloud to the Huffington Post: "How would that work?"
But Paul spokesman Jesse Benton has clarified that the Web site is wrong -- the fence Paul envisions, while electronic, is not meant to be underground. "That's a stupid word that was put in by whoever is writing for our Web site and we need to remove it," Benton said.
Benton said that Paul does think an electronic fence "should be explored" and that Paul envisions it having a "combination of thermal imaging, satellite technology, motion detection and helicopters at key checkpoints."
But it wouldn't be underground. "Perhaps some of the thermal stuff might be buried, but that's it," Benton said. The electronic fence idea isn't new; it has been tried in other countries, but various proposals floated have been non-starters.
Benton added that Paul isn't necessarily wedded to the fence being electronic. "Rand's priority is to secure the border by all appropriate means," he said. "He supports any kind of fence, whether it's physical or electronic."
So no need to worry about any underground fences. It's not on Rand Paul's to-do list.

Full text: Five years ago, a group of Indian Americans who worked as staffers on Capitol Hill started up a club. They called themselves the "Desi Power Hour," and met to share their experiences and help each other get a leg up in Washington. Small in number and short on experience, they may have been Desis -- children or grandchildren of immigrants from India -- but they had little power.
Today, though, that once-casual gathering of legislative aides, communications consultants, tech gurus and fundraisers has grown into an influential political network that undergirds the record number of Indian Americans running for political office this year.
Gautam Raghavan, for instance, is deputy White House liaison at the Department of Defense and has helped build a network of young Indian American political donors. Toby Chaudhuri, former director of communications at the Campaign for America's Future, is a political strategist who helps candidates craft their messages. Anil Mammen is a direct-mail consultant and the go-to guy for those in the community who aspire to political office.
In addition to Nikki Haley, the barrier-breaking Republican nominee for governor of South Carolina, Indian Americans are campaigning this year for congressional seats in Pennsylvania, Kansas, California, New York and Ohio. More than a dozen serve in senior positions in the Obama administration, including U.S. Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra and USAID chief Rajiv Shah. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the first Indian American governor, made the Republican short list for vice president in 2008.
"We used to be accused of being those that wrote checks and had photo ops, but never actually did anything in policy," said Shekar Narasimhan, co-chair of the Democratic Party's Indo-American Leadership council. "It is now very legitimized for people to run for office in our community. Five years ago, it wasn't."
That legitimacy came from winning elections, as Jindal did in 2007, and through the tangential success of political operatives, said Parag Mehta, who attended many Desi Hour lunches and later worked as the Democratic Party's director of internal communications.
"We've built the bench up," Mehta said. "We are in senior positions and can help each other. There's a camaraderie."
Like Haley, most of the politicians in races this year are second-generation immigrants who volunteered for local political campaigns, served in state legislatures or worked on Capitol Hill.
Manan Trivedi, a doctor and Iraq war veteran, recently won the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania's 6th Congressional District. Before running for Congress, he served as a health-care adviser to the Obama campaign.
Raj Goyle, who has served in the Kansas legislature for three years, is running in the Democratic primary in the 4th Congressional District, which includes his home town of Wichita. Reshma Saujani, a Democratic fundraiser in the South Asian community, says she is the first Indian American woman to run for Congress.
"I always wanted to serve, but I never thought someone with my name could actually run," said Saujani, who is challenging Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) in the Sept. 14 primary.
The increased political involvement is an indication of "successful assimilation into mainstream American society," said Dino Teppara, chair of the Indian American Conservative Council and former chief of staff for Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.).
The nation's 2.5 million Indian Americans rank among the most highly educated ethnic groups in the United States, according to Census figures, and they have the highest per-capita income.
Although the community leans Democratic, according to a 2009 survey by the Asian American Legal Defense Fund, its wealth has attracted aspiring candidates of both parties.
Individual donors connected to Teppara's council have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Indian American conservatives and other Republicans, he said. Democratic candidates get financial support through the decade-old Indian American Leadership Initiative. That group has endorsed both congressional and local candidates this year, and late last year it formed a political action committee, which has raised $100,000.
The money "obviously" makes a big difference, said Sanjay Puri, chairman of the nonpartisan US India Political Action Committee, which raised $75,000 in the first quarter of the year and $300,000 in 2008 to support Indian American candidates and others who have pro-India views. "The money is there. The candidates just have to prove that they are credible."
Still, Indian American candidates remain sensitive to being viewed as outsiders. Questions arose about Jindal's and Haley's religious beliefs; Jay Goyal (D), now the 29-year-old majority whip of the Ohio legislature, emphasized in his first political campaign four years ago his family's decades of work in their central Ohio town. Similarly, Trivedi and Goyle emphasize on their Web sites deep roots in their respective communities.
The clear signs of political progress impress the man known as the dean of Indian American politics: Kumar P. Barve, majority leader in the Maryland House of Delegates. When he ran for office in 1990, few in the Indian American community would contribute money or time to his campaign. "Most believed it was really idiotic," he said.
Although Barve worries that many of the Indian American candidates will probably lose this year, he sees their efforts as an investment in the future. "Regardless of the outcome," he said, "you have to see this as a big victory for the Indian American, which is becoming a part of the political landscape."

Full text: The Justice Department has decided to file suit against Arizona on the grounds that the state's new immigration law illegally intrudes on federal prerogatives, law enforcement sources said Monday.
The lawsuit, which three sources said could be filed as early as Tuesday, will invoke for its main argument the legal doctrine of "preemption," which is based on the Constitution's supremacy clause and says that federal law trumps state statutes. Justice Department officials believe that enforcing immigration laws is a federal responsibility, the sources said.
A federal lawsuit will dramatically escalate the legal and political battle over the Arizona law, which gives police the power to question anyone if they have a "reasonable suspicion" that the person is an illegal immigrant. The measure has drawn words of condemnation from President Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and opposition from civil rights groups. It also has prompted at least five other lawsuits. Arizona officials have urged the Obama administration not to sue.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton first revealed last month that the Justice Department intended to sue Arizona, and department lawyers have been preparing their case, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the government has not announced its plans. The filing is expected to include declarations from other U.S. agencies saying that the Arizona law would place a undue burden on their ability to enforce immigration laws nationwide, because Arizona police are expected to refer so many illegal immigrants to federal authorities.
The preemption doctrine has been established in Supreme Court decisions, and some legal experts have said such a federal argument likely would persuade a judge to declare the law unconstitutional.
But lawyers who helped draft the Arizona legislation have expressed doubt that a preemption argument would prevail. The law, signed by Gov. Jan Brewer (R) in April, is scheduled to take effect later this month.

Full text: Tight credit markets have slammed small businesses during the recession. That leaves entrepreneurs like Cecilia Aspiazu, who sells clothing and beauty products out of her home in Jamaica, Queens, increasingly turning to microloans.
"I'm fixing it little by little," Ms. Aspiazu says of her shaky credit. "I would like to get a bank loan one day. I want to open a store."
In the meantime, Ms. Aspiazu, a 63-year-old from Colombia, is borrowing little amounts at a time. She is about to pay off her second loan for $2,000 from Grameen America, a microfinance organization that provides small loans mostly to immigrant women. Ms. Aspiazu plans to take out a third loan this August for $2,500.
Microfinance organizations such as Grameen America are expanding services in New York, amid growing demand. Applications for loans in 2009 were up at 66% of the U.S. microfinance organizations surveyed by the Aspen Institute, a policy and research organization.
Critics, however, say that the industry still faces challenges and may never achieve wide-scale success in the U.S.
"The big difference is that it is a lot harder to be a smaller scale entrepreneur" in the U.S. than overseas, said Jonathan Morduch, professor of public policy and economics at New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.
Interest rates also vary widely. Most U.S. nonprofit microfinance organizations offer loans with interest rates between 8% and 14%. International organizations often charge between 30% and 60%, said Elaine Edgcomb, director of the Aspen Institute's microenterprise Fund for Innovation, Effectiveness, Learning and Dissemination.
The Grameen franchise was one of the founders of the microfinance movement. It started more than 30 years ago lending small sums of money to poor entrepreneurs in Bangladesh. Since then, microfinance programs have become major sources of lending in developing countries. Many of the organizations offering microloans are for-profit companies.
In the U.S., microfinance programs have also been around for decades, but haven't reached the size and scope of programs abroad. According to the Aspen Institute, the industry lent out $68 million in 2008, a tiny fraction of the U.S. credit market.
Still, about 20 groups in New York alone are trying to tap the growing market. Accion USA, the biggest microfinance organization in the country, has been lending in New York since 1991. It says loan applications increased by 20% at Accion USA over the past two years as the recession caused widespread damage to New York's small business sector.
"In 2007, we saw a pretty big warning flag," said Gina Harman, president and chief executive of Accion USA. She says small businesses that couldn't get traditional loans flocked to Accion, but many weren't in a position to borrow.
Project Enterprise, a microlender based in Harlem, also saw a 20% increase in applications over the past two years, said Catherine Barnett, vice president of programs at the organization. Project Enterprise, which also has service locations in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn, will open new service locations in Staten Island this month. The average size of a loan is $2,200.
Despite the jump in demand, the amount of loans it was able to dole out was about the same as prerecession levels. "We just didn't have enough to keep up with the demand," Ms. Barnett said.
Grameen America, which started in Jackson Heights in 2008, recently opened branches in Brooklyn last fall and in Manhattan in May to meet increased demand. Grameen is also working with St. John's University to develop a "Bank for America" program similar to Teach for America. It will recruit recent college graduates to provide banking services in low-income communities throughout the U.S.
The most pressing issue facing the group is funding, said Stephen Vogel, chief executive of Grameen America. "Demand is exceeding our level to lend."
Funding is a big challenge for all U.S. microlenders and also one of the key reasons why the industry hasn't matched the scale of their counterparts oversees. Most U.S. microlenders rely on donations from banks, foundations and private donors to operate.
"The fund-raising climate has been a tough one for nonprofits," said Ms. Barnett of Project Enterprise.
Other challenges include the high cost of doing business. The U.S. credit market is tightly regulated. Microlending in the U.S. is also more labor intensive and requires more one-on-one relationships with borrowers, said Ms. Harman from Accion.
While U.S. microfinance organizations may never reach the scale of the counterparts abroad, they are making a difference, said Ms. Edgcomb.
"Not everyone succeeds," Ms. Edgcomb said. "What we have seen is indeed these programs do start businesses. We do see jobs."
Ms. Aspiazu, for example, says the loans have allowed her to increase her inventory of clothing and perfume that she sells at home.
"It helps me to keep working and keep my business growing," she said.

Full text: KOPLEWICZ--Joseph, 94, beloved husband of Roma, who passed in 2004, dearest companion of Janet Whitehill, loving father to Edith and Harold, adoring father in law to Linda Sirow, proud grandfather to Joshua, Adam, Sam, and Alex, and beloved uncle, grand uncle and great grand uncle died July 4, 2010. His extraordinary strength, courage, and resilience saw him through the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and 14 concentration camps, and his unwavering spirit and intelligence guided him when, in May of 1949, he immigrated to the United States penniless with his beloved Roma to begin their life again. Joe truly embodied the American dream. With energy and joy he built a business, raised a family, helped those in need and touched the hearts of all who knew him. His death on July 4th is fitting as he was proud and loved being an American citizen. His sparkle will forever remain with his family and friends. Services will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, Wednesday, July 7, at 9:30am. In lieu of flowers, please make contributions to the Roma and Joseph Koplewicz Fund at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, 100 Raoul Wallenberg Place, S.W., Washington, DC 2004-2126.

Full text: NORTH MIAMI, Fla. -- Four years after the U.S. government accused Lyglenson Lemorin of plotting terrorist acts, and two and a half years after a jury found him not guilty, the 35-year-old Haitian remains in jail, with no idea how long he will be held.
Despite Mr. Lemorin's 2007 acquittal, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials still consider him a national-security risk, essentially because he knew the co-defendants in his own case. After Mr. Lemorin's trial, an immigration judge agreed, ruling that he had provided "material support" to terrorists by having worked at the construction business of a co-defendant who was convicted of conspiracy and imprisoned.
The government intended to send Mr. Lemorin (leh-moh-REEN) back to Haiti after his appeal was rejected in December. Immigration judges have wide discretion to remove people from the U.S., including permanent residents such as Mr. Lemorin. Grounds of "moral turpitude" can cover anything from committing minor crimes to -- as in this case -- associating with undesirable people.
But that plan was stymied by the January earthquake that devastated that country and led the U.S. government to offer Temporary Protected Status to Haitians here. About 225,000 people are currently eligible for that designation, temporarily preventing the government from relocating them to countries in distress from civil strife or natural disaster, regardless of their legal status. More than 50,000, including Mr. Lemorin, have applied.
Now Mr. Lemorin's lawyer Rhonda Gelfman has petitioned immigration authorities to release her client on the grounds that the only reason they are detaining him is to remove him -- and that under TPS they couldn't.
"There are two conditions Mr. Lemorin qualifies under" for release, Ms. Gelfman said. "He's a Haitian, and he's never been convicted of a crime."
In what has become a common tactic in terrorism cases, immigration courts detain defendants acquitted on criminal charges, usually relying on the same evidence, legal experts say. Immigration courts treat these as civil cases in which "there is a lower burden of proof," said Charles Kuck, another lawyer representing Mr. Lemorin, in an appeal of the removal order to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Another of Mr. Kuck's clients, an Egyptian-born university student named Youssef Megahed, was held for more than a year after a Tampa, Fla., jury acquitted him of possession of explosives in 2008. He ultimately was released and now is attempting to become a U.S. citizen.
In still another case, a Saudi man named Sami al-Hussayen was acquitted in 2004, in Idaho, of charges that a Muslim charity's website he worked on ran coded, pro-terrorism messages. He was held for 15 months before he accepted a plea bargain and returned to Saudi Arabia.
Federal authorities declined to comment on Mr. Lemorin's case or his TPS application, citing privacy concerns. Nicole Navas, spokeswoman for the Miami office of ICE, would only confirm that Mr. Lemorin remains in the immigration agency's custody.
Mr. Lemorin was one of seven men from Miami's Liberty City neighborhood charged in a July 2006 case brought against mainly Haitian and African-American suspects who had joined a community-renewal organization. Federal officials characterized the group as a terrorist movement that had pledged loyalty to al Qaeda after meeting with two men from Yemen and Lebanon.
At the time, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asserted that the suspects had planned to destroy Chicago's Sears Tower and launch jihad inside the U.S.
But even the government conceded there was little clear evidence that an attack on the skyscraper was in the works, according to evidence presented at trial.
Defense attorneys argued that the principal acts of the alleged conspiracy -- swearing a loyalty oath to al Qaeda and videotaping federal buildings in Miami as future targets -- occurred at the behest of the two Arab witnesses, who later were identified in court as FBI informants.
Jurors accepted the defense that Mr. Lemorin had moved to Atlanta to distance himself from the group rather than to start an al Qaeda cell, as the government alleged.
Narseal Batiste, the group's leader, testified that although Mr. Lemorin did swear loyalty to al Qaeda, he did so only because he and his co-defendants thought they were scamming the two Arabs, who had promised to give $50,000 to Mr. Batiste's community program.
About a year ago, jurors convicted five members of the group, including Mr. Batiste, Mr. Lemorin's former employer, who received prison sentences ranging from four to 13 years.
The sixth was acquitted.
Even if the TPS gambit fails, Mr. Kuck is convinced a district court will soon grant Mr. Lemorin conditional release, perhaps involving an electronic monitor on his ankle, on other grounds.
The reason is simple, he said: "They can't send him home because of the earthquake, and they can't hold him forever."

Full text: They were among the last words he will perhaps ever utter in this country. Expressed, said his lawyer, without irony or bitterness. "God bless America."
With those few syllables, Ahmad Wais Afzali, dressed in a flowing white robe with black and beige trim, entered the security line at Kennedy International Airport with his wife, Fatima, on Monday morning. In their hands: one-way tickets out of the country where they had grown up and made a life.
Tailed by two casually dressed agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Mr. Afzali and his wife boarded a 2 p.m. flight for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
For Mr. Afzali, they were his final footsteps in the United States, if the authorities have their way.Mr. Afzali, an imam and Afghan immigrant who grew up in Queens, was ordered to leave the country after he warned Najibullah Zazi, the admitted mastermind in a plot to set off bombs in the New York subway, that he was under government surveillance. Mr. Afzali pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about the conversation.
Authorities described the plot as the most significant threat to national security since 9/11. But Mr. Afzali was never among the plotters. He became entangled in the plot when investigators with the New York City Police Department, which Mr. Afzali had helped occasionally as an informant since 9/11, contacted him seeking information about the three suspects.
Without explaining their interest in the men, the investigators asked him to find out more about what they were doing in New York. Not realizing the gravity of the case, he would later tell a judge, he told Mr. Zazi that the authorities were interested in him, while also urging him to stay out of trouble.
He later told a judge he was afraid when Federal Bureau of Investigation agents interrogated him two days later, so he lied about the conversation with Mr. Zazi.
At his sentencing in April, even prosecutors conceded that Mr. Afzali was "almost certainly" unaware of the seriousness of his actions. A federal judge spared him jail time but ordered him to leave the country within 90 days or be deported. He had until July 14 to comply, his lawyer, Ronald L. Kuby, said.
On Monday morning, Mr. Kuby and an associate arrived at Mr. Afzali's home in Queens. About a dozen family members had gathered to say goodbye. With the court's permission, Mr. Kuby snipped the electronic monitor from Mr. Afzali's ankle, which he had worn since his arrest in September.
"It was the first of a number of emotional moments for him," Mr. Kuby said, "because it was a tremendous sense of liberation, not so much physically, he said, but spiritually."
After considering many places they might move to, and worrying about which places might be safe, Mr. Afzali and his wife decided on Saudi Arabia, where she has a teaching job waiting for her. Mr. Afzali doesn't know what he'll do yet, Mr. Kuby said. "They're a family of entrepreneurs," he said. "Maybe he'll open an Afghan restaurant in Riyadh." His two pre-teenage children will stay in Virginia with his first wife but plan to visit often, Mr. Kuby said.
Mr. Afzali's younger brother drove him to the airport, followed by the ICE agents in a second car and Mr. Kuby and his associate in a third vehicle. Mr. Afzali's wife followed in a fourth vehicle with her family members and piles of luggage, a mini-caravan leading to the end of Mr. Afzali's American journey.

Full text: 'I'm ready to move forward," said President Obama toward the end of his speech last week calling for immigration reform. But "without bipartisan support," he added, "we cannot solve this problem." Mr. Obama blames GOP restrictionists for the lack of progress, but from our longtime pro-reform vantage point his own divisive approach to immigration is equally at fault.
A case study is yesterday's Justice Department lawsuit against the state of Arizona over its new immigration law requiring local police to enforce federal immigration statutes. The suit suggests that, notwithstanding his repeated "Si se puede" pledges on reform to Latino voters, Mr. Obama is more focused on branding the GOP anti-immigrant than he is on signing a reform bill.
The Arizona law is above all else a cry for federal help, and Mr. Obama could have used the law to re-launch a constructive debate on the urgency of reform and the consequences of further delay. Instead, since the law passed in April, the Administration has gone out of its way to pander to liberal activists and other critics of the measure and inflame the already emotional issue.
Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano publicly trashed the legislation by their own admission before they had even read it. Then the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said his agency won't necessarily deport illegals referred by Arizona police under the new law. One of the biggest obstacles to passing reform that combines enforcement with more legal immigration has been convincing a skeptical public that any immigration policy will be enforced.
Now comes the federal lawsuit, which is designed to block the law before it takes effect this month. The suit charges the state with pre-empting federal law in violation of the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, and unlike the case of health care the Constitution does expressly give Congress the power to "establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization." Justice also claims Arizona goes further than federal immigration law by making it a crime for anyone here illegally to solicit work.
The feds may well win their case on the Constitutional merits, and we also oppose the Arizona law on grounds that it is a misuse of scarce police resources. One of its provisions criminalizes anyone who stops to pick up an illegal migrant worker even to do yard work. Arizona police have enough to worry about without making criminals of suburbanites who want help in landscaping their cactus gardens.
On the other hand, the alarmists are wrong to portray the law as creating a new race-based police state. Nearly all of the law mirrors federal immigration statutes and orders local police to enforce those statutes for the first time. Notably, the feds aren't suing Arizona on equal protection grounds, despite Mr. Obama's repeated public and polarizing claims that the law could lead to racial profiling. This, too, betrays the political cynicism behind his public denunciations.
The larger reality is that neither Arizona's law nor the 1,200 National Guard troops recently deployed to the border will stop Mexican migrants from crossing the border to make a better life. In the past two decades, the U.S. Border Patrol's budget has seen a nine-fold increase, and the number of border patrol agents has grown by a factor of five. Yet over that same period the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. has tripled.
Illegal migrants will continue to arrive as long as the demand for entry visas outstrips the supply. To reduce pressure on border communities, politicians would do better to focus on devising guest worker programs and other visa proposals that would allow economic migrants to work here legally. This would reduce human smuggling, document fraud, trespassing and other criminality common in border regions. It would also free limited homeland security resources to focus on gang members, drug dealers and other serious threats.
The Arizona law has polled well nationally, and the unfortunate truth is that elements in both political parties have sought to exploit it. On the right, GOP restrictionists have used it to promote a populist backlash against any immigration reform. They claim we can't have reform until we "secure the borders," but the reality is we can't secure the borders without reform that allows more legal ways to work in America.
Some conservatives also hope to use the issue to further drive voter turnout this fall, as if Republican voters aren't fired up already. And as if there won't be a longer-term electoral cost to a GOP that reinforces liberal stereotypes that it is an Anglo-only party.
As for Democrats, Mr. Obama clearly wants to use the Arizona law to mobilize Latinos against the GOP this year and looking ahead to 2012. Having promised as a candidate to address immigration in his first year as President, Mr. Obama waited until four months before the midterm elections to give his first major immigration speech.
His speech last week praised President Bush for his 2007 attempt at reform, but only as a way of criticizing the GOP for killing it. The truth is that the 2007 failure was bipartisan, as we well know from having been caught in the crossfire. Majority Harry Reid blocked any serious consideration in the Senate.
Mr. Obama's partisan immigration tactics might assuage his own party activists, but in the process he is further alienating Republicans and poisoning the chances for genuine reform through the rest of his Presidency.

(Please see Corrections and Amplifications .)
WASHINGTON--The Obama administration set up a legal battle over states' rights and heightened the political stakes on immigration for both parties by filing a suit to block Arizona's tough new immigration law.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by the Justice Department, sets up a likely Supreme Court clash over state versus federal power that some supporters of the measure hope establishes a new legal precedent. Usually, state and local governments steer clear of areas that are considered the jurisdiction of federal authorities under established law. Supporters of Arizona's immigration measure say they were helping to enforce federal law, not supplant it.
The suit comes as immigration is emerging again as a prominent political issue, particularly in states with large Hispanic populations. In several Republican primaries, candidates have backed the Arizona law as they seek to prove to conservative voters that they are the most committed to halting illegal immigration. Many Latino voters are similarly energized in opposition to the law, which many deem to be discriminatory.
The law, which is set to take effect July 29, makes illegal immigration a state crime and requires police to verify the immigration status of people stopped for other alleged crimes. State lawmakers said they were acting because the federal government has failed to protect the state's border with Mexico from encroachment by illegal immigrants.
The suit, filed in Phoenix, said that the state had "crossed a constitutional line" that interferes with the federal authority over immigration. It alleges that the state law would burden federal agencies, diverting resources from such higher priorities as tracking illegal immigrants implicated in terrorism cases, drug smuggling or other crimes.
"Setting immigration policy and enforcing immigration laws is a national responsibility," Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. "Seeking to address the issue through a patchwork of state laws will only create more problems than it solves."
Precedent suggests the Obama administration has the upper hand in the suit. Federal courts, dating back to laws in the 1880s aimed at limiting Chinese immigration, have given the federal government wide latitude to regulate such matters. But in recent decades, courts have also allowed state laws that rely on federal law, such as those denying state benefits to illegal immigrants.
More broadly, federal courts have sided with the federal government in cases of states and cities passing laws that conflict with federal law.
"I think the federal government is going to win and the Arizona law is going to be shown to be unconstitutional," said Karl M. Manheim, professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "States don't have any power to regulate immigration."
Supporters of the law say it is needed to discourage people from crossing into and remaining in the state illegally. Its passage came after years of frustration with the porous southern border, kidnappings and murder.
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer called the federal lawsuit "a massive waste of taxpayer funds" and said the money "could be better used against the violent Mexican cartels than the people of Arizona."
She said that the Obama administration, if worried about a patchwork of laws, could have chosen to sue local governments that adopted "sanctuary'' policies instructing police not to cooperate with federal immigration officials.
The lawsuit comes as President Barack Obama and his party are trying to energize a Democratic base that is far less enthusiastic about voting this November than are core Republican voters. At the same time, Democrats have been stymied in trying to move an overhaul of immigration laws through Congress, which strategists say has depressed enthusiasm among Hispanic voters.
The White House declined to say if Mr. Obama planned to travel to Arizona, though he will be in neighboring Nevada this week. A top White House official, homeland security adviser John Brennan, was in Arizona last week discussing border enforcement plans.
White House officials say political considerations did not play a part in the decision to file the lawsuit. Still, Democrats hope that challenging the Arizona law will further solidify the party's reputation for advocating for the Hispanic community.
Some analysts said Tuesday that the Democrats face a tricky balance, given a potential backlash from white, middle-class voters who support the Arizona effort by wide margins in some polls.
In a June Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, 45% of respondents said they would be enthusiastic or comfortable with a candidate who favors the Arizona law, while just 38% said they would have reservations or be very uncomfortable.
Among white voters, and among voters most interested in the fall elections, an outright majority supported the Arizona law.
For Republicans, the law has been a rallying cry that has boosted support in a year of anti-Washington sentiment.
Indeed, some supporters of Tuesday's lawsuit said it brings political risks for the president and his party in competitive states. In Colorado, for example, a recent poll found that 61% of respondents wanted an Arizona-style law for their state. The GOP front-runner for governor, Scott McInnis, supports the Arizona law and vowed to sign a similar measure in Colorado. His likely opponent, Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said he would veto such a measure.
In Arizona, where the law has wide support, even Democrats said that suing the state would not be productive. Instead, they have called on the federal government to address the broken immigration system and bolster security.
"The lawsuit is misdirected,'' said Democratic Rep. Harry Mitchell, in an interview Tuesday. "It will not solve anything...Our time would be much better spent fixing these problems.''
"I've urged the administration and the Justice Department to focus on immigration reform and not on suing," said Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard, a Democrat who is running for governor.
Jason Rose, a Republican campaign strategist, described the lawsuit as "a political scud missile'' that will damage the three Democratic incumbents, Reps. Mitchell, Ann Kirkpatrick and Gabrielle Giffords.
Attention to the Arizona law could also present risks to some Republicans in states with large Hispanic populations, said Democratic pollster Tom Jenson of Public Policy Polling.
In Texas, Republican Gov. Rick Perry led Democrat Bill White by 12 percentage points in February. But in the wake of the Arizona issue, he said, Gov. Perry now trails among Hispanics by 34 points. That shift has brought the overall race to a tie, Mr. Jenson said.
Mr. Jenson pointed to similar shifts among Hispanic voters in Arizona, Colorado and Nevada. He argued that most white voters will make their decision on other issues, not on immigration. "Where it could have a galvanizing effect is with Hispanic voters," he said.
More troubling for Republicans, analysts said, may be the risk that the GOP develops an anti-immigrant reputation that carries into the 2012 presidential election, when the race will focus on several key states with large Hispanic populations.
Legal experts say the weakest part of the Arizona law is language that makes unlawful presence in the country a state crime. That appears to conflict with federal law, which makes unlawful presence a civil offense but does not classify it as a crime, legal experts say.
But some supporters say the Arizona law has strengths that could provide courts the opportunity to block only some parts of the law, while keeping much of it intact. The law allows other sections to stand even if a portion were to be declared unconstitutional.
Federal law doesn't expressly pre-empt states from passing statutes governing immigrants, said John Eastman, a professor at the Chapman University Law School and an unsuccessful candidate for California state attorney general this year. He said the most important part of the Arizona law, allowing state law enforcement to enforce federal law, could survive even if much of the law were thrown out. "I like the chances of succeeding over the Justice Department," he said.

Full text: Regarding William McGurn's "'," (Main Street, June 29): Republican and Democratic administrations have both amply demonstrated over the years that they do not want to lose the Hispanic vote; consequently, existing federal immigration laws have been ignored. Here's a solution: Let both houses and parties of Congress unanimously agree to enforce current laws by sending troops, building fences, and doing whatever else it takes to secure the border, rather than put up signs warning citizens that they are about to enter a war zone.
If Democrats and Republicans are both perceived by Hispanics as "bad guys," the playing field is leveled and votes will be cast on other vital issues.
Furthermore, a coming together of congressional parties might help to restore confidence in our senators and representatives who are generally perceived as willing to do whatever it takes to stay in office rather than represent their constituents. The June 2010 Rasmussen congressional performance rating states: 56% of U.S. believes Congress is doing a poor job, 12% gives them a good or excellent score.

Full text: PHOENIX -- For nearly 30 years, the governors of the states that line both sides of the United States-Mexico border have gathered to celebrate border bonhomie. They issue proclamations and pledges to work together, air grievances and concerns behind closed doors and pose for the cameras in symbolic showings of cooperation.
But this year the 28th annual conference has collided headlong with Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigration, inspiring bitter recriminations among Mexican governors and rancor among some American ones.
Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona has championed the new state law that gives local police officers broader authority to question people they stop about their immigration status. On Tuesday, the United States Justice Department filed suit to challenge the law.
Ms. Brewer happens by rotation to be the chairwoman and host of this year's conference, scheduled for September at a resort in Phoenix. But after all six Mexican border governors wrote to her to say they intended to boycott the gathering to protest the new law, Ms. Brewer sent a letter of her own last week to the governors on both sides of the border saying she was canceling the whole conference.
"I am disappointed by your decision," she said in a letter June 30. "I sincerely believe the gathering of the governors in Arizona would have presented a great platform to initiate dialogue about the legislation and other topics of great importance to the border region."
The Mexican governors had written that they would not step foot in Arizona because they considered the law, which Ms. Brewer signed in April and continues to promote, to be "based on ethnic and cultural prejudice contrary to fundamental rights."
Their position is in line with that of President Felipe Calderon of Mexico, who has denounced the law on several occasions as a recipe for singling out Mexican citizens, lawfully in the United States or not, for harassment. It also coincides with a boycott announced by major civil rights groups in the United States and several cities and towns.
Now, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico has stepped into the fray, pledging to salvage the conference by finding a site in another state.
"Governor Brewer doesn't have the authority to cancel the Border Governors Conference," Gilbert Gallegos, a spokesman for Mr. Richardson said. "She may not want to host it for political reasons, but that's not a reason to sidestep the tough issues that border governors must address, including migration and border violence. Governor Richardson will look for alternative sites to host the conference, with or without Arizona's participation."
Mr. Richardson, a Democrat and the nation's only Hispanic governor, had lobbied Ms. Brewer, a Republican, not to sign the law, and he has repeatedly condemned it.
A spokesman for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, who took particular pride in hosting the conference in 2008, said he also supported moving it.
It remained unclear if Ms. Brewer would attend the conference if it ended up in another state.
A call to Margie Emmerman, Ms. Brewer's adviser on border affairs and coordinator of the conference, was referred to the governor's press office, which did not respond to a call or an e-mail message on the subject.
Polls in the United States may show that a majority of Americans support the Arizona law, or at least the concept of a state's playing a greater role in immigration enforcement, but abroad the law is strongly opposed and has raised concerns at the State Department that it could strain diplomatic relations with Latin America.
On a recent tour in South America, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was peppered with questions about it at every stop, and she took the unusual step of disclosing that the Justice Department intended to legally challenge it even before government lawyers finished preparing the case.
For now, the conference Web site, hosted by the State of Arizona, shows no sign of the conflict. In fact, Ms. Brewer has a statement on it declaring, "I am excited to host this year's event."
She adds: "We will continue to promote mutual prosperity for the states along the U.S.-Mexico border region, as we foster stronger relations between our two countries. The Border Governors Conference is the premier forum for analysis, dialogue and support for specific initiatives and policies that address the unique needs of our border region."
The forums resemble any international summit, and raise similar questions over what tangible results come of them. A couple of years ago Mr. Schwarzenegger, serving as host in Los Angeles, took a delegation of governors on a fact-finding trip to the Universal Studios theme park.
But aides to the American governors say the conferences have produced concrete results, including agreements to share intelligence on gun trafficking, exchange information on the H1N1 virus and lobby the governors' respective federal governments to improve border crossing infrastructure and procedures and commerce.
There has been tension in the past, including a couple of years ago when all four American governors declared a state of emergency at the border over illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Similarly, when Mr. Schwarzenegger urged in 2005 that the border be closed, his attendance at that year's conference in Torreon, Mexico, rankled Mexicans.
But aides to the governors said they could not recall any previous conference being canceled.

Abstract: The government said Tuesday that its immigration enforcement policy "targets ... dangerous aliens," including violent criminals, gang members, drug traffickers and others "who pose a danger to the national security and a risk to public safety," whereas the Arizona law would force federal officials to cope with a flood of illegal immigrants who pose no danger. In Florida, Rick Scott, a Naples multimillionaire who has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign to be the Republican candidate for governor, recently issued a television ad blasting his primary opponent, Atty. Gen. Bill McCollum, over the Arizona law.

Full text: The Obama administration launched its long-expected legal attack on Arizona's strict new immigration law Tuesday, arguing that only Washington could set the nation's rules for arresting illegal immigrants.
The government said Tuesday that its immigration enforcement policy "targets ... dangerous aliens," including violent criminals, gang members, drug traffickers and others "who pose a danger to the national security and a risk to public safety," whereas the Arizona law would force federal officials to cope with a flood of illegal immigrants who pose no danger.
Innocent Arizonans will suffer as well, the administration said. It foresees "countless inspections and detentions" of people who do not have the correct papers. U.S. officials did not contend that the state law violates federal civil rights laws or the Constitution's equal-protection guarantee.
The lawsuit urges a federal judge in Phoenix to block Arizona's arrest law from taking effect as scheduled July 29. It adds new weight on the side of the pending suits by immigrant rights advocates, who say Arizona's stepped-up enforcement would lead to racial profiling and harassment of Latinos.
President Obama made no public statement upon the filing of the suit, but Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano -- a former Arizona governor -- said the state was out of line.
"Setting immigration policy and enforcing immigration law is a national responsibility," Holder said. "A patchwork of state laws will only create more problems than its solves."
Republican leaders, reacting quickly, said Washington and the administration were to blame for failing to enforce immigration laws over many years. "Suing the people of Arizona for attempting to do a job the federal government has utterly failed to execute will not help secure our borders," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
In April, the Arizona Legislature voted to "discourage and deter" illegal immigrants from staying in the state by requiring the police to question immigrants under some circumstances.
When an officer has "reasonable suspicion" that a person is not a legal resident, he is to ask questions and may take into custody those who cannot show they are legal residents. These illegal residents could be convicted of a state crime and then turned over to federal immigration agents.
But the administration officials said Arizona's policy "disrupts the national enforcement regime." Its legal brief explains what U.S. immigration officials have long acknowledged: They do not wish to arrest or deport the vast majority of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants.
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency said it was on track to deport about 400,000 people this year. But the agency said last week that it did not seek to deport illegal immigrants who were brought here as children or who are caring for children or close relatives.
The administration's lawsuit rests on the Constitution and its declaration that the laws of the United States are the "supreme law of the land." State laws that conflict with federal law are deemed to be "preempted."
The Justice Department argued that Arizona's law should be struck down because immigration "remains the exclusive province of the federal government." If the law were to be put into effect, the government said, it would disrupt federal efforts and upset the "careful balance of immigration enforcement priorities."
The lawsuit was cheered by Latinos, who have grown increasingly disillusioned with the Obama administration over the failure to revamp the immigration system. A Gallup poll showed that Obama's approval rating among Latinos dropped from 69% in January to 57% in May.
Although Latino voters are unlikely to swing to the GOP in great numbers, they could damage the prospects of Democratic candidates in the midterm election in November by staying home. Over the last week, the Obama administration has taken steps to reenergize grass-roots Latino voters.
But nationwide polls have also found that 50% to 60% of Americans support Arizona's effort to arrest more illegal immigrants, and politicians elsewhere have proposed similar provisions in their states.
As of June 30, similar bills had been introduced in five other states, according to the National Council of State Legislatures: South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Michigan.
In Florida, Rick Scott, a Naples multimillionaire who has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign to be the Republican candidate for governor, recently issued a television ad blasting his primary opponent, Atty. Gen. Bill McCollum, over the Arizona law. McCollum says that he supports it but that it's not needed in Florida.
"Rick Scott backs Arizona's law. He'll bring it to Florida and let our police check if the people they arrest are here legally," the ad says.
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer derided Obama's intervention as "nothing more than a massive waste of taxpayer funds. These funds could be better used against the violent Mexican cartels than the people of Arizona."
She also pledged to defend the measure, SB 1070, in court. "The truth is the Arizona law is both reasonable and constitutional. It mirrors substantially what has been federal law in the United States for many decades. Arizona's law is designed to complement, not supplant, enforcement of federal immigration laws."
The new lawsuit also puts vulnerable Democrats in a difficult spot, given the popularity of Arizona's tough new law. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.), who is in a tough reelection fight, issued a statement Tuesday calling the lawsuit "a sideshow distracting us from the real task at hand."
The legal battle may be decided on a fast track. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton has set a hearing for July 22 in Phoenix to hear arguments on whether to block the law from going into effect. If she issues a temporary injunction, the state can immediately appeal to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, and from there, to the Supreme Court.

Hawaii Gov. Linda Lingle (R) on Tuesday vetoed legislation that would have permitted same-sex civil unions. Lingle acted on the final day to either sign or veto the bill, which the legislature approved in late April.
"There has not been a bill I have contemplated more or an issue I have thought more deeply about during my eight years as governor than House Bill 444 and the institution of marriage," Lingle said at a news conference. "I have been open and consistent in my opposition to same-sex marriage, and find that House Bill 444 is essentially same-sex marriage by another name."
State House leaders have said they will not override any of the bills Lingle has vetoed.
The measure intended to grant gay and lesbian couples the same rights and benefits that the state provides to married couples. It would have made Hawaii one of six states that essentially grant the rights of marriage to same-sex couples without authorizing marriage itself. Five other states and the District of Columbia permit same-sex marriage.

ILLINOIS
A mob lured emergency personnel to a housing complex near St. Louis with reports of a blaze, a shooting and other crimes, then attacked them with fireworks and bottle rockets, authorities said.
No one was injured in the onslaughts against Alton, Ill., firefighters and police Sunday night and early Monday.
The attackers apparently intended the assaults as entertainment for a hundreds-strong crowd of adults and children who had gathered at the Oakwood Housing Complex to watch, said Mark Harris, a deputy fire chief who witnessed the attacks.
"Our firefighters got in there and started doing their thing, and out come the fireworks," including bottle rockets and Roman candles, Harris said. "It does appear we were lured in for that purpose."
There was no immediate word on any arrests or charges in the attacks. Firecrackers, bottle rockets and other fireworks are outlawed in Illinois.
Police officers and firefighters were attacked again when they returned to the neighborhood to douse a blazing box early Monday.
Police Chief David Hayes told the Telegraph newspaper that officers tried to control the assailants by firing pepper balls. He said the assaults turned his stomach. "I'm so angry," Hayes said. "This type of conduct is not supposed to happen in civil society."
Hayes did not immediately return calls by the Associated Press seeking comment.

Conn. priest charged with stealing $1.3 million in church funds: A Roman Catholic priest was charged Tuesday with first-degree larceny after police said he stole $1.3 million in church money over seven years to use for male escorts, expensive clothing, and luxury hotels and restaurants. The Hartford Archdiocese asked police to investigate last month after it discovered that the Rev. Kevin J. Gray, 64, a former pastor at Sacred Heart/Sagrado Corazon Parish in Waterbury, Conn., might have taken more than $1 million for personal use. Telephone messages at the office of Gray's public defender were not immediately returned.
34 illegal immigrants caught along Calif. coast: Two groups of illegal immigrants were caught coming ashore along Southern California's coast, including 18 people who landed at the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton, federal officials said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have caught illegal immigrants entering San Diego County by sea more than 60 times since Oct. 1. There were 49 smuggling cases by sea in fiscal year 2009.
W.Va. unions want governor to take Byrd's seat: The West Virginia chapter of the AFL-CIO is asking Gov. Joe Manchin III (D) to appoint himself to the Senate seat left empty by last week's death of Democrat Robert C. Byrd. A Manchin spokeswoman said the governor will not appoint himself.

Farmworker OT; Schwarzenegger should sign a bill giving them overtime after eight hours of labor.

Full text: Farmworkers are the only hourly employees in the state who are not paid overtime after eight hours of labor in a standard 40-hour workweek, a special, discriminatory status that has endured for decades. Now California has an opportunity to right this wrong. State Sen. Dean Florez (D-Shafter) has shepherded a bill through the Legislature that would give those who do the backbreaking work of picking fruits, vegetables and nuts equal status with other workers.
Opposition to the legislation, predictably, comes primarily from the farm lobby, which maintains that the current rule granting overtime only after 10 hours in one day or 60 hours in a week is all the industry can afford. But agribusiness argues in circles. Some growers say their profits would wither if the proposed overtime rules were made mandatory. Others say workers, not farmers, would suffer, because growers would dodge new overtime rules by hiring more employees to work eight-hour shifts. Still others argue that it's consumers who would pay, in the form of higher food prices.
Variations of those arguments were put forth by other industries when the eight-hour workday and 40-hour workweek were debated decades ago. But officials opted to pay workers fairly. The formula can vary -- some lawmakers favor overtime for an eight-hour workday, others prefer a 40-hour week before overtime is required -- but the parameters are not negotiable. Furthermore, if growers eventually elect to hire more workers instead of paying overtime, that's not necessarily a bad thing; job creation is a boon to the state.
We acknowledge that growers may indeed incur additional expenses, and yes, consumers may see a rise in prices. But the new law also would benefit the economy by putting more spending money into the pockets of farmworkers and, perhaps, by creating new jobs. And let's not forget the "subsidy" already enjoyed by consumers and growers: The farming workforce is largely made up of illegal immigrants, who often will work for lower pay than U.S. workers, with few if any benefits. Normalizing their working conditions should be the concern not only of those who favor fair treatment but also of those who understand that employment double standards encourage illegal immigration.
The state's growers do have special labor needs, but the solution is for Congress to pass legislation that would provide them with a steady, legal stream of labor -- not for California to uphold discrimination. We encourage Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign SB 1121.

U.S. Hits Immigration Law --- Suit Against Arizona Curb Sets Up State-Federal Showdown; Risks for Both Parties

Author: Meckler, Laura; Perez, Evan; Jordan, Miriam

Publication info: Wall Street Journal , Eastern edition; New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]07 July 2010: A.1.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/578576593?accountid=14496

Abstract: The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by the Justice Department, sets up a likely Supreme Court clash over state versus federal power that some supporters of the measure hope establishes a new legal precedent. State lawmakers said they were acting because the federal government has failed to protect the state's border with Mexico from encroachment by illegal immigrants.

John Eastman is a professor at Chapman University Law School. A July 7 front-page article about the federal government's lawsuit seeking to block Arizona's immigration law incorrectly stated his title as dean, a post he formerly held.
(WSJ July 23, 2010)
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration set up a legal battle over states' rights and heightened the political stakes on immigration for both parties by filing a suit to block Arizona's tough new immigration law.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by the Justice Department, sets up a likely Supreme Court clash over state versus federal power that some supporters of the measure hope establishes a new legal precedent. Usually, state and local governments steer clear of areas that are considered the jurisdiction of federal authorities under established law. Supporters of Arizona's immigration measure say they were helping to enforce federal law, not supplant it.
The suit comes as immigration is emerging again as a prominent political issue, particularly in states with large Hispanic populations. In several Republican primaries, candidates have backed the Arizona law as they seek to prove to conservative voters that they are the most committed to halting illegal immigration. Many Latino voters are similarly energized in opposition to the law, which many deem to be discriminatory.
The law, which is set to take effect July 29, makes illegal immigration a state crime and requires police to verify the immigration status of people stopped for other alleged crimes. State lawmakers said they were acting because the federal government has failed to protect the state's border with Mexico from encroachment by illegal immigrants.
The suit, filed in Phoenix, said that the state had "crossed a constitutional line" that interferes with the federal authority over immigration. It alleges that the state law would burden federal agencies, diverting resources from such higher priorities as tracking illegal immigrants implicated in terrorism cases, drug smuggling or other crimes.
"Setting immigration policy and enforcing immigration laws is a national responsibility," Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. "Seeking to address the issue through a patchwork of state laws will only create more problems than it solves."
Precedent suggests the Obama administration has the upper hand in the suit. Federal courts, dating back to laws in the 1880s aimed at limiting Chinese immigration, have given the federal government wide latitude to regulate such matters. But in recent decades, courts have also allowed state laws that rely on federal law, such as those denying state benefits to illegal immigrants.
More broadly, federal courts have sided with the federal government in cases of states and cities passing laws that conflict with federal law.
"I think the federal government is going to win and the Arizona law is going to be shown to be unconstitutional," said Karl M. Manheim, professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "States don't have any power to regulate immigration."
Supporters of the law say it is needed to discourage people from crossing into and remaining in the state illegally. Its passage came after years of frustration with the porous southern border, kidnappings and murder.
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer called the federal lawsuit "a massive waste of taxpayer funds" and said the money "could be better used against the violent Mexican cartels than the people of Arizona."
She said that the Obama administration, if worried about a patchwork of laws, could have chosen to sue local governments that adopted "sanctuary" policies instructing police not to cooperate with federal immigration officials.
The lawsuit comes as President Barack Obama and his party are trying to energize a Democratic base that is far less enthusiastic about voting this November than are core Republican voters. At the same time, Democrats have been stymied in trying to move an overhaul of immigration laws through Congress, which strategists say has depressed enthusiasm among Hispanic voters.
The White House declined to say if Mr. Obama planned to travel to Arizona, though he will be in neighboring Nevada this week. A top White House official, homeland security adviser John Brennan, was in Arizona last week discussing border enforcement plans.
White House officials say political considerations did not play a part in the decision to file the lawsuit. Still, Democrats hope that challenging the Arizona law will further solidify the party's reputation for advocating for the Hispanic community.
Some analysts said Tuesday that the Democrats face a tricky balance, given a potential backlash from white, middle-class voters who support the Arizona effort by wide margins in some polls. In a June Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, 45% of respondents said they would be enthusiastic or comfortable with a candidate who favors the Arizona law, while just 38% said they would have reservations or be very uncomfortable. Among white voters, and among voters most interested in the fall elections, an outright majority supported the Arizona law.
For Republicans, the law has been a rallying cry that has boosted support in a year of anti-Washington sentiment.
Indeed, some supporters of Tuesday's lawsuit said it brings political risks for the president and his party in competitive states. In Colorado, for example, a poll found that 61% of respondents wanted an Arizona-style law for their state. The GOP front-runner for governor, Scott McInnis, supports the Arizona law and vowed to sign a similar measure in Colorado. His likely opponent, Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said he would veto such a measure.
In Arizona, where the law has wide support, even Democrats said that suing the state would not be productive. Instead, they have called on the federal government to address the broken immigration system and bolster security. "The lawsuit is misdirected," said Democratic Rep. Harry Mitchell, in an interview Tuesday.
"I've urged the administration and the Justice Department to focus on immigration reform and not on suing," said Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard, a Democrat who is running for governor.
Jason Rose, a Republican campaign strategist, described the lawsuit as "a political scud missile" that will damage the three Democratic incumbents, Reps. Mitchell, Ann Kirkpatrick and Gabrielle Giffords.
Attention to the Arizona law could also present risks to some Republicans in states with large Hispanic populations, said Democratic pollster Tom Jenson of Public Policy Polling.
In Texas, Republican Gov. Rick Perry led Democrat Bill White by 12 percentage points in February. But in the wake of the Arizona issue, he said, Gov. Perry now trails among Hispanics by 34 points. That shift has brought the overall race to a tie, Mr. Jenson said.
Mr. Jenson pointed to similar shifts among Hispanic voters in Arizona, Colorado and Nevada. He argued that most white voters will make their decision on other issues, not on immigration. "Where it could have a galvanizing effect is with Hispanic voters," he said.
More troubling for Republicans, analysts said, may be the risk that the GOP develops an anti-immigrant reputation that carries into the 2012 presidential election, when the race will focus on several key states with large Hispanic populations.
Legal experts say the weakest part of the Arizona law is language that makes unlawful presence in the country a state crime. That appears to conflict with federal law, which makes unlawful presence a civil offense but does not classify it as a crime, legal experts say.
But some supporters say the Arizona law has strengths that could provide courts the opportunity to block only some parts of the law, while keeping much of it intact.
Federal law doesn't expressly pre-empt states from passing statutes governing immigrants, said John Eastman, dean of the Chapman University Law School and an unsuccessful candidate for California state attorney general this year. He said the most important part of the Arizona law, allowing state law enforcement to enforce federal law, could survive even if much of the law were thrown out.

Full text: Regarding William McGurn's "'We Don't Need No Stinkin' Badges!'," (Main Street, June 29): Republican and Democratic administrations have both amply demonstrated over the years that they do not want to lose the Hispanic vote; consequently, existing federal immigration laws have been ignored. Here's a solution: Let both houses and parties of Congress unanimously agree to enforce current laws by sending troops, building fences, and doing whatever else it takes to secure the border, rather than put up signs warning citizens that they are about to enter a war zone.
If Democrats and Republicans are both perceived by Hispanics as "bad guys," the playing field is leveled and votes will be cast on other vital issues.
Furthermore, a coming together of congressional parties might help to restore confidence in our senators and representatives who are generally perceived as willing to do whatever it takes to stay in office rather than represent their constituents. The June 2010 Rasmussen congressional performance rating states: 56% of U.S. believes Congress is doing a poor job, 12% gives them a good or excellent score.

Full text: Picture this: A chart-topping R&B diva, on the cusp of 40, switches gears to become a D.C. college undergrad.
If this scenario, starring one Mary J. Blige, seemed somewhat improbable early Tuesday, by the end of the day it appeared -- well, who knows, maybe possible, someday. But not this year.
The buzz started Friday when Blige performed a Central Park concert for ABC's "Good Morning America." After the TV cameras stopped rolling -- but the Web videographers in the crowd kept going -- she told the crowd her big news: "I never got the chance to graduate from high school, but they gave me my honorary diploma the other day. . . . And I got accepted into Howard University for the class of 2014." She made a similar comment in an interview published in the New Orleans Times-Picayune the following day.
True? The news seemed to catch Howard, the nation's premier historically black university, by surprise. Early Tuesday, a rep for the school declined to address Blige's prospects at the school, noting that information about applicants and admissions is confidential. By late in the day, the university put out a statement suggesting Blige's comments may have been somewhat premature. They were kind about it, though, praising her "resilience and dedication" to her craft: "We encourage Ms. Blige to continue her studies and welcome her consideration of Howard University in the future. We are happy to work with Ms. Blige on completing the formal process for admission."
A manager for Blige disputed that the singer meant to say she had been accepted. Blige (who, as it happens, is promoting a new fragrance line these days) has taken a strong interest in education lately. Last week, she spoke at the graduation for an all-girls public school in the Bronx; she also held a fundraiser to sponsor scholarships for its top students. Earlier in June, she was the guest at an N.Y.C. schools ceremony honoring grads who beat the odds to claim their diplomas.
Apologizing: Levi Johnston to the Palins for telling lies about them. The former fiance of Bristol Palin admitted he "said things that were not completely true" about Sarah Palin and her family after the lovebirds broke up last year, reports People. (No details of what was "not completely" true, however -- or what prompted the apology.) Bristol released her own statement Tuesday: "Part of co-parenting is creating healthy and honest relationships between the parents. . . . If a mistake is made the honorable thing to do is to own up to it."
Married: Zack Bolno to Corinne Rabung on Saturday in Bluemont, Va. The Redskins PR head -- who did the same job for the Wizards -- married the real estate marketing manager in front of former Redskins coach Jim Zorn, former Wizards players Caron Butler and Calvin Booth, former Wizards coach Eddie Jordan and a bunch of local sports reporters.
Lindsay Lohan is headed to jail for 90 days for violating terms of probation in her 2007 drug case. In the hearing Tuesday, Judge Marsha Revel threw out the results of the alcohol detection ankle bracelet, which went off while Lohan was at a MTV Movie Awards after-party last month. The case then centered on the nine court-ordered alcohol education classes that Lohan skipped. "It's like someone who cheats but doesn't think it's cheating if they don't get caught," Revel said. A tearful Lohan was ordered to begin serving time July 20 and enter in-patient rehab afterward. More legal hassles: During a break in the hearing, Lohan was served with papers in the courthouse elevator for $17,000 in unpaid bills to an L.A. boutique.
George Michael was arrested and released Sunday after he drove his Range Rover into the front of a London photo store, British police said Tuesday. The singer, 47, has a history of driving under the influence and has lost his license once; heads to court again next month.
Jackpot! Michael Hastings, author of the infamous Rolling Stone article on Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, has scored a contract with Little, Brown and Co. for a book on the Afghanistan war.
"That was a scary moment for me . . . I had gotten used to the picture of me revealing my ear, looking like Spock's sister."
-- Tracey Ullman on finally giving up her green card after becoming a U.S. citizen in 2006 -- an in-joke for fellow immigrants, required to show their right ears in photos for their work papers. The British-born comic spoke July 4 at a naturalization ceremony for new U.S. citizens at Monticello.

Full text: 'I'm ready to move forward," said President Obama toward the end of his speech last week calling for immigration reform. But "without bipartisan support," he added, "we cannot solve this problem." Mr. Obama blames GOP restrictionists for the lack of progress, but from our longtime pro-reform vantage point his own divisive approach to immigration is equally at fault.
A case study is yesterday's Justice Department lawsuit against the state of Arizona over its new immigration law requiring local police to enforce federal immigration statutes. The suit suggests that, notwithstanding his repeated "Si se puede" pledges on reform to Latino voters, Mr. Obama is more focused on branding the GOP anti-immigrant than he is on signing a reform bill.
The Arizona law is above all else a cry for federal help, and Mr. Obama could have used the law to re-launch a constructive debate on the urgency of reform and the consequences of further delay. Instead, since the law passed in April, the Administration has gone out of its way to pander to liberal activists and other critics of the measure and inflame the already emotional issue.
Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano publicly trashed the legislation by their own admission before they had even read it. Then the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said his agency won't necessarily deport illegals referred by Arizona police under the new law. One of the biggest obstacles to passing reform that combines enforcement with more legal immigration has been convincing a skeptical public that any immigration policy will be enforced.
Now comes the federal lawsuit, which is designed to block the law before it takes effect this month. The suit charges the state with pre-empting federal law in violation of the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, and unlike the case of health care the Constitution does expressly give Congress the power to "establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization." Justice also claims Arizona goes further than federal immigration law by making it a crime for anyone here illegally to solicit work.
The feds may well win their case on the Constitutional merits, and we also oppose the Arizona law on grounds that it is a misuse of scarce police resources. One of its provisions criminalizes anyone who stops to pick up an illegal migrant worker even to do yard work. Arizona police have enough to worry about without making criminals of suburbanites who want help in landscaping their cactus gardens.
On the other hand, the alarmists are wrong to portray the law as creating a new race-based police state. Nearly all of the law mirrors federal immigration statutes and orders local police to enforce those statutes for the first time. Notably, the feds aren't suing Arizona on equal protection grounds, despite Mr. Obama's repeated public and polarizing claims that the law could lead to racial profiling. This, too, betrays the political cynicism behind his public denunciations.
The larger reality is that neither Arizona's law nor the 1,200 National Guard troops recently deployed to the border will stop Mexican migrants from crossing the border to make a better life. In the past two decades, the U.S. Border Patrol's budget has seen a nine-fold increase, and the number of border patrol agents has grown by a factor of five. Yet over that same period the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. has tripled.
Illegal migrants will continue to arrive as long as the demand for entry visas outstrips the supply. To reduce pressure on border communities, politicians would do better to focus on devising guest worker programs and other visa proposals that would allow economic migrants to work here legally. This would reduce human smuggling, document fraud, trespassing and other criminality common in border regions. It would also free limited homeland security resources to focus on gang members, drug dealers and other serious threats.
The Arizona law has polled well nationally, and the unfortunate truth is that elements in both political parties have sought to exploit it. On the right, GOP restrictionists have used it to promote a populist backlash against any immigration reform. They claim we can't have reform until we "secure the borders," but the reality is we can't secure the borders without reform that allows more legal ways to work in America.
Some conservatives also hope to use the issue to further drive voter turnout this fall, as if Republican voters aren't fired up already. And as if there won't be a longer-term electoral cost to a GOP that reinforces liberal stereotypes that it is an Anglo-only party.
As for Democrats, Mr. Obama clearly wants to use the Arizona law to mobilize Latinos against the GOP this year and looking ahead to 2012. Having promised as a candidate to address immigration in his first year as President, Mr. Obama waited until four months before the midterm elections to give his first major immigration speech.
His speech last week praised President Bush for his 2007 attempt at reform, but only as a way of criticizing the GOP for killing it. The truth is that the 2007 failure was bipartisan, as we well know from having been caught in the crossfire. Majority Harry Reid blocked any serious consideration in the Senate.
Mr. Obama's partisan immigration tactics might assuage his own party activists, but in the process he is further alienating Republicans and poisoning the chances for genuine reform through the rest of his Presidency.

Justice Dept. sues Arizona over law; Unusual clash with a state Immigration measure called unconstitutional

Full text: The Obama administration sued Arizona over the state's new immigration law on Tuesday, an assertion of federal power that sets up a rare clash with a state on one of the nation's most divisive political issues.
The Justice Department lawsuit charges that the Arizona law cracking down on illegal immigrants conflicts with federal law, would disrupt immigration enforcement and would lead to police harassment of those who cannot prove their lawful status. Filed in federal court in Arizona, it says the state's measure is unconstitutional and asks a judge to stop it from taking effect.
"The Constitution and the federal immigration laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country," the lawsuit says.
The Arizona law, signed by Gov. Jan Brewer (R) in April, gives police the power to question anyone who they have a "reasonable suspicion" is an illegal immigrant.
In challenging a state law, federal lawyers stepped squarely into the politically charged debate over how to handle the nation's estimated 12 million illegal immigrants. Reaction to the suit poured in from all sides, much of it blistering, making it clear that this was no ordinary legal filing but rather the start of a battle that will help define the midterm elections this fall.
"Not only does this lawsuit reveal the Obama administration's contempt for immigration laws and the people of Arizona, it reveals contempt for the majority of the American people who support Arizona's efforts," 20 House Republicans said in a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who administration officials said decided last week to challenge the law. President Obama, who had voiced strong opposition to the legislation, was briefed in the past few days, officials said.
The administration disavowed any political calculus, with one senior Justice Department official saying: "We're charged not with doing what's popular or partisan or political, but doing what we think is right."
But other Democrats suggested that the legal fight could play to their advantage by placing them on the side of Hispanics, the nation's fastest-growing minority. Though most polls show the Arizona law is broadly popular, leading Hispanic groups and politicians have condemned it.
"There is probably some short-term pain politically," said one senior Democratic strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to publicly contradict the administration. "But considering the demographic changes the country is undergoing, long term there is a lot of upside in advocating for Latinos and comprehensive immigration reform."
Civil rights groups call Arizona's statute the nation's toughest law against illegal immigrants and say it targets Hispanics, though the legislation says police "may not consider race, color or national origin" in seeking to determine immigration status.
At least five other lawsuits have been filed in federal court -- by civil rights groups and others -- challenging the law, which is scheduled to take effect July 29. Hearings are set for July 15 and July 22 in those cases, and Justice Department officials said they expect a hearing around the same time on their motion asking a judge to issue a preliminary injunction blocking the law.
Justice officials cited two other examples of the federal government suing a state, including a 2007 lawsuit by the Bush administration challenging an Illinois law that tried to prevent employers from using an online system to determine immigration status. But legal experts said such a step is exceedingly rare.
"It's quite extraordinary," said Richard D. Friedman, a law professor at the University of Michigan. Typically, he said, the government files briefs or seeks to intervene in lawsuits filed by others against state statutes.
In their 25-page complaint, Justice lawyers cite the legal doctrine of "preemption," which is based on the Constitution's supremacy clause and says federal law trumps state statutes. Because the federal government has "preeminent authority to regulate immigration matters," the lawsuit argues, the Arizona law must be struck down.
Beyond the legal prose, the government tries to make a practical argument: that the Arizona law would unduly burden federal agencies charged with immigration enforcement. With Arizona referring so many illegal immigrants for deportation, the lawsuit says, federal officials would lose focus on top-priority targets such as immigrants involved in terrorism or other crimes.
The suit also claims that the law would burden local law enforcement officials, three of whom provided declarations in support of the challenge. "To require local police to act as immigration agents . . . is not realistic," wrote Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor.
Although the lawsuit cites potential "detention and harassment" of U.S. citizens and immigrants who do not carry identification documents, it declines to make a legal argument that the law would lead to racial profiling. But a senior Justice Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that if the law takes effect, "we will monitor it very, very closely, and if we become aware of any racial profiling or civil rights violations, that's something that we would take action on.''
Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor and an expert on preemption, said that the government makes "a strong argument" but that the case "could go either way." Although the preemption doctrine has been established in Supreme Court decisions, he said, "there is precedent on both sides of the question."
Brewer called the lawsuit "nothing more than a massive waste of taxpayer funds," a sentiment also expressed by other Republicans. "The American people must wonder whether the Obama administration is really committed to securing the border when it sues a state that is simply trying to protect its people by enforcing immigration law," John McCain and Jon Kyl, Arizona's senators, said in a statement.
Liberal groups were equally fervent. "We commend the Obama administration for taking this critical step to negate Arizona's unconstitutional usurpation of federal authority and its invitation to racial profiling," said Lucas Guttentag, head of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project.

Full text: The Obama administration's suit against Arizona's immigration law sets up a likely Supreme Court clash over state versus federal power that some supporters of the measure hope establishes a new precedent.
The Justice Department's suit argues Arizona's measure goes well beyond the intent of federal law by requiring state law enforcement to check the immigration status of anyone suspected of being illegal.
Precedent suggests the Obama administration has the upper hand in the suit. Federal courts, dating back to laws in the 1880s aimed at limiting Chinese immigration, have given the federal government wide latitude to regulate such matters. But in recent decades, courts have also allowed state laws that rely on federal law, such as those denying state benefits to illegal immigrants.
More broadly, federal courts have sided with the federal government in cases of states and cities passing laws that conflict with federal law. In 2006, the Justice Department successfully sued Massachusetts to block a law regulating shipping that aimed to stop oil spills, but which the courts found went beyond federal maritime laws.
The lawsuit against Arizona sets up a clash that conservatives hope will allow at least portions of the state law to survive. Already, the high court is weighing a separate Arizona law establishing penalties for employers that don't check the immigration status of employees, which the Justice Department argues impinges on federal immigration authority.
Legal experts say the weakest part of the Arizona law is language that makes unlawful presence in the country a state crime. That appears to conflict with federal law, which doesn't classify unlawful presence as a crime, legal experts say.
"I think the federal government is going to win," said Karl M. Manheim, professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "States don't have any power to regulate immigration."
But some supporters say the Arizona law has strengths that could provide courts the opportunity to block only some parts of it. The law allows other sections to stand even if a portion were to be declared unconstitutional.
Federal law doesn't expressly pre-empt states from passing statutes governing immigrants, said John Eastman, dean of the Chapman University Law School and an unsuccessful candidate for California state attorney general this year. He said the most important part of the Arizona law, allowing state law enforcement to enforce federal law, could survive even if much of the law were thrown out.
"I like the chances of succeeding over the Justice Department," he said.
"I think anyone that lives in Arizona has to view DOJ's suit as a slap in the face," said Robert Driscoll, an attorney for Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The Justice Department is separately investigating Mr. Arpaio's department over allegations of racial profiling, which he has denied.

Full text: Obama called the U.S.-Israel bond "unbreakable."
After an hourlong Oval Office meeting, Netanyahu said the two discussed "concrete" steps to move toward direct Mideast peace talks, as the two leaders looked to heal frayed bilateral ties. He reaffirmed a commitment to negotiate with Abbas on issues needed to develop an independent Palestinian homeland. Separately, Israel charged a soldier who allegedly shot two Palestinian women waving white flags in 2009 with manslaughter.
Israel said the timing of announcing the charge was coincidental, but it could help to start peace talks.

Full text: AS A MATTER of policy, President Obama was right earlier this year to criticize a harsh new immigration law in Arizona as "misguided." On Tuesday, the Justice Department was right to challenge it as a matter of law.
The Arizona legislation, which was signed in April and scheduled to go into effect at the end of this month, requires police officers to check the immigration status of those who are lawfully stopped if there is "reasonable suspicion" that they are in the country illegally. The law also makes it a crime for undocumented workers to seek employment and authorizes private citizens to sue state agencies that do not enforce the law.
States are free to determine most laws and policies within their borders -- even if the results are reprehensible and shortsighted. What they cannot do is pass laws that trump or ignore the federal government. The Justice Department suit, filed in Phoenix federal court, correctly calls Arizona on this breach, noting that the Constitution and Congress have vested the federal government -- not the states -- with exclusive authority to establish immigration and nationality laws. The Obama administration argues convincingly that allowing states to set their own policy toward immigration could harm U.S. foreign policy and lead to highly disparate treatment of immigrants from state to state.
It's easy to understand the frustration of people in Arizona who decided to take matters into their own legislative hands. Congress for years has ignored practical realities and succumbed to xenophobia and fear-mongering to derail efforts to craft sensible immigration reforms. It's fine to claim a right to "preempt" state law, but that right comes with a responsibility to do the job. The federal government has improved border security; now it needs to provide a pathway for citizenship for those who entered illegally but have otherwise been productive members of society.
President Obama has promised to take up the challenge of immigration reform, but promising action while suing Arizona isn't good enough. The White House and Congress need to step in to fill the void.

Abstract: The government said its immigration enforcement policy "targets ... dangerous aliens," including violent criminals, gang members, drug traffickers and others "who pose a danger to the national security and a risk to public safety" while the Arizona law would force federal officials to cope with a flood of illegal immigrants who pose no danger. In Florida, Rick Scott, a Naples multimillionaire who has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign to be the Republican candidate for governor, recently issued a television ad blasting his primary opponent, Attorney General Bill McCollum, over the Arizona law.

Full text: The Obama administration launched a legal attack on Arizona's strict new immigration law Tuesday, arguing that only Washington can set the nation's rules for arresting illegal immigrants.
The government said its immigration enforcement policy "targets ... dangerous aliens," including violent criminals, gang members, drug traffickers and others "who pose a danger to the national security and a risk to public safety" while the Arizona law would force federal officials to cope with a flood of illegal immigrants who pose no danger.
The lawsuit urges a federal judge in Phoenix to block Arizona's arrest law from taking effect late this month. It adds new weight on the side of the pending suits by immigrant-rights advocates, who say Arizona's stepped-up enforcement would lead to racial profiling and harassment of Latinos.
The move raises the political stakes for the White House. President Barack Obama made no public statement upon the filing of the lawsuit, but Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano -- a former Arizona governor -- said the state was out of line.
"Setting immigration policy and enforcing immigration law is a national responsibility," Holder said. "A patchwork of state laws will only create more problems than it solves."
Republican leaders, reacting quickly, said Washington and the administration deserve the blame for failing to enforce the immigration laws over many years.
"Suing the people of Arizona for attempting to do a job the federal government has utterly failed to execute will not help secure our borders," said Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate.
In April, the Arizona Legislature voted to "discourage and deter" illegal immigrants from staying in the state by allowing the police to question immigrants under some circumstances. When an officer has "reasonable suspicion" that a person is not a legal resident, he is to ask questions and can take into custody those who cannot show they are legal residents. These illegal residents could be convicted of a state crime and then turned over to federal immigration agents.
Administration officials said Arizona's policy "disrupts the national enforcement regime." Their legal brief explains what U.S. immigration officials have long acknowledged. They do not wish to arrest or deport the vast majority of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States.
The administration's lawsuit rests on the Constitution and its declaration that the laws of the United States are the "supreme law of the land." State laws that conflict with federal law are deemed to be "pre-empted."
"A state may not establish its own immigration policy," the Justice Department argued. The state's law should be struck down because immigration "remains the exclusive province of the federal government." If the Arizona law were to be put into effect, the government said, it would "disrupt" federal efforts.
The lawsuit was cheered by a Latino community that has grown increasingly disillusioned with the Obama administration over the failure to revamp the immigration system. A Gallup poll showed that Obama's approval rating among Latinos dropped from 69 percent in January to 57 percent in May. While Latino voters are unlikely to swing to the Republican Party in great numbers, they could damage the prospects of Democratic candidates in the midterm elections in November by staying home.
Over the past week, the administration has tried to re-energize grass-roots Latino voters.
But nationwide polls have also found that from 50 percent to 60 percent of Americans support Arizona's effort to arrest more illegal immigrants, and politicians elsewhere have proposed similar provisions in their states.
As of June 30, similar bills had been introduced in five other states, according to the National Council of State Legislatures: South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Michigan.
In Florida, Rick Scott, a Naples multimillionaire who has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign to be the Republican candidate for governor, recently issued a television ad blasting his primary opponent, Attorney General Bill McCollum, over the Arizona law. McCollum says he supports it, but adds it's not needed in Florida.
"Rick Scott backs Arizona's law. He'll bring it to Florida and let our police check if the people they arrest are here legally," the ad says.
Republican state Rep. William Snyder of Stuart, chairman of the House Criminal and Civil Justice Policy Council, said in May he would support passage of a law modeled on Arizona's.
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer derided Obama's intervention as "nothing more than a massive waste of taxpayer funds. These funds could be better used against the violent Mexican cartels than the people of Arizona."
She also pledged to defend the measure in court. "The truth is the Arizona law is both reasonable and constitutional. It mirrors substantially what has been federal law in the United States for many decades. Arizona's law is designed to complement, not supplant, enforcement of federal immigration laws."
The case may be decided on a fast track. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton has set a hearing for July 22 in Phoenix to hear arguments on whether to block the law from going into effect on July 29. If she issues a temporary injunction, the state can immediately appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, and from there, to the Supreme Court.

Full text: The Obama administration slapped Arizona with a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the state stepped on the federal government's toes by passing a get-tough-on-immigration law.
That's our job, the U.S. Justice Department says in its suit.
But you're not doing it, says Arizona, and the point is well taken. The state's approach to immigration reform is harsh and overreaching. But if Obama wants Arizona -- and the dozen or so other states mulling similar laws -- to stand down, he's going to have to come up with something better. And soon.
The suit asks the court to block the Arizona law from taking effect July 29. Besides usurping federal authority, the government argues, SB 1070 invites racial profiling by instructing police to demand proof of residence from anyone they suspect is in the country illegally. Neither argument is a slam dunk. In similar cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has found that states acted within the scope of their authority. And a court isn't likely to act on the racial profiling claim before any profiling has occurred.
That's all the more reason for a renewed sense of urgency on immigration reform, as signaled by Obama in a speech last week. The president called the Arizona law misguided and warned that a patchwork of 50 different laws would be disastrous. But he also called on Congress to overhaul the dysfunctional immigration system that encourages states to take matters into their own hands.
Americans agree overwhelmingly that the system is broken, but they disagree loudly on how to fix it. Arizona's approach -- called "attrition through enforcement" -- is to make life miserable for illegal immigrants, so that those who aren't deported will leave on their own.
Emboldened by support for SB 1070, some Arizona legislators are now talking about a bill that would deny birth certificates -- and therefore automatic citizenship -- to babies whose parents are here illegally. Gov. Jan Brewer, meanwhile, defends the bill she signed into law by insisting that "we all know" most illegal immigrants are drug mules.
When attrition advocates say the federal government isn't doing its job, they mean it isn't doing enough to keep (or throw) illegal immigrants out. Before they'll consider other reforms, they want the government to seal the border tight.
That's a losing battle as long as there are incentives on this side -- incentives that benefit both immigrants and the American businesses that employ them. For decades, an apt image of our southern border was a big "help wanted" sign fastened to a razor-wire fence. The mixed message: You're not supposed to be here -- but come if you can.
Nowhere is this more true than Arizona. Proximity to Mexico isn't the only reason the state has so many illegal immigrants. Its economy was built on cheap, often illegal, labor -- tourism, agriculture, construction. The flow of immigrants across the border dried up with the job market, but it will resume when the economy picks up. That's why it's important to fix the system now.
The framework for comprehensive reform, as outlined by Obama (and, before him, by President George W. Bush): Border security and workplace enforcement, to ensure workers are here legally. A flexible and realistic visa program, to match the number of visas with the actual needs of our business sector. And a path to legalization for the 11 million already here. That's still a non-starter with some people, who think it rewards lawbreakers. But those immigrants broke the law with the tacit approval not just of the government, but its citizens -- who employed them, directly and indirectly, and benefited from their labor.
For more than a decade, federal lawmakers have ducked immigration reform. Is it any wonder states have run out of patience? Arizona will have done us all a favor if its wrongheaded fix gets Congress off the dime at last.

Federal prosecutors charged a senior al-Qaeda leader Wednesday with helping to mastermind last year's attempted bombing of New York City's subway and said the effort was part of a larger plot that included a failed terrorist attempt in the U.K.
In an indictment unveiled in federal court in Brooklyn, prosecutors said 34-year-old Adnan el Shukrijumah, described as a leader of an al-Qaeda program dedicated to terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other Western countries, "recruited and directed" three U.S. citizens to carry out suicide bombings in Manhattan in September 2009.
The indictment also charged Abid Naseer and Tariq ur Rehman, who were previously arrested by authorities in the U.K. as part of a raid in relation to suspected terrorist activity there. Prosecutors said the two cases were "directly related." The charges underscored "the global nature of the terrorist threat we face," said David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security.
On Wednesday, U.K. police again arrested Mr. Naseer, who is 24 years old and of Pakistani descent, in Middlesbrough, in the northeast of England, according to a police spokesman. Mr. Rehman is not in custody and is believed to be in Pakistan. The last known lawyers for Messrs. Rehman and Naseer couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
Prosecutors said the U.S. and U.K. plots were directly linked by a man identified in court documents as "Ahmad," who was also charged on Wednesday, though he was not in custody and prosecutors said his identity was unknown. Prosecutors said Ahmad transported Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan native who worked as an airport shuttle driver in Colorado, and two others to Waziristan, Pakistan, so they could receive training. Mr. Shukrijumah recruited them at a camp there, prosecutors said.
The indictment, unveiled on the fifth anniversary of bombings in London's transport network, said that Mr. Shukrijumah, together with others, including Saleh al-Somali--an alleged al-Qaeda leader presumed dead--recruited individuals to conduct a terrorist attack in the U.S.
Authorities in the U.S. have been searching for Mr. Shukrijumah, a Saudi Arabia native, for several years and are offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. They are planning to put him on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's most-wanted list as early as Thursday.
Prosecutors described Ahmad as an "al-Qaeda facilitator" and said he communicated separately with Mr. Naseer and Mr. Zazi, who were in Pakistan in the same period in 2008, according to the indictment.
Prosecutors said Mr. Naseer sent emails to the same account that Ahmad allegedly used to communicate with Mr. Zazi. Mr. Naseer referred to different explosives in coded language and spoke of planning a large "wedding" for numerous guests in April 2009, and said Ahmad should be ready, prosecutors alleged. A similar code, meaning an attack was ready to be executed, was used by Mr. Zazi when he discussed the planned New York attack with Ahmad, prosecutors said.
When Mr. Naseer and Mr. Rehman were arrested in the U.K. last year as part of a bigger raid that also led to the arrests of 10 others, U.K. authorities found large quantities of flour and oil, as well as surveillance photographs of public areas in Manchester, according to U.S. authorities.
But "Operation Pathway," which led to the arrests, was carried out prematurely after the U.K.'s top counterterrorism official at the time, Bob Quick, was photographed entering No. 10 Downing Street carrying documents that clearly identified key aspects of the operation. All of the men who were arrested were released without charge due to what U.K. prosecutors believed had been insufficient evidence.
British authorities tried to deport 11 of the men arrested, saying they posed a threat to national security. Mr. Naseer won an appeal in May in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission that stopped his deportation back to Pakistan. The U.S. government is seeking to extradite Mr. Naseer, according to London's Metropolitan police service.
In February, Mr. Zazi pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and other charges. He admitted that he drove to New York last September with explosives and other bomb-making materials and intended to carry out an attack on Manhattan subway lines.
Two other men, Zarein Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin, allegedly traveled to Pakistan with Mr. Zazi. In April, Mr, Ahmedzay pleaded guilty to conspiracy and providing material support to al Qaeda.
Mr. Medunjanin, a part-time building superintendent in Queens, N.Y., has denied wrongdoing and is fighting the charges. Wednesday's indictment adds additional terrorism charges against Mr. Medunjanin, who was arrested in January after allegedly attempting to crash his car into another car on the Whitestone Expressway in Queens as a last attempt to carry out a suicide attack on American soil.
"There's nothing new in the indictment as it pertains to Mr. Medunjanin," said his lawyer, Robert C. Gottlieb. "The government from Day One threatened to add charges as well as defendants."He said his client is not guilty and intends to proceed to trial.

Full text: The U.S. government sued the state of Arizona on Tuesday, challenging the constitutionality of an immigration law set to take effect July 29.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Phoenix, claims the law encroaches on the federal government. The Justice Department is seeking an injunction to block enforcement of the law.
"A state may not establish its own immigration policy or enforce state laws in a manner that interferes with the federal immigration laws," the U.S. wrote in the complaint.
The law makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally. It requires local police officers, after having a law enforcement reason to stop someone, to determine their immigration status if they suspect the person lacks proper documentation.
Tuesday's lawsuit follows several other challenges, including ones by the American Civil Liberties Union and by an Arizona police officer who doesn't want to enforce the statute.
- - -
Arizona immigration law Q&A
Unless it is halted by a judge, Arizona's new immigration law is set to take effect July 29.
What does the law do?
The law essentially mandates that local governments in Arizona enforce immigration laws. The provision that has received the most attention is the creation of a new state crime: failure to possess proper immigration documents.
What are police required to do under the law?
If officers stop, detain or arrest people while enforcing other laws or ordinances and reasonably suspect they are in the country illegally, officers have to try to determine their status.
If police find that the people they've stopped are illegal immigrants, do the police have to arrest them?
No. The law is silent on what police must do once they determine someone is in the country illegally.
What else must police do under the law?
Anyone arrested in Arizona cannot be released until police check with the federal government to determine whether that person is in the country legally.
Does the law require people who are legally in Arizona to carry "papers"?
No. The law specifies that certain documents can be shown to police to demonstrate someone is in the country legally -- any U.S. government ID that is issued only to legal residents.

Full text: In filing its long-awaited suit to block implementation of Arizona's harsh new immigration law, the Justice Department has taken a necessary step to reassert federal authority over immigration enforcement. The Obama administration rightly argues that states cannot be permitted to concoct their own rules and regulations on this issue to suit local needs and local politics, no matter how frustrated they are with the federal government. Allowing states to do so would result in a mishmash of laws handicapping Washington's ability to do its job.
Arizona officials have argued that the state is merely seeking to enforce federal law. But that's not quite right. The new Arizona law, scheduled to take effect July 29, makes it a crime for undocumented immigrants to be in Arizona and requires noncitizens who are in the country legally to carry registration papers with them at all times. It also requires police to check the immigration status of people who are stopped for other reasons if they are "reasonably suspected" of being in the country illegally. But, as the administration notes, being an illegal immigrant is not a federal crime: "Congress has affirmatively decided that unlawful presence -- standing alone -- should not subject an alien to criminal penalties and incarceration." Deportation by the U.S. government, yes; arrest by civil authorities, no.
Furthermore, the United States does not have the wherewithal to deport 11 million people. So federal policy prioritizes the capture, prosecution and deportation of illegal immigrants who threaten national security or who are dangerous or criminal. Arizona's law could force the U.S. government to redirect its efforts to processing untold numbers of illegal immigrants discovered by the police for, say, driving with a broken tail light or jaywalking. What's more, thousands of immigrants are legally present in the U.S. but do not possess federal registration papers, such as those who have applied for asylum or are applying for special visas as victims of trafficking or a violent crime. Arresting them would violate federal policy.
Immigration foes don't believe the government has any interest in halting illegal immigration and have responded to U.S. policy with simplistic slogans such as "What part of illegal don't you understand?" and "Illegal is a crime." But in fact, the situation isn't simple at all. Consider, for example, our relationship with Mexico. As the suit points out, migration flow cannot easily be teased out from the web of interconnecting political, socioeconomic and diplomatic concerns. Trade between the two countries averages $1 billion a day; Mexico is the third-largest supplier of oil to the U.S., and together we combat drug and human trafficking. How we handle immigration will affect these and other issues and is therefore best handled by the federal government.
Admittedly, there is a disconnect between the government's bold assertions of federal authority in the complaint and its contradictory, often confusing policy. For example, the government doesn't just deport criminals, or even mostly criminals. In reality, it apprehends and deports thousands of ordinary people, just as Arizona is threatening to do. Given such inconsistencies, it is understandable that, increasingly, states are growing frustrated and taking matters into their own legislatures. On Tuesday, the government made a clear case for control of immigration policy; now it needs to actually implement one.

Full text: An unsuccessful plan to detonate homemade bombs in the New York subway system last year was orchestrated by senior Al Qaeda leaders who were also plotting a comparable attack in Britain, according to a terrorism indictment unsealed Wednesday.
"The charges announced today illustrated the coordinated and persistent attempts by our adversaries to harm American citizens," said George Venizelos, acting assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office.
Adnan Shukrijumah, a U.S. citizen who was regarded as one of Al Qaeda's best hopes to execute a plot in post-Sept. 11 America, is among several new alleged Al Qaeda figures charged in the botched Manhattan attempt.
Two others indicted Wednesday, Abid Naseer and Tariq Ur Rehman, are also allegedly connected to the attack that was planned for English soil.
"These charges underscore the global nature of the terrorist threat we face," said David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security.
Three U.S. citizens have already been charged with plotting a series of suicide bombings on the New York subway during rush hour that would have taken place days after the eighth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay, both Afghan immigrants, pleaded guilty this year.
Bosnian-born Adis Medunjanin pleaded not guilty.
The indictment alleges that after Zazi was taken into custody, Medunjanin tried again to complete a suicide attack. On Jan. 7, he crashed his car into another vehicle in Queens, N.Y., dialing 911 moments before to state his name and his motives, authorities said.
"We love death," he told the 911 operator, according to the indictment.
The date for his trial has not been set.
Naseer, a British citizen, allegedly exchanged coded e-mails with the American Al Qaeda cell to hatch a plot, detailing plans for a "large wedding." Days before Zazi headed to New York from Colorado in early September, he wrote, "The marriage is ready," signaling that the attack was near execution, the indictment says.
After Naseer and Rehman were taken into custody in England in April 2009, a search of their residences yielded large amounts of flour and oil in addition to surveillance photos and maps of Manchester, the indictment says.
Naseer is in custody in England, and federal prosecutors plan to seek to extradite him for a trial. Rehman is no longer in custody. Shukrijumah's whereabouts are unknown.
In the wake of the New York case and other failed attacks, said David Schanzer, an associate professor and terrorism expert at Duke University, the indictment should boost public confidence in federal officials' ability to intercept a terrorist plot.
"A lot has been made of the attempted bombings in Detroit and Times Square," he said. "This case demonstrates that our intelligence and law enforcement authorities had leads and were able to prevent an attack that originated at the very top of Al Qaeda."

Full text: Javier Prado marks his turf with a plastic folding chair.
Ramon Alvarez guards a concrete bench.
Efren Castellanos, the one they call La Hormiga ("the Ant"), brazenly goes wherever he pleases. He should, he argues. He's been here the longest.
"Just let them try and tell me something," he says. "I've earned my spot."
The Polaroid photographers of MacArthur Park are old-timers, the last of a dying breed. They've been sparring under the palm trees now for nearly 40 years.
Their 5-pound metallic cameras are beat up and outdated. Their film of choice is no longer produced. And these days, hardly anyone -- sometimes no one at all -- stops to have a $5 picture taken in front of the glassy lake.
But walk along the southeast corner of the busy park and you will hear them, one after the other, three voices vying to persuade:
"Foto, foto! Al minuto la foto!"
"Una foto, amigo?"
"Que bonitas las fotos!"
It used to be that posing in front of the lake for an instant photo was a tradition, a rite of passage.
On weekends, the nannies, cooks, seamstresses and construction workers descended from crowded apartment buildings to MacArthur Park.
"That was the first thing they did," Castellanos says. "They came to Los Angeles, they came to the park, they took their photograph."
On some days, up to half a dozen men with cameras slung over their shoulders eagerly competed to do the job.
It was the 1980s, and as immigrants from Central America and Mexico poured into Pico-Union by the thousands, the giant park at its center became the bustling heart of the community.
Photographers proudly displayed their portfolios -- ragged sheets of Polaroid images patched together with clear duct tape. Face after face looked out from the collage, some tall and proud, some stiff and bashful, some dressed in their U.S.A. best, some clad in work uniforms -- always with the same view of the park in the background.
Rarely did they smile as the camera clicked. But within the classic white frame of the Polaroids, everything about their new life in Los Angeles seemed idyllic: the scores of pigeons, the dancing fountain, the buildings reaching for the sky.
It showed those back home how far they'd come; it proved that they had made it.
On a good day back then, the photographers would take home as much as $200.
But they had to fight for every dollar.
They kept count of each other's customers. And whenever one came up with a new way to stand out, his rivals quickly swept in to copy it.
Alvarez dressed all in white and went for colorful props. He decorated the grass around his bench with flags from nearly every Central American country. He dressed people in ponchos and propped giant mariachi hats on their heads.
Castellanos, La Hormiga, offered multiple exposures -- photographs that, like funhouse mirrors, repeated the image of a person's face, the lake, the high-rises and the palm trees.
Prado put his cowboy charm to use. He began to call himself El Aguila ("the Eagle") and, in a giant sombrero, snake boots and collared shirts in loud colors, sang self-written songs to passersby. He smiled and he teased, asking customers about their homelands, their voyage north, their jobs.
The men's success didn't go unnoticed.
Over the decades, scores of others showed up wanting a piece of the park. Alvarez saw opportunity and sold more than 60 cameras to the novices.
That infuriated Castellanos. He hated to see the Guatemalan -- who came to the park long after he did -- call shots on his turf for the new guys.
"He made himself out to be the master, the one who bosses everyone," says Castellanos, a native of Michoacan who began shooting in 1971. "But that old man knows he can't tell me what to do. He knows I got here way before he did."
The two men still show up at the park every day. They work within a dozen feet of each other, close enough to lock eyes every few minutes. But they have not spoken in more than 20 years-- and the looks they give each other are death stares.
--
Over time, only the toughest stuck it out.
Most newcomers quit after a few months, driven off by the feuds or by the park itself.
In the 1990s, as the neighborhood grew into one of the city's most overcrowded, gang fights began to break out at the lake's edge. Drug deals went down in the tunnel. Prostitution took over the restrooms.
For a time, some were forced to pay gangsters $80 plus six free Polaroids a week. The bald young men in baggy jeans would pose menacingly, flashing their gang signs in the air.
The photographers were hassled by drunks and chased away by police. But they never stopped working. Their customers, after all, kept coming.
Until five years ago, business was still decent.
In fact, the best day ever was May 1, 2006.
More than 200,000 immigrants took to the streets to march for their rights. Full of nationalistic pride, they gathered at the park to chant and dance and wave Latin American and American flags. Many were eager for a memento of the historic day.
When Prado saw lines forming in front of his competitors, he ran to his apartment and returned with a suitcase full of Polaroid film -- all the cases he'd been hoarding for the future.
He took more than 400 photos and made $2,000 that day.
The next May 1 and each May 1 after that, he hoped for a repeat. It never came.
This year nearly 60,000 people flooded the streets to protest Arizona's new immigration law. Only seven asked to be photographed.
"Every morning I say this is the day. This is the day when everyone will show up and my luck will change," Prado says. "But it's over. There's nothing here anymore."
--
They have digital and disposable cameras. They have cellphones with cameras. They can go to photo studios that offer entire packages for just $8. Today's park visitors don't need the photographers.
But even after 15 years, Prado can't quit. He has a dream.
The former cop from Mexico City is waiting to be discovered. One day, he believes, when he least expects it, a talent scout from a popular Mexican band like Los Tigres del Norte will walk into the park and hear him sing. When the scout learns of his songwriting skills, he will hire him and make him famous.
"I've already come out in two movies," Prado says. "But the only reason the whole world doesn't know who I am is because they didn't let me talk or sing."
Between photo breaks that can last four or five hours, he sits in his plastic chair and lovingly fills the pages of a dog-eared notebook with lyrics. He tilts his head back and sings in a voice so deep it turns heads on the sidewalk.
His nortenas and ballads speak of the topic he knows best: the lovely Central American ladies he's wooed, first by taking their photographs in the park.
Ever hopeful, the 50-year-old shows up seven days a week.
And so do his rivals.
These days, on a good day, they earn $10, $30. At home, they stockpile boxes of film. When Polaroid quit making it in 2008, the men switched to Fuji. But supplies are tough to find. And since none of the photographers use the Internet, they wait for calls about new shipments and then rush off in pursuit.
Castellanos won't say how much he's made over nearly 40 years, or what he has done with his money. He doesn't want the others to know.
"I'll just say I have enough," he says.
He was in his late 20s when he first arrived at the park. At 68, he is determined to be the last to leave -- even if showing up day after day isn't always easy.
Three years ago, the job took such a toll he could hardly bring himself to set foot inside the park. Sales were dropping and he grew depressed, fatigued and lonely. He would drive in from East Los Angeles, only to sit in his car and fight back anxiety attacks.
"I panicked just thinking about it," he says. "But I would tell myself, 'If you let yourself be defeated, if you walk away, they win.' "
So Castellanos decided to take a vacation -- his first. He flew to Argentina and Brazil for two weeks. He returned refreshed and with a new idea: He'd buy a giant backdrop to hang from the palm trees.
He chose Rio de Janeiro's statue "Christ the Redeemer," convinced his fellow Latinos would flock to pose in front of it. But the image only confused people.
"They would ask, 'Is that Jesus from Guanajuato?' 'Is he from El Salvador?' "
When he tried another backdrop with a view of the skyscrapers around Pershing Square, people still were not interested. It wasn't until he hung up a 10-foot-by-10-foot backdrop of MacArthur Park itself that passersby took notice.
Now, Castellanos places people in front of the canvas lake, though in most frames one can still catch a glimpse of the real one in the background. It makes no sense, the photographer admits, but it gives him an advantage. And that motivates him to keep working.
Like the others, Alvarez, 78, says he doesn't do it for the money.
His children tell him to stop making the trip by train each day, two long hours each way from Van Nuys. But the old man won't listen. Even after he broke his leg and became dependent on a powered wheelchair, he continued to show up, toting his miniature flags and sheets of samples.
He says he always loved photography, ever since he was 8 and first saw a man at a giant church in Guatemala shoot black-and-whites of tourists.
"I knew then I would make this my profession," he says.
He tried. But his father pushed him to become a construction contractor, and that's what he was -- for nearly 50 years.
It wasn't until he arrived in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s, curious to explore the United States, that he again found the freedom to shoot.
Lying on his concrete bench to rest his tired feet, he tries to think of a good reason to quit. But nothing comes to mind.
"This is no good anymore, I know," Alvarez says. "But I will go on until I can't go any further. Until I can't walk. Until I can't see."

Federal prosecutors charged a senior al Qaeda leader Wednesday with helping to mastermind last year's attempted bombing of New York City's subway and said the effort was part of a larger plot that included a failed terrorist attempt in the U.K.
Three suspected al Qaeda members were arrested in Europe Thursday morning in what Norwegian and U.S. officials said was a bombing plot linked to the New York and U.K. plans.
In an indictment unveiled in federal court in Brooklyn Wednesday, prosecutors said 34-year-old Adnan el Shukrijumah, described as a leader of an al Qaeda program dedicated to terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other Western countries, "recruited and directed" three U.S. citizens to carry out suicide bombings in Manhattan in September 2009.
The indictment also charged Abid Naseer and Tariq ur Rehman, who were previously arrested by authorities in the U.K. as part of a raid in relation to suspected terrorist activity there. Prosecutors said the two cases were "directly related." The charges underscored "the global nature of the terrorist threat we face," said David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security.
On Wednesday, U.K. police again arrested Mr. Naseer, who is 24 years old and of Pakistani descent, in Middlesbrough, in the northeast of England, according to a police spokesman. Mr. Rehman isn't in custody and is believed to be in Pakistan. The last known lawyer for Mr. Naseer didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Rehman, 39, reached in Peshawar, North East Pakistan, said: "Of course I deny all these charges. Of course I will fight my case."
A day later, three men were arrested on suspicion of "preparing terror activities," the Norwegian Police Security Service said. Two of the men were arrested in Norway and one in Germany, said Janne Kristiansen, the head of Police Security Service. She said one of the men was a 39-year-old Norwegian of Uighur origin, who had lived in Norway since 1999. The other suspects were a 37-year-old Iraqi and a 31-year-old citizen of Uzbekistan, both of whom have permanent residency permits in Norway. The three had been under surveillance for more than a year.
Officials told the Associated Press that the men were attempting to make portable but powerful peroxide bombs, but it wasn't clear whether they had selected a target for the attacks. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe the plan was organized by Salah al-Somali, al Qaeda's former chief of external operations who was charge of plotting attacks world-wide but is believed to have been killed in a CIA drone airstrike last year.
U.S. prosecutors, meanwhile, said the New York and U.K. plots were directly linked by a man identified in court documents as "Ahmad," who was also charged on Wednesday, though he wasn't in custody and prosecutors said his identity was unknown. Prosecutors said Ahmad transported Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan native who worked as an airport shuttle driver in Colorado, and two others to Waziristan, Pakistan, so they could receive training. Mr. Shukrijumah recruited them at a camp there, prosecutors said.
The indictment, unveiled on the fifth anniversary of bombings in London's transport network, said that Mr. Shukrijumah, together with others, including Mr. al-Somali recruited individuals to conduct a terrorist attack in the U.S.
Authorities in the U.S. have been searching for Mr. Shukrijumah, a Saudi Arabia native, for several years and are offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. They are planning to put him on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's most-wanted list as early as Thursday.
Prosecutors described Ahmad as an "al Qaeda facilitator" and said he communicated separately with Mr. Naseer and Mr. Zazi, who were in Pakistan in the same period in 2008, according to the indictment.
Prosecutors said Mr. Naseer sent emails to the same account that Ahmad allegedly used to communicate with Mr. Zazi. Mr. Naseer referred to different explosives in coded language and spoke of planning a large "wedding" for numerous guests in April 2009, and said Ahmad should be ready, prosecutors alleged. A similar code, meaning an attack was ready to be executed, was used by Mr. Zazi when he discussed the planned New York attack with Ahmad, prosecutors said.
When Mr. Naseer and Mr. Rehman were arrested in the U.K. last year as part of a bigger raid that also led to the arrests of 10 others, U.K. authorities found large quantities of flour and oil, as well as surveillance photographs of public areas in Manchester, according to U.S. authorities.
But "Operation Pathway," which led to the arrests, was carried out prematurely after the U.K.'s top counterterrorism official at the time, Bob Quick, was photographed entering No. 10 Downing Street carrying documents that clearly identified key aspects of the operation. All of the men who were arrested were released without charge due to what U.K. prosecutors believed had been insufficient evidence.
British authorities tried to deport 11 of the men arrested, saying they posed a threat to national security. Mr. Naseer won an appeal in May in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission that stopped his deportation back to Pakistan. The U.S. government is seeking to extradite Mr. Naseer, according to London's Metropolitan police service.
In February, Mr. Zazi pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and other charges. He admitted that he drove to New York last September with explosives and other bomb-making materials and intended to carry out an attack on Manhattan subway lines.
Two other men, Zarein Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin, allegedly traveled to Pakistan with Mr. Zazi. In April, Mr, Ahmedzay pleaded guilty to conspiracy and providing material support to al Qaeda.
Mr. Medunjanin, a part-time building superintendent in Queens, N.Y., has denied wrongdoing and is fighting the charges. Wednesday's indictment adds additional terrorism charges against Mr. Medunjanin, who was arrested in January after allegedly attempting to crash his car into another car on the Whitestone Expressway in Queens as a last attempt to carry out a suicide attack on American soil.
"There's nothing new in the indictment as it pertains to Mr. Medunjanin," said his lawyer, Robert C. Gottlieb. "The government from Day One threatened to add charges as well as defendants." He said his client isn't guilty and intends to proceed to trial.

Full text: Author: John C. Lechleiter
America is the inventing nation. A stream of inventions helped make the 20th century the American century.
We've always welcomed a diverse group of dreamers from across the globe and offered them opportunities to advance by virtue of their hard work. We believe in the free flow of ideas and built a public education system that was once the envy of the world.
We have also steadfastly maintained a strong business climate that promotes the value of innovation and reinforces Americans' frontier spirit that sees obstacles as challenges to be overcome.
Unfortunately, America's economy is in danger of losing what has always been our greatest competitive advantage: our genius for innovation.
A recent study ranked the U.S. sixth among the top 40 industrialized nations in innovative competitiveness, but 40th out of 40 in "the rate of change in innovation capacity" over the past decade. The ranking, published last year by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, measured what countries are doing--in higher education, investment in research and development, corporate tax rates, and more--to become more innovative in the future. The U.S. ranked dead last.
In other words, we're at serious risk of falling behind.
The evidence is certainly mounting that we are facing today nothing short of an innovation crisis in America's life sciences. The industry I know best, biopharmaceuticals, is facing unprecedented pressure. R&D costs continue to rise, fewer potential new medicines gain regulatory approval, and key products lose patent protection. In fact, the number of new molecular entities approved by the FDA over the past five years--92--is lower than in any other five-year period since I entered the industry in the late 1970s.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world is not standing still. The U.S. is not the only country looking to the life sciences to drive economic growth, and the very qualities that brought much of the world's research capacity to our shores could just as easily attract that work to Asia or elsewhere.
What will it take to preserve our lead in innovation?
Let me be clear: When it comes to sustaining innovation, the burden remains on enterprising businesses.
The one thing that industry has a right to ask of public policy is to help preserve the environment in which innovation is possible. The pursuit of innovation in any field is a difficult, high-risk venture. If innovation is to take root and grow, it requires a combination of elements I would describe as an "ecosystem."
The first element of this ecosystem is an atmosphere in which innovation can thrive, a society that understands and appreciates scientific inquiry, and free markets where innovators can expect to be rewarded for the risks they take and the value they create. This has always been an American strength. Yet today you'll hear some people say that we have all the innovation we need--or that, in this difficult economic climate, we just can't afford it. But innovation is not the problem. It's the solution.
The second element of the ecosystem--nutrients--come in the form of monetary investments. For investors to take the risks associated with innovation, they must have a fair chance at earning a return for successful work. That requires solid protection of intellectual property; a fair, rigorous and transparent system of regulation; and a tax system that provides companies the ability and incentives to invest in innovation.
The Senate continues to debate tax legislation already passed by the House that could prove pivotal for America's innovative companies.
While the legislation would extend the R&D tax credit, the bill also includes international tax revenue raisers that will hurt the U.S. economy and deplete American jobs. These taxes further exacerbate the problems with our corporate tax system, which is already out of step with the rest of the world. We need a system that provides the "nutrients" for investment in the United States.
The final and most important elements are the seeds of innovation, which equate to talented people and their ideas. Human beings--with their talent and energy, creativity and insights--are a priceless resource, but one that is woefully underdeveloped in this country.
There are three policies necessary to cultivate these seeds of innovation. First, with our kids falling further behind on international comparisons in education, we've got to get serious about broad improvement in science and math instruction in our grade schools and high schools.
Second, we need immigration laws that allow and encourage top scientists from other countries to choose to work in the United States. This does not entail drastic changes, but a sensible increase in visas for highly skilled immigrants and a shorter, simpler green-card application process.
Third, we need a well-funded basic research infrastructure within academic and government labs. What's required is not some new "Manhattan Project," but a long-term funding commitment necessary to attract more outstanding scientists to basic research and keep them engaged in productive work throughout their careers.
Such policies can unleash America's true capacity for innovation. With the right choices, we can preserve and enhance America's priceless legacy of creativity in the life sciences and high-tech fields. The stakes couldn't be higher. Innovation is the key to ensuring that when people look back at the 21st century, they will say that it was the second American century.

In a summer campaign, the United Farm Workers of America is challenging unemployed Americans to harvest the grape, peach and lettuce crops.
Expectations are low. The union's campaign, called "Take Our Jobs," is intended to highlight the role of illegal workers in feeding Americans and to goad Congress to overhaul U.S. immigration policy.
"I can't imagine we'll find that many Americans want to work in the fields," said Arturo Rodriguez, president of the California-based union.
Immigration has reemerged as a prominent national issue since Arizona passed a controversial law to crack down on illegal immigrants that is set to take effect July 29. This week, the Obama administration filed a lawsuit to block it, heightening the political stakes on immigration for both parties ahead of November elections.
About 1.8 million people work on U.S. farms. About three-quarters of them are foreign-born and more than half are illegal immigrants, according to the Department of Labor. The union says the proportion of undocumented workers in the fields is even higher.
But kicking them out, the union argues, would lead to crops rotting in the fields, higher food prices and a greater reliance on imports.
"If we asked all the undocumented immigrants to leave the country, the agriculture industry would die," Mr. Rodriguez said.
Farmer associations are also backing the campaign. And on Thursday , Mr. Rodriguez was scheduled to make an appearance on Comedy Central's "Colbert Report" to publicize it.
Opponents of legalizing undocumented workers say the problem is more nuanced than the UFW suggests. The labor shortage is caused by the agriculture sector's unwillingness to offer fair wages, argues the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which calls for curbs on immigration to the U.S. "There are certainly American people who would be attracted to this work if pay and working conditions were better," said Ira Mehlman, a federation spokesman.
The union sees the nation's 9.5% unemployment rate as an opportunity to make its case on immigration. In a letter sent to every member of Congress, the union tries to provoke elected officials, calling on them to "help people you represent get back to work" by having them apply for farm jobs.
On its web site, , job applicants can get assistance from the union "to replace the undocumented farm workers everyone seems to believe are the cause of high unemployment," as it says in its letter to lawmakers.
"Missing from the debate...is an honest recognition that the food we all eat--at home, in restaurants and workplace cafeterias (including those in the Capitol)--comes to us from the labor of undocumented farm workers," says the union letter. "We are a nation in denial about our food supply."
Since announcing the campaign on June 24, the UFW says that its normally overlooked Web site has gotten an unprecedented two million hits. On the job link, applicants can fill out a form under the heading "I want to be a farm worker." The union helps match them to potential employers.
About 5,300 people have applied. Three ended up in the field, said the union.
Many applicants became disillusioned when they learned of the typical $8-to-$9-an-hour pay, said UFW spokeswoman Maria Machuca. "They were asking for $1,200 a week," she said. Others gave up when they realized that the jobs "weren't around the corner" andthat farmers wouldn't pay for relocation.
Anthony Miskulin is one of the three that followed through. The 31-year-old father was laid off from an office-manager job at a car-rental company. He heard about the field work on the UFW website, though he said the job he ended up taking was listed on Craigslist.At a farm outside Austin, Texas, he starts his day at 4:30 a.m.--"because it gets pretty hot" and ends it at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m.
Barely two weeks into harvesting beets and heirloom tomatoes for $10 an hour, he said, "Honestly, any work is hard work...When I find an occupation that pays more, I'll jump ship."

Full text: Gov. Jan Brewer called off a September border conference in Phoenix because of Mexican governors' objections to Arizona's tough new immigration enforcement law.
It was Arizona's turn to host the 28th annual U.S.-Mexico Border Governors Conference for four U.S. governors and six from Mexico. Brewer said that the meeting was canceled because the Mexican governors planned to boycott it, and that she hoped the governors of New Mexico, Texas and California would support her decision.
However, the governors of New Mexico and California are trying to proceed with the conference in another state, with or without Arizona's participation, spokesmen said.
In a June letter, governors from the Mexican states of Baja California, Coahuila, Sonora, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas said Arizona's new law violates civil rights and has provisions based on ethnic and cultural prejudices.
They suggested relocating the conference to a different U.S. border state.

Re "Right words on immigration," Editorial, July 3
The Times stretches credulity in asserting that President Obama offered a solution for the immigration system when he suggested that the U.S. "reaffirm its identity as a nation of immigrants." Interpreting that statement as a solution to any problem is incomprehensible.
It would also be impossible to defend, today, the statement that we are currently a "nation of immigrants." With all due respect to our historical origins, we are no longer a nation of immigrants but a nation of hardworking Americans. As we have learned, Obama does not consider America exceptional in any way when compared with any other country; it is absurd, therefore, to give any credence to his rhetorical claim that the genius of America will be a "magnet" for all who "yearn for opportunity."
The speech offered nothing in the way of analysis or solution, and was not, as The Times suggested, "a good beginning, a welcome note of civility in the ugly immigration debate." Even by Obama standards, it was an empty speech.

The millions of United States citizens who are now having trouble finding employment probably find Obama's words about amnesty quite wrong. I do. Is this really an appropriate time to contemplate dilution of the labor pool -- and a dramatic expansion of the Social Security recipient base?
Although I voted for Obama, I now sorely regret it. He seems every bit as intent on the destruction of the middle class as his predecessor was.
It is obvious to me that many of the aliens in question will, if the president has his way, be placed on a fast track to voting status, since they obviously will be beholden to his faction of the Democratic Party.
I am beginning to think that Arizona has the right idea.

Re "An echo of Bush on immigration," July 4
Obama's speech was more than just an echo. It sounded like an ultimatum.
Yes, we'd all like to see our immigration problems get straightened out, but first there are a few things Washington needs to fix.
Let's start with enforcement. Congress has the authority to make immigration laws. Who enforces the laws is not so clear. The president should clarify this area. The 50 states can't all have their own versions of immigration law enforcement.
Next, Congress has to fix E-Verify. Enforcement agencies must share information with each other. Otherwise, abuses of our tax laws, personal identity fraud and the employment of undocumented workers will continue unabated.
Finally, we do have a language problem. Both George W. Bush and Obama insisted that any new citizens "learn English." If this is a requirement for citizenship, why are election materials printed in seven different languages here in Los Angeles County?
This issue could end up in the Supreme Court. If so, at least we'll have some guidelines -- and the sooner, the better.

The government vs. Arizona
Re "U.S. files suit to block Arizona law," July 7
My government has filed suit against Arizona and its attempt to deal with the illegal immigration problem after decades of neglect by federal law enforcement, saying that Arizona's attempt would "force federal officials to cope with a flood of illegal immigrants who pose no danger."
I disagree. Illegal anything poses a danger to the rule of law on which this nation is founded. Political correctness has triumphed over the integrity of evenly enforcing law for all.
And we are to believe that the Obama administration can and will winnow out the terrorists, narco-traficantes, criminals and psychos and admit the rest, when thus far it has been unable to find its rear end in any field in which it has endeavored?

It's obvious the federal government hasn't been doing its job securing the Mexican border. At last a state is taking action ... and Obama is suing the state.
Maybe the states should sue the federal government for not protecting our borders.
Get illegal immigrants out of my country.

Oil and its consequences
Re "Fighting oil spill, heat and despair," Column One, July 2
I found it ironic that one of the workers hired by BP for the Gulf Coast cleanup crews said he commutes "100.8 miles each way."
This illustrates just one of many examples of our country's dependency on oil -- and looking at the really big picture, shows us how many of us are just as responsible for this oil leak as BP and our government.
Comparing the situation with drug use: If our country were not so dependent on oil and did not need its constant "fix," we would not have rigs out there in the gulf and so close to our shores. God forbid one of the rigs off of our California coast ever has such an accident.

Two candidates for governor
Re "Party fears for its frugal candidate," July 5
Jerry Brown is running a great campaign. It is the equivalent of Muhammad Ali's "rope-a-dope" strategy against George Foreman in 1974.
This time, it's the corporate behemoth, Meg Whitman, who is wasting her financial strength, spending tens of millions on ads that get exposed for their lies -- while Brown refuses to waste campaign money on media buys this early, since he is already well known among much of the voting population.
Let's also remember Brown is not sitting still in Zen-like passivity. He is meeting people throughout the state, and has been willing to face and interact with reporters in the media, unlike Whitman. Brown has called for multiple debates, while Whitman cowers in fear. We can expect Brown to charge hard, Ali-like, around Labor Day as Whitman shadowboxes herself into a corner with self-inflicted blows to her credibility.
Jerry Brown is the once and future champion of California.

::
With regard to Brown's funding gap versus Whitman's ad blitz: Maybe if Whitman had used her megabucks to restore funding to Los Angeles' public libraries, maybe if she had reached into her very deep pockets to bring art or music to our public schools, maybe then I would have considered voting for her.
However, the thought of those millions pouring out to her own very personal favorite charity -- Gov. Meg Whitman -- just doesn't do it for me, and I think I speak for many concerned voters.

Save what can be saved
Re "Edendale: a paradise lost," Column, July 1
Hector Tobar laments the erosion of a forgotten Edendale, stating, "In another, prouder city, we'd do more to keep alive the history on that hillside and others like it."
Well, many of us do have that kind of pride, and continue to work with the City Council to save hillside gems that still exist -- like the Southwest Museum. This piece of Los Angeles history is being forgotten needlessly. The Autry is stealing the priceless collection and neglects the landmark building.
Won't Tobar and other Times writers use their pens to insist on saving history that still remains, instead of pining over things already lost?
Charles Fletcher Lummis, a Times city editor, was the founder the Southwest Museum -- the first museum in Los Angeles.
Get involved and use the prominent voice you have to help save the history that is still alive and viable. Help save the Southwest Museum.

Abstract: Federal prosecutors charged a senior al-Qaeda leader Wednesday with helping to mastermind last year's attempted bombing of New York City's subway and said the effort was part of a larger plot that included a failed terrorist attempt in the U.K. In an indictment unveiled in federal court in Brooklyn, prosecutors said 34-year-old Adnan el Shukrijumah, described as a leader of an al-Qaeda program dedicated to terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other Western countries, "recruited and directed" three U.S. citizens to carry out suicide bombings in Manhattan in September 2009.

Full text: Federal prosecutors charged a senior al-Qaeda leader Wednesday with helping to mastermind last year's attempted bombing of New York City's subway and said the effort was part of a larger plot that included a failed terrorist attempt in the U.K.
In an indictment unveiled in federal court in Brooklyn, prosecutors said 34-year-old Adnan el Shukrijumah, described as a leader of an al-Qaeda program dedicated to terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other Western countries, "recruited and directed" three U.S. citizens to carry out suicide bombings in Manhattan in September 2009.
The indictment also charged Abid Naseer and Tariq ur Rehman, who were previously arrested by authorities in the U.K. as part of a raid in relation to suspected terrorist activity there. Prosecutors said the two cases were "directly related." The charges underscored "the global nature of the terrorist threat we face," said David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security.
On Wednesday, U.K. police again arrested Mr. Naseer, who is 24 years old and of Pakistani descent, in Middlesbrough, in the northeast of England, according to a police spokesman. Mr. Rehman is not in custody and is believed to be in Pakistan. The last known lawyers for Messrs. Rehman and Naseer couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
Prosecutors said the U.S. and U.K. plots were directly linked by a man identified in court documents as "Ahmad," who was also charged on Wednesday, though he was not in custody and prosecutors said his identity was unknown. Prosecutors said Ahmad transported Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan native who worked as an airport shuttle driver in Colorado, and two others to Waziristan, Pakistan, so they could receive training. Mr. Shukrijumah recruited them at a camp there, prosecutors said.
The indictment, unveiled on the fifth anniversary of bombings in London's transport network, said that Mr. Shukrijumah, together with others, including Saleh al-Somali -- an alleged al-Qaeda leader presumed dead -- recruited individuals to conduct a terrorist attack in the U.S.
Authorities in the U.S. have been searching for Mr. Shukrijumah, a Saudi Arabia native, for several years and are offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. They are planning to put him on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's most-wanted list as early as Thursday.
Prosecutors described Ahmad as an "al-Qaeda facilitator" and said he communicated separately with Mr. Naseer and Mr. Zazi, who were in Pakistan in the same period in 2008, according to the indictment.
Prosecutors said Mr. Naseer sent emails to the same account that Ahmad allegedly used to communicate with Mr. Zazi. Mr. Naseer referred to different explosives in coded language and spoke of planning a large "wedding" for numerous guests in April 2009, and said Ahmad should be ready, prosecutors alleged. A similar code, meaning an attack was ready to be executed, was used by Mr. Zazi when he discussed the planned New York attack with Ahmad, prosecutors said.
When Mr. Naseer and Mr. Rehman were arrested in the U.K. last year as part of a bigger raid that also led to the arrests of 10 others, U.K. authorities found large quantities of flour and oil, as well as surveillance photographs of public areas in Manchester, according to U.S. authorities.
But "Operation Pathway," which led to the arrests, was carried out prematurely after the U.K.'s top counterterrorism official at the time, Bob Quick, was photographed entering No. 10 Downing Street carrying documents that clearly identified key aspects of the operation. All of the men who were arrested were released without charge due to what U.K. prosecutors believed had been insufficient evidence.
British authorities tried to deport 11 of the men arrested, saying they posed a threat to national security. Mr. Naseer won an appeal in May in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission that stopped his deportation back to Pakistan. The U.S. government is seeking to extradite Mr. Naseer, according to London's Metropolitan police service.
In February, Mr. Zazi pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and other charges. He admitted that he drove to New York last September with explosives and other bomb-making materials and intended to carry out an attack on Manhattan subway lines.
Two other men, Zarein Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin, allegedly traveled to Pakistan with Mr. Zazi. In April, Mr, Ahmedzay pleaded guilty to conspiracy and providing material support to al Qaeda.
Mr. Medunjanin, a part-time building superintendent in Queens, N.Y., has denied wrongdoing. Wednesday's indictment adds additional terrorism charges against Mr. Medunjanin, who was arrested in January after allegedly attempting to crash his car into another car on the Whitestone Expressway in Queens as a last attempt to carry out a suicide attack on American soil.
"There's nothing new in the indictment as it pertains to Mr. Medunjanin," said his lawyer, Robert C. Gottlieb. He said his client is not guilty and intends to proceed to trial.

Full text: Sarah Palin is waging a battle inside the "tea party" movement to exempt defense spending from the group's small-government, anti-deficit fervor.
There's growing concern among Republicans -- and especially among the pro-defense neoconservative wing of the party -- that national security spending, which is under a level of scrutiny and pressure not seen since the end of the Cold War, could fall victim to the tea party's anti-establishment, anti-spending agenda. The former Alaska governor, as the unofficial leader of the movement and its most prominent celebrity, is moving to carve out such funding from any drives to cut overall government expenditures.
"In the conservative ranks and within the party, she's really quite a crucial piece in this puzzle," said Tom Donnelly, a defense fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "She's got both political and tea-party/small-government bona fides, but she also has a lot of credibility in advocating for military strength."
Palin's drive to lead the charge against defense cuts was on display in a June 27 speech at "Freedom Fest," a conservative gathering in Norfolk where she sent a clear message to Republicans that deficit reduction can't come at the military's expense.
"Something has to be done urgently to stop the out-of-control Obama-Reid-Pelosi spending machine, and no government agency should be immune from budget scrutiny," she said. "We must make sure, however, that we do nothing to undermine the effectiveness of our military. If we lose wars, if we lose the ability to deter adversaries, if we lose the ability to provide security for ourselves and for our allies, we risk losing all that makes America great. That is a price we cannot afford to pay."
Palin also took on Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a Republican, challenging his drive to rein in procurement spending and reevaluate the need for certain huge weapons systems.
"Secretary Gates recently spoke about the future of the U.S. Navy. He said we have to ask whether the nation can really afford a Navy that relies on $3 [billion] to $6 billion destroyers, $7 billion submarines and $11 billion carriers. He went on to ask, 'Do we really need . . . more strike groups for another 30 years when no other country has more than one?' " Palin said. "Well, my answer is pretty simple: Yes, we can and yes, we do, because we must."
The State Department is issuing cards for crossing the U.S.-Mexico border that may be vulnerable to counterfeiting, according to a new report.
In 2008, the department's Bureau of Consular Affairs took over from the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service the job of producing and issuing passport cards, which Americans can use as a cheaper alternative to passports, and border crossing cards, which are used by Mexican nationals who cross the border regularly.
But the Government Accountability Office said in a report released last Thursday that "State does not fully understand the security and durability of the [U.S. passport] card." Although the department "generally" is following accepted standards and procedures for designing the passport cards, it didn't test the final version -- leaving opportunities for forgery.
The Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection bureau intercepted more than 13,000 fraudulent border crossing cards in 2009. Last July, one month after the cards became mandatory, the DHS's Forensic Document Laboratory informed border patrol officers that counterfeits were appearing at U.S. ports of entry and issued an alert about how to detect fakes.
The lab, which specializes in travel-document fraud, told the GAO that State should use a different material and a higher standard of engraving to make the cards, and put more visible security features on them.
Department officials said they don't think the benefits would be worth the expense.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's director of speechwriting, Lissa Muscatine, will be leaving the State Department, she tells the Cable in an interview.
Muscatine, who runs the shop of scribes who put words in Clinton's mouth every day, is stepping down to pursue her own writing, teaching and speaking opportunities, she said. She has worked for both Clintons off and on since 1993.

Full text: An unsuccessful plan to detonate homemade bombs in the New York subway system last year was orchestrated by senior al-Qaida leaders who were also plotting a comparable attack in the United Kingdom, according to a terrorism indictment unsealed Wednesday.
"The charges announced today illustrated the coordinated and persistent attempts by our adversaries to harm American citizens," said George Venizelos, the FBI's New York acting assistant-director-in-charge.
Adnan Shukrijumah, a U.S. citizen regarded as one of al-Qaida's best hopes to execute a plot after Sept. 11, 2001, is among several new al-Qaida figures who were charged in the botched Manhattan attempt.
Two others indicted Wednesday, Abid Naseer, a British citizen, and Tariq Ur Rehman, are also allegedly connected to the attack that was planned for English soil.
"These charges underscore the global nature of the terrorist threat we face," said David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security.
Three U.S. citizens have already been charged with plotting a series of suicide bombings on the New York subway that would have taken place days after the eighth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay, both Afghan immigrants, pleaded guilty in April.
Bosnian-born Adis Medunjanin pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. The indictment alleges that after Zazi was taken into custody, Medunjanin tried again to complete a suicide attack. On Jan. 7, he crashed his car into another vehicle in Queens, N.Y., dialing 911 moments before to state his name and his motives.
"We love death," he told the 911 operator, the indictment said.
Prosecutors allege that Shukrijumah, a Saudi Arabian-born 34-year-old, worked with al-Qaida leaders Saleh al-Somali and Rashid Rauf to recruit Zazi, Ahmedzay and Medunjanin to carry out the New York plot. Shukrijumah, al-Somali and Rauf were leading al-Qaida's "external operations" program, the unit responsible for terrorist attacks in the Western world.
"Ahmad," an al-Qaida facilitator based in Peshawar, Pakistan, communicated with Zazi and Naseer. Ahmad, who was not further identified, was also charged.

Abstract: On the floor in the center of the gallery, a stack of color posters shows the dry, cracked red soil of Terrace Park Cemetery in Holtville, Calif., just north of Mexicali, where dead immigrants whose names are unknown are often buried in unmarked graves. In a second gallery, a 16-minute single-channel video ponders the situation of a University of Utah student, 27, who committed a creative act of nonviolent civil disobedience in December 2008 by bidding at a federal auction of oil and gas drilling leases, which he had no intention of paying for.

Full text: An imposing pair of new landscape works and seven small figure drawings by Andrea Bowers speak in smart, blunt and compelling terms about a fundamental trait of American experience. The progressive promise of a better life, especially for the next generation, has been central to myth and reality from the arrival of the Mayflower to the slogan of hope that drove the last presidential campaign. Bowers' absorbing, multidimensional exhibition, "Political Landscape," shows how powerful -- and fraught -- that trait can be.
"No Olvidado (Not Forgotten)" is an immense drawing, 10 feet tall and nearly 100 feet wide, made on more than 20 sheets of paper that wrap three walls. Initially it recalls the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, listing row after row of names. The drawing indeed memorializes, but what it remembers is the tragic loss encountered in a different struggle.
The names record men, women and children who died trying to cross the border from Mexico into the United States. They're entwined with a representation of chain link fencing, topped by coils of razor wire. On the floor in the center of the gallery, a stack of color posters shows the dry, cracked red soil of Terrace Park Cemetery in Holtville, Calif., just north of Mexicali, where dead immigrants whose names are unknown are often buried in unmarked graves.
Incongruously, Bowers' drawings are streaked with dappled sunlight. The template for its invisible but suggested landscape is not the harsh, arid desert where the crossings take place but a Claude Monet painting of his sumptuous water lily garden. Both are actual places transformed through art into sites of contemplation.
Bowers' drawing was made by covering blank sheets with vinyl cutouts of chain-link, razor-wire and letters, then applying silvery graphite over them. When the vinyl mask was peeled off, both the fence and the names assumed the discrepant tactility of negative spaces.
For the names, absent people assume a ghostly physicality. The fence is a ghost made tangible. Borders between nations are of course imaginary constructs, born not of nature but of law, history and the exercise of power. Bowers' deft representation is unsentimental yet moving.
The small figure drawings are based on photographs taken at a May political rally, when as many as 60,000 immigrants and their supporters joined a lively march through downtown L.A. Each drawing shows a single figure carrying a sign or, in two cases, wearing a shirt with a written logo. (The sweatshirt of a middle-aged man wrapped in an American flag is emblazoned "Mexico," while a young girl's T-shirt says "My parents are not criminals.") Bowers skillfully renders them isolated at the margins of the sketchpad-size sheets, surrounded by empty expanse.
A marvelous correspondence emerges between the incisive signs held up (or worn) by the drawings' protagonists and the drawings as themselves a type of handmade sign. Anonymous voices in a crowd merge with the artist's singular voice.
In a second gallery, a 16-minute single-channel video ponders the situation of a University of Utah student, 27, who committed a creative act of nonviolent civil disobedience in December 2008 by bidding at a federal auction of oil and gas drilling leases, which he had no intention of paying for. "The United States v. Tim DeChristopher" alternates shots of the bleakly beautiful, wintry landscape with an interview on his motives and the moral implications of his heroic action.
The auction, rushed into place in the closing weeks of the Bush administration, was later invalidated for irregularities by the Obama administration. DeChristopher remains in legal jeopardy, having successfully bid $1.7 million for 22,500 acres of land around Arches and Canyonlands parks. Several unsuccessful bids also drove up costs for other lease-buyers. A federal court case is scheduled for September.
Bowers' video simply lets DeChristopher speak. His calm clarity is impressive. The work is less a dissertation on brutal petroleum politics than on the ethical power of peaceful civil disobedience.
The interview is cut with shots of the artist striding toward us across the contested landscape, snow crunching underfoot. She finally stops to write on a small, hand-held chalkboard, which she holds up to fill the frame. Shades of the May immigration drawings, each sign declares the parcel number of the natural landscape cited in the auction. Bowers constructs an oddly jarring disruption out in the boundary-free wilderness, jolting a man-made conflict into focus.

At ground zero of housing crash
The optical lushness of gold-toned silver printing collides with the visual decrepitude of ruined and half-built houses in the desert in photographs by Mark Ruwedel. The Cal State Long Beach professor has been photographing the American West for a few decades, and he displays a nuanced knowledge of its endlessly circling contradictions.
The 21 pictures at Gallery Luisotti were made over the last three years. They are given a certain urgency -- not to mention poignancy -- by the collapse of the high-flying residential real estate market that likely drove the construction of many of the pictured buildings. The cruel fantasy of an "ownership society" pushed by politicians, banks and brokerages in the early half of this decade reverberates against the simple beauty of Ruwedel's best works.
"Desert Springs #3" shows a big, remote, partly built two-story house isolated against a rocky hill. Now abandoned amid bleak grandeur, looking like the architectural equivalent of a long-gone mastodon, it exudes a "what were they thinking?" sense of puzzlement -- and loss. The rugged landscape speaks of social isolation, whether sought after or imposed.
"Hinkley #17" is a euphemistic desert ranch house, not unlike the former presidential stage-set in Crawford, Texas, its doors and windows missing and the landscaping dried up. "Dusk #22" seems to have a glimmer of life inside, although the light in the windows seems an illusion created by a setting sun.
Ruwedel works in a "New Topographics" tradition. His record of domestic ambivalence and social decay finds affinities with artists as diverse as John Divola, Judy Fiskin and Edward Burtynsky.
The format is typically minimalist, with buildings frontal, light even and subjects set in a middle ground. Ruwedel puts considerable empty landscape between a viewer and a house -- a respectful distance, but one that also effectively isolates "home" as an emotional place midway between an infinity of sky and the intimacy of hard earth beneath the camera's tripod.

Depicting death and mourning
The famed Cimitero Monumentale in Milan, Italy, is the starting point for a lovely group of 11 collage-drawings by Canadian artist Scott Treleaven, who works in Paris. The 19th century cemetery is known for its elaborate sculptural decorations, personifications of death and its aftermath that here are used to start an animating process.
In his second solo show at Marc Selwyn Fine Art, Treleaven begins by collaging a cut-out figure, usually male and photographed in black and white, onto a sheet of paper. The fragment of cemetery embellishment is then embellished with drawing.
Vinyl paint, wax pastel, gouache and acrylic, often in vibrant hues, is liberally applied. Vigorous gestures of the artist's hand surround frozen sculptural gestures made by angels, mourners, consoling figures and other symbols of lamentation.
Sometimes paint covers pictured body parts, fragmenting the figure. In one, a muscled arm parallels an adjacent leg to create a torqued rectangle. In another, a despondent figure kneels by a blocky tomb, twisting in sultry display.
Expressionist gestures being as dead a motif as the interred bodies, the slurry of green pigment that obliterates the first torso and the atmospheric cloud of golden color that erases the second's head are their own luxurious reward. Treleaven's drawings offer a High Romantic rumination. Mortality and memory are essential engines for the meaningful satisfactions of sensual play.

Portraiture gets scrambled
"John Baldessari season" continues apace in Los Angeles, with a show of fragmented recent paintings at Margo Leavin (closing Saturday) and a full 50-year retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art now joined by six recent mixed-media prints at Gemini GEL. Like the paintings, the large prints employ silhouettes that simultaneously conceal and reveal.
They're funny too. Each pictures a black, stocking-clad right foot set against a flat background in one of three color combinations. A hole in the sock lets the big toe stick out. It's like a hulking portrait emerging from an inky shroud -- Manet looking at Berthe Morisot, perhaps.
For reasons I can't explain, the configuration reminds me of Marty Feldman's Igor in Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein" or the old joke that Richard Nixon's face looked like a foot. Maybe that's because Baldessari scrambles portraiture's ancient conventions, which are bound up in idealized aggrandizement.
Here, by contrast, the least attractive body part -- and the one physically farthest from a face -- is deployed in its most mundane and embarrassing pose. Baldessari nonetheless lavishes rigorous formal attention on each "Foot and Stocking (With Big Toe Exposed)": The sock is applied fabric, the toenail a collage element adorned with clear varnish, the colors systematically applied. The result is a loving and intimate portrait that is hard to look at, and all the better for the effort.

Full text: Arizona's law giving local police immigration enforcement powers is likely to be struck down, most legal experts predict, now that the Obama administration has gone to court asserting that it conflicts with federal law.
They cite the longstanding principle that the federal government has exclusive control over immigration and that "no state can add or take away" from the policy set in Washington.
However, they caution that one large uncertainty is that the current Supreme Court has not ruled directly on such a state-federal clash over immigration.
Traditionally, the federal government's view carries extra weight in disputes over immigration.
"It's one thing for MALDEF [Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund] or the ACLU to say this [Arizona law] interferes with federal policy. It is quite a different thing when the federal government goes to court and says it," said Jack Chin, a University of Arizona law professor. "The clear rule has been that states do not have the power to regulate immigration."
Arizona's leaders have said their law does not conflict with federal immigration policy. However, the Justice Department argued that the state exceeded its authority by making it a state crime for an illegal immigrant to apply for a job or to be caught without immigration papers.
Such "unlawful presence" is a civil violation, not a federal crime, and thus the state cannot make this immigration violation into a crime, the department contended.
The administration also asserted that the federal policy is to target "dangerous aliens" such as violent criminals, fugitives and gang members, rather than to arrest and deport the millions of illegal immigrants living in this country.
"There is a tension between the federal policy and the state of Arizona," said Washington lawyer Paul Virtue, former general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, an agency that no longer exists. "The state is setting different priorities and different penalties."
The Constitution authorizes Congress to set a "uniform rule of naturalization" and says the laws of the United States are the "supreme law of the land." The Justice Department cites this basic provision in arguing why the Arizona law should be declared "invalid, null and void."
In one famous case, the Supreme Court in 1941 threw out a Pennsylvania law that required immigrants to carry an "alien identification card." The justices ruled that the state had no such authority.
In recent years, some states and cities have sought to enforce restrictions on illegal immigrants on the basis that the federal government had failed to enforce the existing laws.
Most of those efforts have run aground, however. A federal judge in Los Angeles blocked California's Proposition 187 from taking effect in 1994 on the grounds that it regulated immigration. The state dropped its appeal before the case was decided by an appellate court. Three years ago, a federal judge blocked Hazleton, Pa., from prohibiting illegal immigrants from renting housing.
Some legal experts think the Supreme Court may be ready to reconsider the issue.
"This is an unsettled area of constitutional jurisprudence. The last major pronouncement on the question was against a completely different landscape," said Temple University law professor Peter Spiro. The justices "may be willing to cut [states] some slack in the face of Washington's now persistent failure to deal with immigration reform."
On June 28, the high court announced it will hear a separate Arizona immigration case in the fall. The Arizona Legislature voted to take away the business licenses of employers who continue to knowingly hire illegal workers. To the surprise of many, a federal district court judge and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that law, citing a provision in the 1996 law passed by Congress.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce appealed and won the backing of the Obama administration. The court then voted to hear the case.
The current court also may view more favorably the Arizona law giving police more arrest authority.
"It wouldn't surprise me that five members of the court would think that the mere enforcement of immigration law does not change immigration law," said John Eastman, dean of the Chapman University School of Law.
Arizona's lawyers say their law, due to take effect July 29, would not conflict with federal law because it authorizes police during a lawful stop to question a person when there is a "reasonable suspicion" he or she is here illegally.
If a judge blocks the measure from taking effect, the state can immediately appeal to the 9th Circuit Court.
The state may also seek a quick appeal to the Supreme Court if that fails.

Full text: On the heels of a poll that showed Republican gubernatorial nominee Meg Whitman improving her standing among Latinos, Democratic rival Jerry Brown on Thursday launched an appeal to this vital bloc of voters, who are crucial to his election but have yet to show strong allegiance to him.
Brown, flanked by more than a dozen Latino leaders at Cal State L.A., said Latinos would not be duped by Whitman's recent overtures and would remember the Republican's harsh words about illegal immigration during the GOP primary.
"Listen, you can put up your billboards in Spanish and you can buy stuff on Spanish television, but the people aren't fooled. The people know the truth," he said. "Between now and November, we're going to deliver that message up and down the state."
Brown has come under withering criticism by fellow Democrats for his campaign's lack of visible energy and lack of outreach to Latinos. This week, the campaign hired its first fluent Spanish speaker, and a spokesman said its website would be translated into Spanish soon.
Whitman has already hired a Spanish-language speaker to work with Spanish-language media and had her website translated months ago. But she has faced challenges with Latinos because of the GOP primary's focus on illegal immigration and because her campaign chairman, former Gov. Pete Wilson, is viewed as a pariah by many Latinos.
Since the June 8 primary, Whitman has aired ads on Spanish-language television during the World Cup and on radio. Her campaign has erected billboards in Latino communities and spoken on Spanish-language media outlets. Her efforts appear to be paying off.
Though Brown held an 11-point lead among Latino voters in a Field Poll released earlier this week, Whitman had the support of 39%, a 14-point gain since March and at the level that strategists say she needs to be to win in November.
"Any Republican running statewide has to get at least one-third of the Latino vote," said Allan Hoffenblum, a former Republican consultant and publisher of the nonpartisan California Target Book. "Jerry Brown very, very badly needs to aggressively go after that Latino vote."
Democrats unveiled their strategy Thursday, recounting both Brown's history in pushing measures beneficial to Latinos and Whitman's own words during the primary.
Pressured by primary opponent Steve Poizner, Whitman spoke out aggressively against illegal immigration. However, she also took some heat for saying she opposed Proposition 187, the 1994 ballot measure that would have denied taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants, and the new Arizona law that compels police, when stopping someone on a suspected violation, to determine the immigration status of those they think are in the country illegally.
During the primary, Whitman acknowledged the more moderate positions in response to questions, but did not include them in her campaign ads. Now, however, she is touting her opposition to both the measures in ads and billboards.
Democrats argue that Whitman's positions are contradictory. In her Republican primary radio ad called "Tough as Nails", she said that "Illegal immigrants should not expect benefits from the state of California." That, they note, was the point of Proposition 187, the measure she said she opposed.
"While our community is bilingual, we're not naive," state Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Pacoima) said at the Cal State L.A. event. "Put on any billboards whatever you want, we know what you have said."
Brown noted that Whitman has said that students who are illegal immigrants should not be allowed to attend public universities.
"That's cruel," he said. "There's something really not very human about that."
The Democrats also zeroed in on Wilson, who was the most visible supporter of Proposition 187.
"Jerry Brown broke bread with Cesar Chavez," said U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles). "His opponent breaks bread with Pete Wilson."
A spokesman for the Whitman campaign noted that Whitman and Brown share some of the same views on immigration, such as ending sanctuary cities and opposing the Arizona law, and mocked his decision to appear with lawmakers at a time when the Legislature can't close a massive budget gap or draft a budget.
"After 40 years in politics, it's fitting that Gov. Brown's Latino outreach includes a lot of Sacramento politicians, but excludes any specific plans for creating jobs or fixing our public schools," said spokesman Hector Barajas.
"Rather than solve the state's $19-billion deficit, which is costing Californians $52.3 million a day, it's clear these politicians would rather shirk responsibility and fight for their status-quo candidate."

The selective modesty of Barack Obama

Author: Krauthammer, Charles

Abstract: It began with the almost comical self-inflation of his presidential campaign, from the still inexplicable mass rally in Berlin in front of a Prussian victory column to the Greek columns framing him at the Democratic convention. [...] it carried into his presidency, from his posture of philosopher-king adjudicating between America's sins and the world's to his speeches marked by a spectacularly promiscuous use of the word I. Notice, too, how Obama habitually refers to Cabinet members and other high government officials as my -- my secretary of homeland security, my national security team, my ambassador.\n

Full text: Remember NASA? It once represented to the world the apogee of American scientific and technological achievement. Here is President Obama's vision of NASA's mission, as explained by administrator Charles Bolden:
"One was he wanted me to help re-inspire children to want to get into science and math; he wanted me to expand our international relationships; and third and perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science and math and engineering."
Apart from the psychobabble -- farcically turning a space-faring enterprise into a self-esteem enhancer -- what's the sentiment behind this charge? Sure America has put a man on the moon, led the information revolution, won more Nobel Prizes than any other nation by far -- but, on the other hand, a thousand years ago al-Khwarizmi gave us algebra.
Bolden seems quite intent on driving home this message of achievement equivalence -- lauding, for example, Russia's contribution to the space station. Russia? In the 1990s, the Russian space program fell apart, leaving the United States to pick up the slack and the tab for the missing Russian contributions to get the space station built.
For good measure, Bolden added that the United States cannot get to Mars without international assistance. Beside the fact that this is not true, contrast this with the elan and self-confidence of President John Kennedy's 1961 pledge that America would land on the moon within the decade.
There was no finer expression of belief in American exceptionalism than Kennedy's. Obama has a different take. As he said last year in France, "I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism." Which of course means: If we're all exceptional, no one is.
Take human rights. After Obama's April meeting with the president of Kazakhstan, Mike McFaul of the National Security Council reported that Obama actually explained to the leader of that thuggish kleptocracy that we, too, are working on perfecting our own democracy.
Nor is this the only example of an implied moral equivalence that diminishes and devalues America. Assistant Secretary of State Michael Posner reported that in discussions with China about human rights, the U.S. side brought up Arizona's immigration law -- "early and often." As if there is the remotest connection between that and the persecution of dissidents, jailing of opponents and suppression of religion routinely practiced by the Chinese dictatorship.
Nothing new here. In his major addresses, Obama's modesty about his own country has been repeatedly on display as, in one venue after another, he has gratuitously confessed America's alleged failing -- from disrespecting foreigners to having lost its way morally after 9/11.
It's fine to recognize the achievements of others and be non-chauvinistic about one's country. But Obama's modesty is curiously selective. When it comes to himself, modesty is in short supply.
It began with the almost comical self-inflation of his presidential campaign, from the still inexplicable mass rally in Berlin in front of a Prussian victory column to the Greek columns framing him at the Democratic convention. And it carried into his presidency, from his posture of philosopher-king adjudicating between America's sins and the world's to his speeches marked by a spectacularly promiscuous use of the word "I."
Notice, too, how Obama habitually refers to Cabinet members and other high government officials as "my" -- "my secretary of homeland security," "my national security team," "my ambassador." The more normal -- and respectful -- usage is to say "the," as in "the secretary of state." These are, after all, public officials sworn to serve the nation and the Constitution -- not just the man who appointed them.
It's a stylistic detail, but quite revealing of Obama's exalted view of himself. Not surprising, perhaps, in a man whose major achievement before acceding to the presidency was writing two biographies -- both about himself.
Obama is not the first president with a large streak of narcissism. But the others had equally expansive feelings about their country. Obama's modesty about America would be more understandable if he treated himself with the same reserve. What is odd is to have a president so convinced of his own magnificence -- yet not of his own country's.

Full text: America is the inventing nation. A stream of inventions helped make the 20th century the American century.
We've always welcomed a diverse group of dreamers from across the globe and offered them opportunities to advance by virtue of their hard work. We believe in the free flow of ideas and built a public education system that was once the envy of the world.
We have also steadfastly maintained a strong business climate that promotes the value of innovation and reinforces Americans' frontier spirit that sees obstacles as challenges to be overcome.
Unfortunately, America's economy is in danger of losing what has always been our greatest competitive advantage: our genius for innovation.
A recent study ranked the U.S. sixth among the top 40 industrialized nations in innovative competitiveness, but 40th out of 40 in "the rate of change in innovation capacity" over the past decade. The ranking, published last year by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, measured what countries are doing -- in higher education, investment in research and development, corporate tax rates, and more -- to become more innovative in the future. The U.S. ranked dead last.
In other words, we're at serious risk of falling behind.
The evidence is certainly mounting that we are facing today nothing short of an innovation crisis in America's life sciences. The industry I know best, biopharmaceuticals, is facing unprecedented pressure. R&D costs continue to rise, fewer potential new medicines gain regulatory approval, and key products lose patent protection. In fact, the number of new molecular entities approved by the FDA over the past five years -- 92 -- is lower than in any other five-year period since I entered the industry in the late 1970s.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world is not standing still. The U.S. is not the only country looking to the life sciences to drive economic growth, and the very qualities that brought much of the world's research capacity to our shores could just as easily attract that work to Asia or elsewhere.
What will it take to preserve our lead in innovation?
Let me be clear: When it comes to sustaining innovation, the burden remains on enterprising businesses.
The one thing that industry has a right to ask of public policy is to help preserve the environment in which innovation is possible. The pursuit of innovation in any field is a difficult, high-risk venture. If innovation is to take root and grow, it requires a combination of elements I would describe as an "ecosystem."
The first element of this ecosystem is an atmosphere in which innovation can thrive, a society that understands and appreciates scientific inquiry, and free markets where innovators can expect to be rewarded for the risks they take and the value they create. This has always been an American strength. Yet today you'll hear some people say that we have all the innovation we need -- or that, in this difficult economic climate, we just can't afford it. But innovation is not the problem. It's the solution.
The second element of the ecosystem -- nutrients -- come in the form of monetary investments. For investors to take the risks associated with innovation, they must have a fair chance at earning a return for successful work. That requires solid protection of intellectual property; a fair, rigorous and transparent system of regulation; and a tax system that provides companies the ability and incentives to invest in innovation.
The Senate continues to debate tax legislation already passed by the House that could prove pivotal for America's innovative companies.
While the legislation would extend the R&D tax credit, the bill also includes international tax revenue raisers that will hurt the U.S. economy and deplete American jobs. These taxes further exacerbate the problems with our corporate tax system, which is already out of step with the rest of the world. We need a system that provides the "nutrients" for investment in the United States.
The final and most important elements are the seeds of innovation, which equate to talented people and their ideas. Human beings -- with their talent and energy, creativity and insights -- are a priceless resource, but one that is woefully underdeveloped in this country.
There are three policies necessary to cultivate these seeds of innovation. First, with our kids falling further behind on international comparisons in education, we've got to get serious about broad improvement in science and math instruction in our grade schools and high schools.
Second, we need immigration laws that allow and encourage top scientists from other countries to choose to work in the United States. This does not entail drastic changes, but a sensible increase in visas for highly skilled immigrants and a shorter, simpler green-card application process.
Third, we need a well-funded basic research infrastructure within academic and government labs. What's required is not some new "Manhattan Project," but a long-term funding commitment necessary to attract more outstanding scientists to basic research and keep them engaged in productive work throughout their careers.
Such policies can unleash America's true capacity for innovation. With the right choices, we can preserve and enhance America's priceless legacy of creativity in the life sciences and high-tech fields. The stakes couldn't be higher. Innovation is the key to ensuring that when people look back at the 21st century, they will say that it was the second American century.

Abstract: According to subsequent news accounts in Russia and this country, he was a defector reaping his reward for spying for the United States. According to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the domestic successor to the KGB, he was paid about $100,000 over time, which was transferred to an account at a Spanish bank.

Full text: Correction: A July 9 A-section article about the four people released by Russia as part of a spy swap misstated the age of Gennady Vasilenko, a former KGB officer, at the time of his arrest in 2005. He was 63, not 84. (Published 7/13/2010)
In the world of spy vs. spy, the four Russians released by Moscow on Thursday appeared to have little in common with the 10 "sleeper" agents the Obama administration freed in return.
The 10 posed as modern, upwardly mobile city dwellers, living the American dream while they trolled for contacts in the government and think tanks that could be exploited by what one U.S. law enforcement official called Russia's "professional" spies.
Three of the four whom Russia traded for them were professionals -- once successful career officers in the Russian intelligence service.
One had been convicted of being a double agent for the United States, and another pleaded guilty to giving KGB secrets to the British intelligence agency, MI6. The third was never charged with espionage but was fired from the service under suspicion that he had developed a dangerous friendship with a CIA counterpart. He was arrested years later on charge of illegal weapons possession apparently unrelated to his KGB past.
The fourth was Igor Sutyagin, a 45-year-old arms control and nuclear weapons researcher for a Moscow think tank who had no known intelligence background yet spent the past 11 years in a prison camp after being convicted of passing sensitive information to the CIA through a British front company. Sutyagin had consistently maintained his innocence, noting that he had no security clearance and no secrets to reveal.
The KGB veterans have vastly different stories.
Alexander Zaporozhsky was a decorated officer whose KGB career began in the depths of the Cold War in 1975 and abruptly ended with his reported retirement in 1997. A year later, he appeared in the Washington area with his wife and two sons. He described himself as an immigrant; Russian news reports said he had defected, escaping with his family via Prague. They lived for a while in Northern Virginia, and moved in 1998 to Cockeysville, Md., where they bought a house for about $400,000.
Zaporozhsky told his neighbors that he ran an international consulting business from his home. They thought he was a Russian spy. According to subsequent news accounts in Russia and this country, he was a defector reaping his reward for spying for the United States.
In 2001, Zaporozhsky was lured to Moscow for what his wife said he thought was a KGB reunion. He was arrested at the airport. His tearful wife, in Maryland, told reporters that it was all a fabrication, asking why he would have openly traveled back to Russia, under his own name, if he had been a double agent.
Tried for espionage in 2003, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison despite his protestations that there was no proof he had committed treason. But "the evidence was so well documented," the Moscow Gazeta reported, "that judges sentenced the traitor to two years longer than the prosecution demanded."
Sergei Skripal, also a KGB colonel, had also retired by the time he was charged in 2004 with having spied for the British Secret Intelligence Service, beginning in the late 1990s. According to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the domestic successor to the KGB, he was paid about $100,000 over time, which was transferred to an account at a Spanish bank.
"Skripal had received the secret information that he reported to the British services from former colleagues after leaving the military," the FSB said in a release at the time of his trial in 2006. The Russian daily Izvestia said at that time that Skripal passed the identities of "dozens of his former colleagues operating in Europe under cover, in particular, their secret meeting venues, addresses and passwords."
Prosecutors originally sought a 15-year sentence. It was reduced to 13 years because he cooperated with investigators, confessed and was in poor health, according to the FSB.
KGB Maj. Gennady Vasilenko was arrested in 1988 in Havana and brought back to Moscow, where he was interrogated about his contacts with Jack Platt, a CIA officer in Washington. According to several published accounts, the two were unable to recruit each other and ended up friends. But after six months of imprisonment and interrogation, Vasilenko was released without charge and fired.
He and Platt eventually went into business together, providing security services in Moscow and the United States for international companies. In 2005, however, Vasilenko, then 84, was again arrested in Moscow and charged with illegal weapons possession. In 2006, he was sentenced to three years in prison; it is unknown whether he was released by the time this week's swap was arranged.

Full text: Unless it is halted by a judge, Arizona's new immigration law is set to take effect July 29.
The Obama administration sued in federal court Tuesday to block the law, arguing only Washington can set the nation's rules for arresting illegal immigrants. Civil rights groups have also filed suit. Here are some questions and answers on the measure.
Q. What does the law do?
A. The law essentially mandates that local governments in Arizona enforce immigration laws. The provision that has received the most attention is the creation of a new state crime: failure to possess proper immigration documents.
It also forbids local entities, such as city councils or police departments, from making it a policy to ignore federal immigration laws. It allows people to sue if such a policy is formulated.
Q. What are police required to do under the law?
A. If officers stop, detain or arrest people while enforcing other laws or ordinances and reasonably suspect they are in the country illegally, police have to try to determine their immigration status if it's practicable.
In other words, police don't have to determine someone's legal status if there's a shootout going on. They also get a pass if inquiring would hinder an investigation -- by scaring off witnesses, for example.
Q. If police find that the people they've stopped are illegal immigrants, do the police have to arrest them?
A. No. The law is silent on what police must do once they determine someone is in the country illegally.
Q. Does the law require people who are legally in Arizona to carry "papers"?
A. No. The law specifies that certain documents can be shown to police to demonstrate someone is in the country legally -- an Arizona driver's license or state ID card, tribal membership card or any other U.S. government ID that is issued only to legal residents.

Full text: Arizona's law giving local police immigration enforcement powers is likely to be struck down, most legal experts predict, now that the Obama administration has gone to court asserting that it conflicts with federal law.
They cite the longstanding principle that the federal government has exclusive control over immigration and that "no state can add or take away" from the policy set in Washington.
However, they caution that one large uncertainty is that the current Supreme Court has not ruled directly on such a state-federal clash over immigration.
Traditionally, the federal government's view carries extra weight in immigration disputes.
"It's one thing for MALDEF (Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund) or the ACLU to say this (Arizona law) interferes with federal policy. It is quite a different thing when the federal government goes to court and says it," said Jack Chin, a University of Arizona law professor. "The clear rule has been that states do not have the power to regulate immigration."
Arizona's leaders have said their law does not conflict with federal immigration policy. However, the Justice Department argued that the state exceeded its authority by making it a state crime for an illegal immigrant to apply for a job or to be caught without immigration papers.
Such "unlawful presence" is a civil violation, not a federal crime, and thus the state cannot make this immigration violation a crime, the department argued.
The administration also asserted that the federal policy is to target "dangerous aliens" such as violent criminals, fugitives and gang members, rather than to arrest and deport the millions of illegal immigrants in the U.S.
"There is a tension between the federal policy and the state of Arizona," said Washington lawyer Paul Virtue, former general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, an agency that no longer exists. "The state is setting different priorities and different penalties."
The Constitution authorizes Congress to set a "uniform rule of naturalization" and says the laws of the United States are the "supreme law of the land." The Justice Department cites this basic provision in arguing why the Arizona law should be declared "invalid, null and void."
In one case, the Supreme Court in 1941 threw out a Pennsylvania law that required immigrants to carry an "alien identification card." The justices ruled that the state had no such authority.
In recent years, some states and cities have sought to enforce restrictions on illegal immigrants on the basis that the federal government had failed to enforce the existing laws.
Most of those efforts have run aground, however. A federal judge in Los Angeles blocked California's Proposition 187 from taking effect in 1994 and ruled the measure, which tried to deny illegal immigrants public health care, education or welfare, invalid in 1997 on the grounds that it regulated immigration. The state dropped its appeal before the case was decided by an appellate court. Three years ago, a federal judge blocked Hazleton, Pa., from prohibiting illegal immigrants from renting housing.
Still, some legal experts think the Supreme Court may be ready to reconsider the issue.
"This is an unsettled area of constitutional jurisprudence. The last major pronouncement on the question was against a completely different landscape," said Temple University law professor Peter Spiro. The justices "may be willing to cut (states) some slack in the face of Washington's now persistent failure to deal with immigration reform."
On June 28, the high court announced it will hear a separate Arizona immigration case in the fall. The Arizona Legislature voted to take away the business licenses of employers who continue to knowingly hire illegal workers. To the surprise of many, a federal district judge and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that law, citing a provision in a 1996 law passed by Congress.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce appealed and won the backing of the Obama administration. The court then voted to hear the case.
The court also may view more favorably the Arizona law giving police more arrest authority.
"It wouldn't surprise me that five members of the court would think that the mere enforcement of immigration law does not change immigration law," said John Eastman, former dean of the Chapman University School of Law.
Arizona's lawyers say their law, due to take effect July 29, would not conflict with federal law because it authorizes police during a lawful stop to question a person when there is a "reasonable suspicion" he or she is here illegally.
If a judge blocks the measure from taking effect, the state can immediately appeal to the 9th Circuit Court. The state may also seek a quick appeal to the Supreme Court if that fails.

Long dominated by immigrant communities from Latin America and East Asia, Sunset Park in Brooklyn is slowly becoming home to non-immigrants. "I like to joke that my newest immigrants come from Manhattan," says Jeremy Laufer, district manager of Community Board 7, which covers Sunset Park and Windsor Terrace. The main appeal of the neighborhood: housing prices lower than those in Manhattan and in nearby neighborhoods like Park Slope.
Sunset Park is named for the park at its heart, which has sweeping views of the Statue of Liberty, the Manhattan skyline, Staten Island and New Jersey. According to the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, the area was first developed in the 19th century when Irish and Scandinavian immigrants settled there.
The Bush Terminal Docks on the Brooklyn waterfront employed more than 25,000 people at its peak and was a hub of warehousing and manufacturing for the U.S. The five-million-square-foot Brooklyn Army Terminal, opened in 1919, was a military depot and supply base in use through the early 1970s.
By the 1950s, Latino groups began to move in, and by the 1980s, a significant Asian population began to grow, Mr. Laufer says. Today, the main immigrant groups are from Mexico, South America and Puerto Rico, as well as China. While Latino bodegas and other businesses dominate Fourth Avenue, Eighth Avenue is home to Brooklyn's own Chinatown. Many Asian immigrants commute to work in Manhattan's busier, tourist-clogged counterpart but choose to live in Sunset Park, an easy connection on the N train, because it's less crowded, Mr. Laufer says.
New condominiums are popping up among older brownstone, limestone and clapboard town houses.
Parks: Sunset Park has a pool that opened in 1936 as well as walkways, a volleyball court and a recreation center with a library, a dance room and a workout room. Prospect Park and Green-Wood Cemetery, where notables like Leonard Bernstein, Boss Tweed, Louis Comfort Tiffany and Horace Greeley are buried, are also nearby.
Dining: Try bubble tea at TenRen's Tea & Ginseng Co., and dim sum at King Star Restaurant. Ba Xuyen offers Vietnamese sandwiches, while Nyonya has Malaysian cuisine. New Belachan Restaurant, specializing in sushi, just opened. Also stop by the Hong Kong Supermarket for Asian groceries, fresh seafood, vegetables and fruits.
Schools: Sunset Park is in District 15 with schools including P.S. 001 the Bergen, where there is a gifted program for students in kindergarten through 5th grade and extracurricular activities include a formal conflict-resolution program. The school also has partnerships with the Brooklyn Museum and the Center for Family Life.
Sunset Park High School has a hospital outreach partnership with Lutheran Medical Center and additional affiliations with community organizations.

Abstract: [...] they were years when I was treated with respect by my employer; years when I or my union representative sat down at the table with my bosses to determine working conditions and benefits; years when the company followed and obeyed labor laws and regulations. Today, without a union contract, farmworkers are lucky to get minimum wage, with no benefits, no insurance, no enforcement of labor laws that protect other American workers.

Full text: Arturo Rodriguez, president of the United Farm Workers of America, appeared on "The Colbert Report" on Thursday to invite Americans of all races and backgrounds to participate in the farm labor that feeds our nation. The UFW, Rodriguez said, only partly tongue in cheek, is ready to welcome folks who want to put an end to the need for foreign nationals to pick our crops.
Colbert volunteered; the audience chortled. But it shouldn't have been all that funny. The truth is, if the very thought of doing farm work didn't make so many Americans laugh, we'd all be better off.
I worked in the fields for more than a dozen years in the 1970s and 1980s, picking and packing grapes at Almaden Vineyards, at Tenneco Farming Co. and at David Freedman Co. in the Coachella Valley, all under contract with the UFW. Those were some of the best years of my life. They did not make me rich, or even middle class. But they were years when I was treated with respect by my employer; years when I or my union representative sat down at the table with my bosses to determine working conditions and benefits; years when the company followed and obeyed labor laws and regulations.
True, the sun was just as hot under a union contract as without one. There were still dust and spiders and, every now and then, a snake. But each little packing table had a shade umbrella or roof, and we pickers were mostly up under the vines, filling our boxes with fresh grapes. The crews were their own little societies, with soloists and family groups; raucous political discussions going on; flirting among the young folks; wonderful homemade tortillas and food at break time. And at the end of the day I could be proud of the 400 pounds or more of grapes I had picked and packed at their peak. In addition to my wages, I would be taking home the sweetest grapes (too ripe to ship!) for my family.
David Freedman Co. was led by Lionel Steinberg and his son, William (known by the workers with real respect and affection as Billy). As a teenager, Billy traveled the migrant trail from Coachella to Fresno County with one of the worker families to learn the trade; the older Filipino men taught him the art of vineyard pruning. By the time I began working there, he was running the field operations of the company while his dad concentrated on sales. They negotiated in good faith with the workers, they made a living and so did we, and for almost 20 years they offered an alternative to factory farming as a way to put food on our tables.
Though Freedman was not totally organic, a wide variety of chemicals were banned under the union contract, and other chemicals were carefully regulated -- a tremendous benefit for workers and consumers. By 1981, the contract provided about double minimum wage, at which point we were probably the best-compensated grape pickers in the world. We had paid holidays, and for high-seniority workers, two weeks' paid vacation; disability and unemployment insurance; family medical insurance (with 60 hours of work or more in a month); even a modest pension plan. The Coachella Valley had a UFW medical clinic for the workers and their families, and a legal aid center to help with taxes, Social Security and other issues.
Sadly, only one UFW contract remains in the Coachella Valley, and wages and benefits are not as generous as they were 25 years ago. Today, without a union contract, farmworkers are lucky to get minimum wage, with no benefits, no insurance, no enforcement of labor laws that protect other American workers. Agriculture is ranked among the three most hazardous occupations in the nation. Well-fed politicians heap scorn on undocumented workers, including much of today's farm labor force, and de-fund the most minimal programs that might help them. Calls for arresting and deporting 11 million illegal immigrants are not a solution for a broken system. It's just "biting the hand that feeds."
Of course, farm labor will never be for everyone. But neither should it be a laughable prospect. It should be honored work, with decent wages and working conditions. Our civilization is possible because someone plants the seeds, prunes the vines and picks and packs the fruit and vegetables that feed us. The legacy of David Freedman Co. under the UFW contract is one all Americans can be proud of. It is proof that U.S. agriculture does not have to be based on the labor of an underclass denied the rights and benefits of other workers.

Full text: A coach who cared
Re "Don Coryell, 1924 - 2010," Obituary, July 2
The loss of Don Coryell reminds me what coaching should be about. I had the privilege of working with Coryell, first as sports editor of the student newspaper at San Diego State, then as assistant sports information director there, and finally as a newspaper reporter.
Like John Wooden, Coryell coached winning teams and was innovative. But what I learned from Don was how to deal with people. He treated each of his players, and everyone he came in contact with, with the utmost respect. He gave you 100% of his attention and was genuinely concerned about your success, on and off the field. He made you feel special and important, and vital to the team's success.
With this approach, Coryell turned out not only winning teams but, more important, winning people. It's an injustice that he isn't enshrined in the pro football Hall of Fame.

Soccer isn'tfor them
Re "When will the U.S. grasp soccer?" Opinion, July 4
The answer to Ariel Dorfman's rhetorical question is: never.
And it's not a function of "anti-immigrant nativists" or American arrogance. The answer is perfectly clear. Though playing soccer might be fun, watching it on television is deadly dull. The officiating is arbitrary and capricious, and years appear to go by between goals.
I've watched some of this year's World Cup "action" over the last few weeks, but once the series ends, I'll go back to a more exciting spectator sport: listening to golf on the radio.
Jerry Wright
Los Angeles
::
Every four years, during the World Cup, the U.S. gets ridiculed for not living and dying for soccer.
The reason for this is easily explained: baseball, basketball, football and hockey -- four sports that display more skill and have more action. Not to mention actual scoring.
The real question is, why doesn't the rest of the world get the incredible sports of baseball, basketball, football and hockey?

The howling over coyotes
Re "Crusading against predatory coyotes," July 6
The article says that experts think the growing daytime attacks are due to "human complacency."
I'm surprised these experts didn't say anything about the fact that we've overrun the coyotes' territory. Perhaps the coyotes are getting desperate for food because we continue to destroy their habitat.
Though I certainly don't want to see people lose precious pets, I wish we would look to the long term and leave the nonhuman creatures living and hunting space.
Louise Linden
Beverly Hills
::
The most important thing Thousand Oaks-area residents can do to protect their animal companions from coyotes is to keep them indoors, allowing them outside only on a leash or in a fenced-in area, under supervision.
Attacks by predators aren't the only dangers our animal companions face outdoors. Every day, animals are poisoned, used for target practice and worse after being left outside alone, even for just a few minutes. Trying to eliminate coyotes by trapping, shooting or poisoning them is cruel and can harm cats and dogs who step into a trap, swallow poison or take a bullet intended for a coyote. It's also ineffective because more coyotes will simply move in to fill the void. Preventing coyotes from frequenting an area in the first place by removing food sources and hiding places is more humane and effective than resorting to violence.

Check out our libraries
Re "The public library blues," Opinion, July 6
Marilyn Johnson's message is especially relevant to California.
In the 2009 America's Most Literate Cities report, six California cities placed in the bottom seven places in public library quality: Bakersfield (69th), Los Angeles (70th), Anaheim (71st), Sacramento (72nd), Stockton (74th) and Santa Ana (75th).
California also has the worst-supported school libraries in the country, in terms of both holdings and staffing.
Study after study shows that library quality is related to higher scores on reading tests. It is therefore not surprising that California children do poorly on reading tests: Children get better in reading by reading a lot, and they read more when they have access to books.
Let's divert some of the huge sums spent on testing to funding libraries. Let's invest in promoting learning, not just measuring it.

Every mansion has its price
Re "The billionaire next door," July 6
The Times article describing the way-over-the-top construction of Patrick Soon-Shiong's giant residence brings to mind a phrase William Bendix used to regularly say in the early TV sitcom "Life of Riley": "What a revoltin' development this is!"
Christine Sanchez
Brentwood
::
Not long ago, less than 10 minutes from the "billionaire next door's" construction site was another sizable property under construction. It is now a state-of-the-art medical center, St. John's Health Center, and Soon-Shiong takes credit as its largest benefactor.
The Times' myopic view offers a less-than-candid perspective of a true philanthropist.
Zorik Mooradian
Tarzana
::
As someone who once had an extended business meeting with Dr. Soon-Shiong's wife more than several years ago -- before he was known as the richest man in L.A. -- I left with no doubt about her family and her sincere humanity and uprightness. I also saw how much they valued their privacy. Your front-page story must be devastating to them.
Becoming rich and famous has its price. As a public relations professional, I can attest that those who earn their way into the spotlight at the top of the pyramid discover that, sadly and ironically, there is one precious commodity they can no longer afford to buy: privacy.

Sprucing uparound USC
Re "USC wants its own Westwood Village," July 3
You have to applaud USC for wanting to take control of its surroundings. An upgrade of University Village is a moral obligation, and expanding the housing will help students avoid the slumlord experience that currently exists in many of the off-campus options.
Looking at the University of Pennsylvania as an example is smart, because West Philly is similar to the USC area in safety and criminal element. Thanks to USC public safety, the LAPD, the California Highway Patrol and the security guards who patrol the area, USC is as safe as a USC parent like me could hope for.
USC, however, would be remiss to not research the origins of the once-fresh and progressive University Village and why it came to its current rundown condition. This new development is a great idea, but the university should avoid the mistakes of the past.

This dump won't go away
Re "Indian tribe opposes an adjacent landfill," July 5
Thank you for a fine article on the Gregory Canyon dump in northern San Diego County. I have been fighting this monstrous project for 22 years.
If Nancy Chase, lobbyist for the developers, is "appalled" by the casino on the Pala reservation, I too am appalled at the insensitivity shown by the comment that the dump will only be a "blip in time" for these Native Americans. Is the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico also just a "blip in time," since the oceans have existed since time immemorial?
Blip in time indeed! Destruction is destruction, no matter how long it lasts.

A Blue Line train was misdirected onto the Orange Line for the second time in two weeks Friday morning after a Metro worker set the tracks incorrectly, according to a Metro official.
The train was misrouted onto the Orange Line at Stadium-Armory and had to reverse to where the switches are and then continue along the Blue Line, according to Metro spokesman Steven Taubenkibel.
Taubenkibel said that there was no danger of a collision but that the incident was reported to the Tri-State Oversight Commission, which oversees safety at Metro. Passengers experienced a nine-minute delay.
The maintenance worker responsible for misrouting the train, who has worked for Metro for 10 years, will undergo routine drug and alcohol testing, Taubenkibel said.
Last week, a Blue Line train took a wrong turn after a controller manually sent it to New Carrollton instead of Largo.
Taubenkibel said Metro doesn't think that either incident was a safety issue.

The Department of Homeland Security will extend "temporary protected status" for citizens of El Salvador, which was due to expire Sept. 9, for 18 months until March 9, 2012, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced Friday.
TPS allows those who were in the United States at the time of a 2001 earthquake in El Salvador to legally reside and work in the United States. To maintain the status, beneficiaries must re-register before Sept. 7, 2010. An estimated 217,000 Salvadorans are eligible, including some of the estimated 500,000 Salvadoran immigrants who live in the D.C. area.
Forms are available online or by calling the toll-free USCIS Forms line, 800-870-3676, or the USCIS National Customer Service Center toll-free number, 800-375-5283.

VIRGINIA
A U.S. district judge in Alexandria sentenced a member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang to 27 years in prison Friday in connection with the 2009 slaying and robbery of a Northern Virginia pimp.
In April, Eris Ramon Arguera, 21, of Alexandria pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit robbery, extortion and use of a firearm during a crime of violence in connection with the slaying of Claros Luna.
According to authorities, Arguera and two other members of the gang, also known as MS-13, posed as prostitution customers and lured Luna and a prostitute to the 700 block of Manor Road in Alexandria on July 29, 2009.
Arguera, holding a handgun, met the prostitute in the apartment building's lobby and directed her back to the vehicle, where Luna was in the driver's seat, waiting. The three men then tried to rob Luna and the prostitute. Luna was shot during the attempt.

Montgomery County authorities are investigating the shooting death of an Alexandria man Thursday evening in Silver Spring.
Police say Joseph L. Kennedy Jr., 20, was killed about 7:40 in the 2300 block of Darrow Street. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene.
The circumstances of the shooting are being investigated, police said.
No one has been arrested or charged, authorities said, although police said they've identified a 21-year-old man, who remained at the scene, as the shooter.

A 19-year-old District man died in a double shooting in Southeast Washington early Friday, authorities said.
Stanley Dawson of Good Hope Road was found shot about 12:18 a.m. in the 3500 block of 19th Street SE. A second victim, who was wounded, was found on Stanton Road.

A former teacher at Sidwell Friends School has pleaded guilty to one count of child sex abuse, one of his attorneys said.
Robert A. "Pete" Peterson, a former social studies teacher at the school, entered the plea Thursday in Montgomery County Circuit Court, said Barry Helfand, who has represented him with David Martella.
Helfand said Friday that Peterson will be required to register, and fulfill other conditions, but that with the approval of the state and the victim's family no jail time will be imposed.
The Capital Criterium bike race will close some streets and draw lots of cycling and pedestrian traffic to the downtown area along Pennsylvania Avenue NW on Sunday. The course is along Pennsylvania Avenue between Ninth and 13th streets, up to F Street.
The event begins at 8 a.m. and should be over by about 3:30 p.m., but some streets will be closed as early as 3 a.m. for setup and won't reopen until 5 p.m. The Web site has a list of affected streets.

The Department of Transportation's forestry division is asking residents to help water some of the trees on the city's streets.
"Summer heat and normal urban pressures create intense stress for street trees," John Thomas, the District's chief forester, said in a statement.
City crews are watering 3,500 trees they planted this year, he said, but the city is asking residents and business owners "to help water street trees close to their homes and offices."
The Urban Forestry Administration provides free watering devices to participants in its Canopy Keepers program. More information is available on DDOT's Web site at ddot.dc.gov; click on the trees icon.

A National Park Service project to repair the 35-foot wall alongside Meridian Hill Park will partially close a portion of 16th Street NW starting next week.
The travel lanes will shift, parking on the southbound side across from the 600-foot-long work zone will be eliminated and the sidewalk on the east side of 16th Street, near the park, will be closed from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. Repairs on the 96-year-old wall are scheduled to take about three months. Although four traffic lanes will remain open at all times, these temporary measures are likely to slow car and bus commuting on this important north-south route.
Pedestrians will be directed to cross to the west side of W and Euclid streets during the work hours, and drivers also will be moved to the west, away from the wall.

Full text: Long dominated by immigrant communities from Latin America and East Asia, Sunset Park in Brooklyn is slowly becoming home to non-immigrants. "I like to joke that my newest immigrants come from Manhattan," says Jeremy Laufer, district manager of Community Board 7, which covers Sunset Park and Windsor Terrace. The main appeal of the neighborhood: housing prices lower than those in Manhattan and in nearby neighborhoods like Park Slope.
Sunset Park is named for the park at its heart, which has sweeping views of the Statue of Liberty, the Manhattan skyline, Staten Island and New Jersey. According to the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, the area was first developed in the 19th century when Irish and Scandinavian immigrants settled there.
The Bush Terminal Docks on the Brooklyn waterfront employed more than 25,000 people at its peak and was a hub of warehousing and manufacturing for the U.S. The five-million-square-foot Brooklyn Army Terminal, opened in 1919, was a military depot and supply base in use through the early 1970s.
By the 1950s, Latino groups began to move in, and by the 1980s, a significant Asian population began to grow, Mr. Laufer says. Today, the main immigrant groups are from Mexico, South America and Puerto Rico, as well as China. While Latino bodegas and other businesses dominate Fourth Avenue, Eighth Avenue is home to Brooklyn's own Chinatown. Many Asian immigrants commute to work in Manhattan's busier, tourist-clogged counterpart but choose to live in Sunset Park, an easy connection on the N train, because it's less crowded, Mr. Laufer says.
New condominiums are popping up among older brownstone, limestone and clapboard town houses.
Parks: Sunset Park has a pool that opened in 1936 as well as walkways, a volleyball court and a recreation center with a library, a dance room and a workout room. Prospect Park and Green-Wood Cemetery, where notables like Leonard Bernstein, Boss Tweed, Louis Comfort Tiffany and Horace Greeley are buried, are also nearby.
Dining: Try bubble tea at TenRen's Tea & Ginseng Co., and dim sum at King Star Restaurant. Ba Xuyen offers Vietnamese sandwiches, while Nyonya has Malaysian cuisine. New Belachan Restaurant, specializing in sushi, just opened. Also stop by the Hong Kong Supermarket for Asian groceries, fresh seafood, vegetables and fruits.
Schools: Sunset Park is in District 15 with schools including P.S. 001 the Bergen, where there is a gifted program for students in kindergarten through 5th grade and extracurricular activities include a formal conflict-resolution program. The school also has partnerships with the Brooklyn Museum and the Center for Family Life.
Sunset Park High School has a hospital outreach partnership with Lutheran Medical Center and additional affiliations with community organizations.

BOSTON--Governors hamstrung by the sluggish economic rebound in their states and bound to balance their own budgets are pressing anew for Washington to step up with more help, even if it means adding to the nation's red ink.
Republicans and Democrats alike wrestled Saturday at the National Governors Association meeting in Boston with how to capitalize on a fledgling rebound as they talked dollars and sense at their summer meeting just days into a new budget year and as the economy shapes dozens of gubernatorial races across the country.
Seperately, immigrant advocates and their allies were protesting Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer who was at the meeting.
A coalition of immigrant groups bused in advocates from around the East Coast for a rally to protest Arizona's immigration law, recently signed by Gov. Brewer.
Protesters in Copley Square said Gov. Brewer was a bigot and called for the end of what they said was "racist deportation.'' They later marched to a hotel where she was attending the annual governors meeting.
The Arizona law, which is facing a U.S. Justice Department challenge, requires police to question people about their immigration status while enforcing other laws if there is reason to suspect someone is in the country illegally.
Gov. Brewer has said Arizona had to act because the federal government wasn't doing enough border enforcement.
In regard to the economy, "All states still are facing tough fiscal situations even though I do believe we're in recovery,'' said West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who's taking over as chairman of the NGA.
Added Gov. Jim Douglas, R-Vt., the outgoing chairman: "Governors have done what is necessary to get through this'' repeatedly cutting budgets, restructuring government, laying off workers and draining rainy day funds.
But both men said states can't continue to climb out of the recession alone, and a majority of governors renewed their bipartisan appeal for Congress to pass stalled jobs legislation that includes billions of dollars in aid to states.
Just days before the new budget year began July 1, the House and Senate failed to complete legislation that would have extended, through June 2011, important parts of the federal stimulus program enacted last year to provide unemployment insurance and help offset recession-driven cuts to education, health care and public safety.
The measure offered $35.5 billion for unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless and $16 billion for Medicaid, the public health care program for the poor. It also would have added an estimated $33 billion to the deficit.
Even so, several Democratic and Republican governors suggested in interviews and during panel discussions that the short-term gain was worth the long-term pain.
``We need more help from Washington to protect against job cuts and health care cuts,'' Gov. Pat Quinn, D., Ill. "If we don't do that, we're following Herbert Hoover economics.''
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat facing a tough re-election fight, said that without Washington's assistance, "the danger of a double-dip recession is greater.'' Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, called for "a little less talk and a lot more action'' from Washington.
But Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal, also a Democrat, said money from Washington wasn't the answer. ``Each of us has to figure out a way to pare back the public's expectation of what government's going to pay for.'' Gov. Bob McDonnell, R., Va., said he worried about deficit spending. "There's a growing sentiment among citizens of this country is the rate of growth is unsustainable.''
Governors headed to Boston for the weekend ready to share ideas on a range of issues, from health care to alternative energy to education. But the economy--and how to capitalize on signs of recovery--dominated the discussions.
States have suffered for two straight years as collections from sales, income and property taxes came in lower than expected when people stopped spending money, lost their jobs and the housing market tanked. Governors also saw demand for state services soar. While the federal government reports signs of economic growth, recovery is slower in the states. A report last month by the NGA and the National Association of State Budget Officers found that state fiscal conditions continue to deteriorate.
States are expected to have faced $296.6 billion in shortfalls between the 2009 and 2012 budget years, and the report found that the new budget year will be just as challenging despite the expectation of modest increases in tax collections.
That means governors will have to cut spending or raise taxes to make up for expected budget gaps, steps certain to slow the economic recovery further. There are political realities to the states' economic challenges.
This fall, 37 states will elect governors; a majority of those races already are competitive. The economy is dominating contests across the country, and Democrats are on defense in a slew of economically struggling states.
But Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, chairman of the committee trying to elect Democrats, said Democrats have a good chance of prevailing in states such as California and Florida, where they have focused on job creation and the middle class, while Republicans have engaged in bitter primary battles over gay marriage, immigration and other issues.
"They're making the contrast pretty easy,'' he said. Among the most vulnerable Democrats is Iowa Gov. Chet Culver, who plans to spend the next four months telling voters that "there are some bright spots, and beyond the horizon it's really bright because we're weathering this economic storm.''
Still, he said he'd welcome money from Washington to ensure the recovery continues.

Full text: Russia deported three former KGB officers and a nuclear scientist accused of betrayal, exchanging them Friday in Vienna for 10 agents arrested in the U.S. and completing a whirlwind spy swap that was one of the largest since the Cold War.
The trade gave the U.S. access to two former Russian intelligence colonels who had been convicted in their country of compromising dozens of Soviet-era and Russian agents in the West. Moscow gained a swift end to a scandal in which the FBI after years of surveillance busted a network of deep-cover "sleeper" agents who, U.S. officials said, had failed to gain access to state secrets.
By agreeing to the swap just 12 days after those arrests, both sides avoided a series of drawn-out U.S. spy trials that would have strained an improving relationship that the two countries' presidents are eager to maintain.
"It's the best example of President Obama's policy to reset relations," said Nikolai Zlobin, a Russia specialist at the World Security Institute in Washington, an independent think tank. "Reset works."
The carefully synchronized exchange took place after two special planes, one from New York and one from Moscow, landed at Vienna's airport within minutes of each other and parked nose-to-tail on a remote section of the tarmac, news agencies reported. Shuttled by a small bus, the two groups of deportees traded places and the planes took off.
The swap was reminiscent of the Cold War, when Vienna, the capital of neutral Austria, was a favored venue for diplomatic intrigue.
The hand-off completed a swap first contemplated at an Oval Office meeting presided over by President Barack Obama on Friday, June 11, according to a White House official. At the meeting, officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Justice Department and Central Intelligence Agency described the work of the Russian agents.
That date was more than two weeks before the spies were arrested but only two days after the U.N. Security Council approved what the administration calls the toughest sanctions against Iran over its nuclear enrichment program. Winning Moscow's approval for sanctions was a major diplomatic victory for Washington.
White House officials, who first were briefed about the investigation in February, said they discussed plans to make arrests to shut down the program, dubbed the "illegals," operated by the Russian SVR foreign intelligence agency. They also discussed what moves, including a swap, the U.S. could make to limit any diplomatic fallout.
A White House official said Friday that a major concern for U.S. officials over the last few weeks was to "ensure this was not going to have a negative impact on the strategic relationship we have with Russia."
The FBI carried out the arrests on June 27. On Thursday, all 10 Russian agents pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiring to act as illegal foreign agents and agreed to be expelled from the U.S. Prosecutors with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office initially charged 11 people, but one jumped bail in Cyprus after his arrest there and is believed to be in Russia.
The U.S. Justice Department announced the completion of the trade after the planes touched down in Moscow and Britain's RAF Brize Norton air base in southern England. Two of the four Russians were dropped off at the air base before the plane headed for the United States, the Associated Press reported.
After landing at Moscow's Domodedovo airport in the late afternoon, the 10 agents deported from the U.S. were whisked away by police-escorted caravan to an undisclosed location, Russian media reported.
White House officials said the minor children of the alleged Russian agents are on their way or in the process of leaving for Russia to join their parents.
The FBI had watched the sleeper network for years as its members blended into American life. It did not accuse them of espionage; their work over a decade seemed to be of limited value, although the extent of information they passed on is not known.
By contrast, at least two of the Russians deported by Moscow are believed to have caused significant damage to Moscow's intelligence networks.
Some Russian commentators said the deal was highly favorable to the U.S. "They exchanged 10 fools for four smart men," said Vladimir Volkov, a former lawyer for Gennady Vasilenko, one of those deported from Russia.
The most prominent spy deported by Moscow was Alexander Zaporozhsky, a decorated former KGB colonel. He is suspected of exposing information that helped lead to the arrests of Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames, two of the most damaging spies ever caught in the West.
He had retired in 1997 and moved with his family to the Washington area, describing himself as an immigrant. In 2001 he was lured to Moscow for what his wife thought was a KGB reunion and arrested upon arrival. He was sentenced in 2003 to 18 years in prison for espionage on behalf of the U.S.
Sergei Skripal, another former KGB colonel, had also retired by the time he was arrested in 2004 on charges of having spied for the British Secret Intelligence Service starting in the late 1990s. He was accused of having exposed the identities of dozens of his former colleagues operating under cover in Europe. He began a 13-year sentence in 2006 and was reported in poor health.
The case of Igor Sutyagin, the nuclear scientist, was different. The U.S. government considered him a victim of human rights abuse rather than a spy.
Arrested in 1999, he was one of the most prominent in a series of academics put on trial in Russia for espionage at a time when the FSB, the main successor to the KGB, was trying to reassert itself under Vladimir Putin. Human rights activists said Mr. Putin, who became president in 2000 and is now prime minister, was creating a spy mania.
Mr. Sutyagin, working as an arms researcher for the U.S.A. and Canada Institute, a respected Moscow think tank, was accused of passing information on nuclear submarines and other weapons to a British company that Russia claimed was a CIA cover. He asserted his innocence, but a judge refused to allow defense lawyers to present evidence that the information he handled was not secret. He was convicted in 2004 and sentenced to 15 years in prison.
The fourth man expelled by Moscow, Mr. Vasilenko, is something of a mystery. He had been in prison since 2005 on a weapons possession charge that, his lawyer believes, had nothing to do with an espionage career ended years earlier. His value to the United States was not as clear as that of the former KGB colonels.
Mr. Vasilenko served as a KGB agent in Washington from 1976 to 1981. He was arrested in Cuba in 1988, detained in Moscow for six months and questioned about his friendship with a CIA counterpart, Jack Platt. Mr. Vasilenko was expelled from the KGB but not charged with espionage.
Mr. Vasilenko later told Alexander Koplapkidi and Dmitry Prokhorov, Russian authors of a book about espionage, he and Mr. Platt had become friends after trying for years to recruit each other as a double agent.
According to the authors, it was Hanssen, the FBI counterintelligence agent, who told his Kremlin handlers that Mr. Vasilenko was a spy. Mr. Hanssen was arrested on espionage charges in 2001.

Working the field; Afghan Cup in Va. is fertile ground for U.S. military to recruit Dari, Pashto speakers

Abstract: [...] in the past few years, the tournament has taken on a new role as a fertile field for the government's urgent quest to recruit speakers of Dari and Pashto, Afghanistan's two official languages. "[...] what are you going to do with it if you're dead -- if you get blown up before coming home?" With a minuscule pool of U.S. citizens who speak Dari and Pashto, and even fewer willing to return to their war-torn native country, the Afghan Cup has become a recruiting gold mine.

Full text: The crowd in Prince William County, gathered for the biggest Afghan sporting event in North America, erupted in a roar in Dari, Pashto and English. But this weekend's Afghan Cup is no mere game.
The soccer pitch in Woodbridge was plastered with ads from companies -- backed by more than $1.3 billion in government contracts -- looking to sign up U.S. citizens to make more than $200,000 a year working as Dari and Pashto interpreters in Afghanistan. One company, SOS International, handed out 500 T-shirts that read, in Pashto: "If you can read this, we might have a job for you." Several teams wore the names and logos of recruiting companies on their uniforms.
The soccer contest that plays out on Northern Virginia fields for three days every July, drawing thousands of Afghan Americans, is full of intense rivalries among 12 teams from immigrant communities in California, New York, New Jersey, Toronto and Virginia. But in the past few years, the tournament has taken on a new role as a fertile field for the government's urgent quest to recruit speakers of Dari and Pashto, Afghanistan's two official languages.
"These are golden, cherished people," said Dave Slovina, vice president of recruiting for Mission Essential Personnel, an Ohio-based contractor that signed up 45 interpreters at the tourney two years ago. "Our job is to make field trips into their communities. We shake hands. We press flesh. We go to their restaurants and stores. We build trust."
That can be a tough task. In the shadow of one recruiter's tent, Nisar Paraza cheered for Ariana, a Fairfax City-based team named after an ancient Afghan empire. But as he watched the game, Paraza quietly tore a recruitment information card into tiny pieces, letting them fall into the dirt. "$200,000 is a lot of money," he said. "But what are you going to do with it if you're dead -- if you get blown up before coming home?"
With a minuscule pool of U.S. citizens who speak Dari and Pashto, and even fewer willing to return to their war-torn native country, the Afghan Cup has become a recruiting gold mine. The torrent of attention from deep-pocketed recruiters has boosted a tournament once funded largely by kebab restaurants and a local mosque. The finals are played at the massive Maryland SoccerPlex in Germantown. And there's a slick concert, thanks in part to the largesse of federal recruiters. Even the $1,000 tab each team pays to play is often picked up by contractors.
"The fact is, we wouldn't be able to have an Afghan Cup without these contractors coming in and sponsoring us," said Omar Bashir, who coaches Ariana.
Mission Essential Personnel, which has received contracts worth more than $1.3 billion from the U.S. Army to recruit Pashto and Dari interpreters, estimates that only 7,760 U.S. citizens speak Pashto. But only 2,250, they estimate, could qualify for a security clearance. Finding those Americans has become one of the most lucrative ventures in the nine-year-old war in Afghanistan. And since the war's expansion, including President Obama's addition of tens of thousands of troops last year, "it's been a full, all-out sprint" to find interpreters, Slovina said.
In 2004, Wahid Panjshiri, a fixture on the bleachers this weekend, put aside his soccer career with Ariana and his job as a cabdriver at Dulles airport to work as an interpreter in the country of his birth.
Recruited by Worldwide Language Resources, Panjshiri was told what most prospective interpreters are told: You'll be with an Army unit, but we don't know what you will do or where you will do it. You will divide your time among U.S. military bases and combat zones.
With so few U.S. citizens willing and able to serve as interpreters, questions have been raised about whether contractors are settling for men who lack the physical capacity for the job. The average age range of Mission Essential recruits is 47 to 65, according to the company. Interpreters are assigned to U.S. Army units and given about three weeks of training on U.S. bases before deploying.
"I've met guys off the planes and have immediately sent them back because they weren't in the proper physical shape," Gunnery Sgt. James Spangler, who is in charge of linguists at Camp Leatherneck in Helmand province, told the Associated Press last year. "They were too old. They couldn't breathe. They complained about heart problems."
After three weeks of training at Fort Benning, Ga., Panjshiri boarded a plane to Kabul. "It seemed like a good idea at the time -- see my country, make some money," he said.
But Panjshiri only made it through the first six months before his family starting pleading for him to return. Then he was back in Virginia. Back in time for the Afghan Cup. Back in time to watch recruiters on the sidelines, looking for a new crop of interpreters.
When the first wave of emigrants fled Afghanistan to Northern Virginia during the Soviet occupation of the late 1970s and early 1980s, they quickly organized a soccer league that drew Afghan lawyers-turned-taxi drivers, exiled activists and former members of the Afghan national team.
Now, with an Afghan community of more than 25,000 in the area, the star players are the sons of immigrants -- high school and college players who yell commands on the field in unaccented English and Dari.
For this generation of players, the league is one of the few connections to the Afghan community. "At 12 and 13 years old, I didn't think of myself as Afghan," said Bashir, the coach. "On the field, you start to feel more a part of the culture. And you learn the language again."
In 2001, the military began to recruit U.S. citizens who speak fluent Dari and Pashto to work in Iraq and Afghanistan; the emphasis on citizens was important because they could acquire advanced security clearances not available to noncitizens. The military does hire Afghan nationals to work as conduits between the Army and local populations, but because they cannot handle security-sensitive documents, they are paid about one-fifteenth of what American translators earn.
"Wages are typically set based on the market and the number of available people qualified to meet contract requirements," said MyRon Young, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command.
The Army contracted the recruitment effort to a handful of companies, in some cases paying recruiters more than $256,000 for each interpreter they signed up, according to a Government Accountability Office report. Most U.S. citizen interpreters make between $175,000 and $200,000 for one year in Afghanistan. Those who refer a recruit to a contractor receive up to a $4,500 finder's fee.
The work is dangerous, and interpreters such as Panjshiri say that Afghans accompanying U.S. units are marked men. Thirty of Mission Essential's interpreters, all of them Afghan nationals, have been killed since 2004, according to the company.
"We're targets. They see us -- Afghans helping the Americans -- and right away they want to kill us," Panjshiri said.
Slovina said Mission Essential's recruits are not targets in Afghanistan. "I just haven't come across linguists who were targeted because they're with the U.S. military," the recruiter said.
"The military unit is going to protect them just as much as they're going to protect the unit."
Despite the danger, with so few potential recruits and so much money at stake, the competition for Afghan Americans is palpable in Woodbridge, where several recruiters work the same sidelines. Mission Essential's recruiters hand out fliers with images of Afghan and U.S. flags and a tagline that reads, "$10,000 completion payment after 15 days!"
Zarghoona Noory worked the crowd for Veritiss, a Reston-based recruiter, trying to lure soccer fans with a generous starting salary and benefits.
But when she stepped away from her company's tent, Noory told of her husband, who has worked as an interpreter in Afghanistan for 18 months. "He never comes home," she said. "I miss him."
Now her son, 19, is on his way to Kabul to work as an interpreter. "He's full of hot blood," she said. "I don't know if he's prepared."
Why do they go? Some, like Panjshiri, say it's to see the country they left 25 years ago.
Others, like Ibrahim Husseini, a midfielder on Fairfax-based Afghan United who will leave for work in Kabul shortly after the tournament, said he feels a sense of purpose.
"I'm going to help the effort," said Husseini, who moved from Kabul to Virginia when he was 18. "I want to help rebuild Afghanistan."
Many say it's simply a matter of money. "You're giving them the opportunity to make more money than they've ever seen," said Massoud Issa, a sweeper on Ariana. "Of course they're going to jump on it."
The opportunity is broadcast everywhere -- at the Afghan Cup, but also on Afghan-American computer message boards and on Ariana TV, the satellite channel watched by thousands of Afghan families in Northern Virginia.
"Working as a linguist, and the financial support that it gives me, I'll be able to study and support my family at the same time," says a man identified only as Shafi in a Mission Essential spot now running on Ariana.
The tagline on Mission Essential's ads: "For America, For Afghanistan, For Me."

Full text: Washington has fallen in love with "comprehensive reform" -- legislation aimed at solving all aspects of a big problem in one dramatic and history-making move.
We saw it with health care. Now comprehensive financial regulatory reform has passed in the House, with a Senate vote expected soon. Up next may come energy legislation, following President Obama's Oval Office speech last month proclaiming a new "national mission" to wean America off fossil fuels. Comprehensive immigration reform, which failed back in 2007, waits in the wings, with the president calling for such an effort in a July 1 address. And a push for comprehensive fiscal reform will surely come on the heels of the recommendations this fall from Obama's deficit commission.
No doubt, the problems we face -- massive unemployment, a broken immigration system, a malfunctioning financial sector -- are monumental. But it does not follow that each complex, giant problem must be addressed by one complex, giant bill. If anything, history shows that piecemeal reforms are often more lasting than a legislative Big Bang.
Politicians are seduced by comprehensive reform because history tends to glorify presidents and legislators who pass big, definitive laws. Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky, for example, is celebrated for averting the Civil War for a decade by passing the Compromise of 1850, which temporarily resolved disputes over slavery in territories that the United States gained in the Mexican War. But the compromise came together only after a large omnibus bill failed; the legislation was broken up into five smaller bills, each of which passed separately.
President Franklin Roosevelt set a high standard for legislative accomplishments during the first 100 days of his administration in 1933, but here, too, popular memory can mislead. While some of FDR's signature achievements, such as the Glass-Steagall Act, passed during those early days of his presidency, his central accomplishment of that period -- the National Recovery Administration -- was a flop that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional in 1935. One of the most lasting achievements of the New Deal was Social Security, and it came in 1935, long past those 100 days.
And while President Lyndon Johnson is remembered for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it was the culmination of increasingly bold civil rights laws in 1957 and 1960 that chipped away at segregation before the final push shattered American apartheid.
Politicians and advocacy groups say they have no choice but to push for all-encompassing reforms because the alternative -- slow, incremental change -- is doomed to fail. On health care, for example, advocates of comprehensive reform said costs couldn't be contained unless the problem of increasing coverage was solved, too. Similarly, proponents of an immigration overhaul contend that you can't secure the borders without fixing the status of illegal immigrants already living here.
On any issue, it seems, the pieces are all so connected that it is impossible to solve one challenge without the rest. And time is never on your side, because the titanic struggle to pass any reform will be so bruising that, succeed or fail, shell-shocked lawmakers will shun the issue for years to come.
But there are three critical problems with comprehensive reform -- problems that a more methodical, step-by-step approach could help remedy.
First, large-scale reforms give excessive leverage to politicians and groups representing narrow interests. In the health-care battle, holdouts such as Sens. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) and Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) enjoyed disproportionate bargaining power precisely because so much was at stake. And during the push for immigration reform during the George W. Bush administration, business interests forced the last-minute addition of a provision for hundreds of thousands of new guest workers -- and helped doom the legislation by inspiring the opposition of organized labor.
In such cases, the outcome might have been different if Congress had passed a series of more limited bills, each with different sets of supporters, instead of creating one giant victim that a small group of representatives and senators could take hostage.
The second reason comprehensive reform is problematic is that it assumes an ability to foresee problems and fix them in advance -- a skill not necessarily found among mere mortals. The longer the time horizon, the greater the hubris of those who claim to be solving problems not just for today but for generations to come.
This overconfidence spans the political spectrum. For example, both liberal environmentalists and conservative deficit hawks rely on sophisticated models to predict dire threats decades away, whether a catastrophic rise in the Earth's temperature or unsustainable entitlement spending. In each case, even slight changes in the variables can make the remote future look either scary or benign. But when scholarship gives way to advocacy, possible problems generations out are often presented as all-but-certain disasters -- avoidable only by immediate action.
In reality, we have no idea what the global temperature or the budgetary climate will be like in 50 or 100 years. If the United States had adopted a comprehensive energy strategy in the early 1900s, for example, it would have been based on the assumption that known reserves of coal and oil would soon run out. No one could have foreseen the oil reserves of Texas, the Middle East, West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico (including the deep-sea reserves squandered by the BP disaster). We could not have imagined nuclear energy or techniques to reach enormous quantities of shale gas.
In the case of budgeting for entitlements, none of the designers of the Social Security system foresaw the rapid expansion of the U.S. population following the immigration reforms of the 1960s, which inevitably increased the number of people receiving benefits. When Alan Greenspan's commission sought to fix Social Security in the 1980s, it did not envision how the bubbles and busts of the 1990s and 2000s would reduce payroll tax revenues by annihilating jobs and reducing wages. Efforts to anticipate the medium-term future are necessary, but proposals to fix the problems of the remote future are dubious.
A third challenge is our tendency to define every issue as a problem with a potential and distinct solution. This comes naturally to policy wonks and bureaucrats, as well as politicians who like to brag about the reforms they're leading and the legislation they're passing. However, if their rationalism were informed by a sense of the tragic, and a sense of realism, they would understand that some challenges are not problems to be solved, but situations to be ameliorated or endured. Wisdom lies in knowing that there are some things -- such as irreducible levels of crime or terrorism, or environmental damage caused by other countries -- that we just have to live with.
Instead of striding boldly into the future, we should grope our way cautiously forward, ever ready to back up upon encountering an obstacle and always prepared to consider an alternative path if the road is blocked, or to abandon the effort and simply live with frustration if there is no way ahead. Instead of aspiring to achieve irrevocable, comprehensive reform by the second Monday of next month, let's consider reforms that are piecemeal and reversible if we discover they do not work.
Today's financial reformers would do well to remember that Franklin Roosevelt's administration dealt with financial regulation in numerous bills over several years. The 1933 Glass-Steagall Act was modified by the 1935 Banking Act; the Securities Act of 1933, which required public disclosure of corporate information to shareholders, was followed by the 1934 Securities Exchange Act, which created the Securities and Exchange Commission. So even during the Great Depression, financial regulations were assembled piece by piece, not all at once.
The same could go for immigration today. Although stronger enforcement at the border and in the workplace is probably a political necessity before any new attempts at legalizing the status of illegal immigrants can move forward, there are some other pieces to bite off short of a single, all-encompassing reform push. The backlog of green cards for legal immigrants can be cut by issuing cards more rapidly, for example, so that legalizing the status of illegal immigrants later will not seem unfair.
Congressional leaders appear to have learned the lesson of step-by-step reform when it comes to economic stimulus. According to news reports, new stimulus programs and aid to state and local governments may come in the form of smaller packages that are less vulnerable to attack than the Troubled Assets Relief Program and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
Obama and Congress can learn even more from FDR, whose accomplishments were the result more of ceaseless trial and error than of all-or-nothing reform. "The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation," he declared during the 1932 campaign. "It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something."

Full text: Several partygoers were on their way into the Supreme Court one Saturday evening in May to toast retiring Justice John Paul Stevens when they ran into Justice Sonia Sotomayor. She was not heading to the festivities, but coming from her chambers, where she'd been putting in a weekend shift.
She looked neither tired from the long hours nor overwhelmed by her new responsibilities, one of the partygoers noticed. "She was beaming."
In some ways, Sotomayor's just-finished first term on the court was like those of many who have come before her: She worked constantly, turned down interview requests and most speaking engagements, wrote unglamorous and largely noncontroversial opinions and was ideologically true to the president who appointed her. She voted with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg more than any other colleague on the court.
But the court's first Hispanic member, and only its third woman, has hardly had the typical first-termer's experience.
She danced at the White House to a song written in her honor. She arrived in her parents' homeland of Puerto Rico to a heroine's welcome and to find T-shirts and coffee mugs bearing her likeness and the words "wise Latina." The Bronx public housing project where she grew up is now the Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses. When the New York Yankees visited the White House after winning the World Series, team officials made a detour to lug the trophy to her chambers.
Few justices are tracked down at a Manhattan Chinese restaurant by the Daily News, as Sotomayor was last week, when she was asked about the menu (she loves the dumplings) and whether Lindsay Lohan should have been sentenced to jail.
"You know I wouldn't answer that question," a grinning Sotomayor told the reporter. "But I really admire your chutzpah." She added, "That's a New York word."
Sotomayor, 56, remains a New Yorker. She told friends she was looking forward to returning to Manhattan as soon as the term ended, and she has not bought a place in Washington. She has expressed a common New York complaint about Washington: Not enough restaurants deliver.
Still, she is a familiar -- and often recognized -- face in Washington, frequenting the Kennedy Center, dining out with friends, admiring the produce at the "social Safeway" and taking her mother on a tour of Eastern Market. Those who have encountered her report that she has a politician's gift for signing autographs and posing for photos.
Sotomayor has declined to talk to reporters at length, including for this article. But she has delivered commencement addresses at colleges with a personal connection. She handed her niece a diploma at St. Lawrence University, and she spoke to the community college in the Bronx where her mother Celina received a nursing degree.
"This past year, I have often felt like I was living in a dream, wondering when someone was going to pinch me to wake me up," she told the St. Lawrence graduates. "The hours can be long, but I have found that the long hours are painless when you are doing what you love. And I love my job."
Back in Washington, she has admirers -- including members of the court she joined -- and detractors, including Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who say Sotomayor has broken pledges they believe she made at her confirmation hearings last summer.
She has received public accolades from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Antonin Scalia, and friends say she developed a close relationship with Stevens.
"She is not only a really nice, gracious person, she hasn't wasted any time at all in going to work and doing her work thoroughly and carefully as a lawyer should," Stevens said in a recent interview, playing down the idea that he serves as an adviser. "If somebody's qualified for this job, they're qualified the day they're sworn in. She's definitely qualified."
Sotomayor was a judge for 17 years before arriving at the Supreme Court, the last 11 spent on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Paul Clement, who practices before the high court and served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush., said he was impressed at "how comfortable she seems in the role already." If anything, Sotomayor struck some as a little too eager early on. She asked 36 questions in the first argument of the term -- more than any other justice -- and was mildy rebuked by Ginsburg for interrupting with a question before counsel had finished with the senior justice's inquiry.
Those who practice before the court find that she is prepared with detailed questions and has a businesslike manner of establishing the terms of the conflict. As the junior justice, she sits far to the chief justice's left and often looks down the bench for her colleagues' reactions.
Apparently the frilly jabot that she received as a gift from Ginsburg is for special occasions only. For arguments, she wears a plain black robe; the only adornments are large dangling earrings and metallic cuff bracelets that glint as she gestures.
Her remarks are rarely the kind of quips that are marked in transcripts as being followed by laughter. But when she delivered the opinion in a recent case involving the Italian cruise ship company Costa Crociere, she lightheartedly called on Scalia to pronounce the company name for her. He complied, elaborately.
"I always want to use a Spanish accent," she said.
The opinions she has written have not been flashy or the kind that make headlines. In one, she used the term "undocumented immigrant," apparently for the first time in a court opinion, instead of "illegal immigrant."
She has sided with the liberal wing of the court on issues in which ideology appeared to play a role in the outcome, such as gun rights, religious symbols on public land and life sentences without parole for juveniles in non-homicide cases.
"The first thing to say is that there haven't been many surprises," said John Oldham McGinnis, a law professor at Northwestern University. "She appears to be a typical member of the liberal wing." He remarked that experts have said members don't come into their own until serving five years or so. David H. Souter, the justice whom Sotomayor replaced, had been nominated by President George H.W. Bush, and during his first year on the court, he seemed to fit comfortably in its conservative wing. He ended up being a reliable liberal vote.
But McGinnis said Sotomayor has a longer track record as a judge than did Souter, and he sees no reason to believe that her ideology will change.
It is hard to find a significant case in which Sotomayor's replacement of Souter made a difference in the outcome. Doug Kendall of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center holds out hope that she will vote for corporate interests less often than Souter did.
"She's been a formidable personality on the court from the first day on the bench, when she questioned whether corporations have the same constitutional rights as we the people," Kendall said.
Pamela Harris, executive director of Georgetown Law Center's Supreme Court Institute, said she found Sotomayor's most compelling writing in a dissent. In a case testing the famous Miranda rule, Sotomayor objected to the court's 5 to 4 decision, which shifted to suspects the burden of invoking the right to remain silent.
At the time of Sotomayor's nomination by President Obama, some had speculated that her former job as a prosecutor might make her less sympathetic to criminal defendants. But she criticized the court's conservative majority for a "substantial retreat from the protection against compelled self-incrimination."
"I think she'll play an important role in these kinds of cases in the future," Harris said.
Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee are concerned that Sotomayor has not lived up to her pledges. At her hearings last summer, she told the committee that she considered the court's 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to gun ownership, to be "settled law." But when the court last month extended the Second Amendment's reach to local and state governments, Sotomayor joined a dissent that raised questions about whether Heller had been properly decided. Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.) accused Sotomayor of insincerely telling the senators what they wanted to hear.
And Coburn wrote to Sotomayor after she joined the majority opinion that declared juvenile life-without-parole sentences unconstitutional. He objected to the decision's having found support in the idea that the United States is virtually alone in allowing the punishment. "Its conclusion conflicts with your pledge to the Judiciary Committee and the American public 'not to use foreign law to interpret the Constitution,' " he wrote. Coburn acknowledged that the opinion did not rely on foreign law as a precedent.
Being a Supreme Court justice, though, means not explaining your actions beyond the opinion you sign. And in her speeches, Sotomayor has disclosed little of life on the court.
What she has said mostly flatters her colleagues. "It is the level of respect and affection that surprised me," she told the National Association of Women Judges.
"One wouldn't necessarily come to that conclusion" from reading the often-biting opinions and dissents from the ideologically divided court, she said, even though the justices always insist that their differences are not personal. "I was always a little bit dubious. I no longer am," she said.

Full text: Paul Gigot: This week on "The Journal Editorial Report," suing Arizona. Are the administration's immigration tactics ruining any real chance for reform? And President Obama dodges a tough confirmation fight for a top health-care post, but Dr. Donald Berwick's views are hardly a secret. We'll take a closer look at his love of Britain's National Health Service and more. Plus, under fire for the Deepwater Horizon disaster, BP is the company everybody loves to hate. Was the oil giant also behind last year's release of the Lockerbie bomber?
***
Gigot: Welcome to "The Journal Editorial Report." I'm Paul Gigot.
The Justice Department filed suit this week against the state of Arizona over its new immigration law requiring local police to enforce federal immigration statutes. But despite repeated claims by the president and other administration officials that the law could lead to racial profiling, the feds aren't suing Arizona on equal protection grounds. So what's the suit all about?
Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor Dan Henninger, editorial board member Dorothy Rabinowitz and columnist Bill McGurn.
So, Bill, like you--me, you're a longtime supporter of immigration reform.
McGurn: Right.
Gigot: Does this lawsuit get the president any closer to that end?
McGurn: Of course not. It's like giving a speech in July. You're not going to get the legislation there.
Gigot: Before the end of the year.
McGurn: Before the end of the year. I mean, it's not about this. This is just going to create bad feelings. But then again, the Arizona law, I think, was not meant to fix immigration in Arizona. I think it was meant to flush out people that were opposed to enforcement and to poke the federal government.
Gigot: So it was really symbolic in its own right?
McGurn: Yeah, and it was designed to go to the Supreme Court. It's designed to make an issue of this and to show that the federal government has made a big hash of our policy. Where it goes from there, I don't know. But I think they've succeeded in that part.
Gigot: All right, we have a clip of some statements by administration officials about the law before the suit was filed. Here, let's watch.
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano: Unfortunately, I think it does and can invite racial profiling. I think it's bad for law enforcement.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar: What ends up happening is that you do have laws that come up that end up creating the kinds of injuries that are being talked about here, where there is racial profiling, which is a real potential.
Attorney General Eric Holder: And it's certainly one of the concerns that I have, that you will end up in a situation where people are racially profiled.
Gigot: So, Dorothy, three there saying this would lead to racial profiling. Yet they didn't sue on equal protection grounds, which would--essentially antidiscrimination grounds.
Rabinowitz: That's right.
Gigot: Why not?
Rabinowitz: Three demagogues. Yes. They didn't sue on antidiscrimination. But as you say, it's a good way of getting in there and possibly winning. But, you know, there are these nuances. Everybody's going to be sitting back and saying, "Wait a minute, all of the towns and cities across the country have their own little refuges where illegal aliens have been decreed to be free and easy, and there has been no government intervention to say, 'Wait a minute, you're pre-empted, you're pre-empting our laws.'Â " This is one of the great paradoxes.
Gigot: Well, why didn't they--why didn't they sue on equal protection grounds? Because if--they say in public that this was their great fear. Is this a tacit admission that, in fact, on legal grounds, they have no case? Because this doesn't lead to racial profiling?
Rabinowitz: Well, because the law itself is carefully designed to evade that.
Gigot: Ah.
Rabinowitz: They added this, and it's very clear that it says, you have to be arrested in the course of some illegal action.
Gigot: So it's really not that sort of a law.
Rabinowitz: It is not. They couldn't.
Henninger: Not only was it carefully crafted, it in many ways mirrors federal law. So in fact, the Department of Justice has filed this suit under the Supremacy Clause, which argues that federal law pre-empts state law. That's when it gets kind of--first of all, I think they're probably going to win on that.
Gigot: I agree.
Henninger: All right.
Gigot: I think they will win on that. Because this is something that is actually in the Constitution.
Henninger: Yeah.
Gigot: And Congress has the power to control naturalization.
Henninger: And I think at that point, it's going to get political. It'll go to the Supreme Court. Justices Sotomayor and Kagan are going to vote for the federal government. And those people who are currently upset about federalism are going to become even more upset. Secondly, one of the arguments that the Justice Department makes is that federal law is full of complexity and nuance and that their law gets--
Gigot: No kidding?
Henninger: --In the way of enforcement by the State Department, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies who are required to enforce the immigration laws. And that's why they don't work. They're so complex--
Gigot: Which leads to the question--all right, let's say they win in court. Let's say the feds win in court. Where does it get them? What are we left with?
McGurn: We're back to square one.
Gigot: Where--
McGurn: I think, though, it does get the people that crafted this law--I think they were very clever. They got attention on the issue. So they kind of win, whether they win or lose.
Gigot: So what's the motive here driving this lawsuit, Dorothy?
Rabinowitz: Well, exactly. They're not back to square one. They're behind. Because what really happens is that people are enraged, and all it does is agitate. The assumption that all Hispanics are going to come fleeing to the side of the Democrats as a result of this is, I think, very faulty. If you look back at all of those propositions, say in California, at least in the '90s, over 30% of Latinos voted against--voted for propositions.
Gigot: But is the motive here then for the president a political one--
Rabinowitz: Of course it is.
Gigot: --that he hopes to define Republicans as somehow anti-Hispanic because they are in favor of this law? Is that what is driving this?
Rabinowitz: Yes, that is the motive, and it's blatantly that this is the case. And people are not going to respond. The realities of illegal immigration are so overwhelming.
Gigot: Bill, you were in the previous administration as a speechwriter for the president--the chief speechwriter. You wrote some of President Bush's immigration speeches. There was a big effort in 2007 to pass immigration reform.
McGurn: Exactly.
Gigot: What role did Barack Obama play when he was in the Senate?
McGurn: Well, it's very interesting, because we start out--a lot of people point out the similarities between President Obama's speech and President Bush's speech on the general issues.
Gigot: And on the substance, they weren't that far apart.
McGurn: They weren't--that's what I mean, they weren't that far apart. And it was a careful compromise--Kennedy, McCain, all of these people involved--and Barack Obama was in on that, in on the drafting. But then, at the end, he started voting for the amendments backed by labor that were amendment killers--I mean bill killers. And so he played a double game. He was for immigration reform while making it more difficult. He voted for a Dorgan amendment that passed by one vote.
Gigot: Byron Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrat.
McGurn: Right. Attacking the guest-worker program. It would have sunset it out. That was the big necessary thing for the business buy-in. And Jim DeMint, who is totally opposed to the bill--
Gigot: South Carolina Republican.
McGurn: South Carolina--never votes for a labor provision, voted for that one, because he said it would help kill the bill. So it's very, very duplicitous. And I see this again, it's just coming full circle. When you give a speech in July and you need a bipartisan consensus, and you attack Republicans in the speech, you're not going to get--
Gigot: You don't want partisan--
McGurn: You want the issue, you don't want reform.
Gigot: I think the shame is that this is going to poison the well, Dan, not just this year, and nothing--nobody expects anything this year. But I think even to 2011 and 2012, because he's polarized the debate using this Arizona law as the prop.
Henninger: Yeah, and I think that may be the point. Bill is suggesting it's labor that opposes a solution, which would include a guest-worker program for these people to work.
Gigot: Legal avenue to come.
Henninger: Legal avenue. Recall that labor is the one who opposed Mexican trucks coming into the United States under Nafta. So I think the president is kind of carrying water for labor on immigration.
Gigot: All right, Dan, last word.
Still ahead, the president bypasses the Senate to fill a key health-care post. Dr. Donald Berwick will oversee Medicare, Medicaid and much of ObamaCare's new bureaucracy. And he's apparently found his model in Britain's National Health Service. Worried? Maybe you should be.
***
Gigot: Well, when Congress is away, the president will appoint. Mr. Obama used his recess appointment power this week to name a new head of Medicare and Medicaid services, bypassing the Senate confirmation process to install Dr. Donald Berwick in the post. Without any public vetting, Dr. Berwick will now assume control of a bureaucracy with a budget larger than the Defense Department, and he'll play a key role in the implementation of the president's new health-care law.
So just who is Donald Berwick? Senior editorial page writer Joe Rago is here to tell us.
First, let's talk about what this job really is, because it's so easy to lose sense of that in the alphabet soup that is the federal government.
Rago: Right.
Gigot: What does the head of Medicare and Medicaid do?
Rago: Well, they run the two largest entitlement programs--largest health-care entitlement programs in the government.
Gigot: Right.
Rago: It's a giant department. It's the single largest item in the entire federal budget.
Gigot: Four percent of GDP. The entire economy, 4%.
Rago: Right. Headed to up to 6%, 10 years from now.
Gigot: And it determines what doctors get paid, what hospitals get paid for specific services.
Rago: It has enormous power to shape the practice of American medicine.
Gigot: And even more under this new health-care law.
Rago: And far more, with the bill that Congress passed three months ago.
Gigot: OK, so why would the president give a recess appointment to Dr. Berwick, even though Democrats hadn't yet even scheduled a hearing? Of course, they control the Senate, so they could have scheduled it at any time.
Rago: Well, he's got a long history of controversial statements that even Democrats were worried about. You know, about European health-care systems that ration care through government.
Gigot: He likes it.
Rago: He's a huge fan. The British system--the NHS, National Health Service--he called it a "seductress" that he said he was in love with; it's a global treasure, it's a model for the U.S. And so he's got this very voluminous paper trail.
Gigot: And they didn't want to debate that. They didn't want to debate that?
Rago: Well--
Gigot: I thought ObamaCare was supposed to become more popular. Bill Clinton, for one, and I think even the president's political aides told Democrats: You vote for this, it's going to be more popular after it passes than during the ugly debate. I would think they would welcome a debate on this.
Henninger: Paul, I think this Berwick recess appointment is literally the biggest political event in the summer--of the summer. This is outrageous. I think his appointment should have hearings that are as important as those for Elena Kagan's nomination to the Supreme Court. There are huge issues at stake here. And this is the first individual person who has emerged from the Obama health-care plan. And Dr. Berwick is a living representative of what Barack Obama and all of the health-care economists in the White House want to do, which is to transform the American health-care system in a way that kind of levels it out, rather than emphasizes the cutting-edge research for which this country has been famous. There's so much at stake here.
Gigot: On this point, I want to read something, a quote from him. This is: "The decision is not whether or not we will ration care--the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open." Now, Republicans say this is a radical statement. You say it isn't. Why?
Rago: No. I think it's--first, it's conventional among the entire health policy and academic left.
Gigot: That you have to ration this way.
Rago: Right.
Gigot: They all agree with this.
Rago: And it's not rationed through price signals and individual decisions. It's through brute government force and sort of raw government power.
Gigot: All right, we have another clip I want to show. This time a quote--this time it's a clip. Let's listen.
Berwick: Any health-care funding plan that is just, equitable, civilized and humane must--must--redistribute wealth from the richer among us to the poorer and the less fortunate. Excellent health care is, by definition, redistributional.
Gigot: Joe the Plumber, where are you when we need you? I mean, this is what they said would happen during the campaign. And again, I don't think this is all that radical in White House circles. This is what the health-care bill does.
Henninger: Well, the current issue of Health Affairs, which is kind of the bible for these people, has an article by a Harvard political scientist, Theda Skocpol, who says: "We can predict that much of the intended redistribution will be reversed because so many people are going to try to game the system and fight the taxes and fees that are embedded in it." That's what it's about.
Gigot: But when the government tries to subsidize everybody, then it becomes very, very expensive, and then you have to make decisions about rationing care for everybody.
Rago: Right. And what you get is a situation like the British system that Donald Berwick loves so much, where, you know, cutting-edge treatments, the sort of most advanced--
Gigot: Avastin, say, for colorectal cancer, something like that?
Rago: Right. Where you're getting very specialized treatments tailored to individual patients. It just all sort of gets flattened out. And if some people suffer, you know, that's sort of the price of having--
Gigot: An--egalitarian health care.
Rago: Exactly.
Gigot: Now you've been following Massachusetts, which was a prototype of what we're going to get nationally, passed in 2006. How's that working out?
Rago: Well, you know, it's kind of a rolling disaster. It's--every week, there's sort of a new controversy. The latest one that's going on right now is Mitt Romney's predecessor, Deval Patrick--
Gigot: Successor as governor.
Rago: Successor, excuse me--has imposed price controls on all state insurance plans, so he says, well, medical costs are rising at 8% a year--
Gigot: We have to clamp down on prices? We have to--
Rago: Right. And you're seeing--he doesn't only want to attack the insurers, but now he's starting to move into doctors and hospitals and other forms of providers as well.
Gigot: And this is the debate we're going to see nationally.
All right, Joe. We've got to go.
Henninger: But they're not letting us have.
Gigot: That they don't want to have in Congress. Exactly right, Dan.
All right. Still ahead, it's under fire for the Deepwater drilling disaster, but there may be an even better reason to dislike BP. Did the oil giant profit from the Lockerbie bomber's release? The answer when we come back.
***
Gigot: Well, BP has come under blistering criticism in recent months as oil from its Deepwater Horizon well continues to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. But Wall Street Journal foreign-affairs columnist Bret Stephens says there may be even better reason to dislike the oil giant, as evidence grows that BP profited from last summer's release of Lockerbie bomber Abdel Baset al-Megrahi. Bret joins us now.
So Bret, what's the connection between BP and the release of Megrahi?
Stephens: Well, just a few days ago, the Libyan government announced BP would begin deepwater drilling in its--
Gigot: Off of Libya.
Stephens: Off of the Libyan coast.
Gigot: Notwithstanding the Gulf of Mexico?
Stephens: Definitely notwithstanding the Gulf of Mexico. And in fact, that Libya might take a strategic stake in BP. Now, this follows news also in recent days that Abdel Baset al-Megrahi--the only man convicted for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, who was released last year on the compassionate grounds that he only had a few months to live, and is still alive--might, in fact, live another 10 or 20 years. That was a statement by a doctor who offered the three-month prognosis but now says that he more or less gave that prognosis because he thought it could be, quote, "sort of justified."
Gigot: Well, let's take this in turn. This offshore drilling in Libya is very big, something like a $900 million project. So it's a very big contract. BP itself said it was something like the equivalent of 2,000 blocks, exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico.
Stephens: Oh, it's absolutely enormous, because these are oil blocks right off the coast, which Libya itself doesn't have the--the Libyan oil company doesn't have the technology to explore. But they need a big Western oil company that can do the kind of deepwater drilling. And the question is, how did BP get itself to get these contracts?
Gigot: Well, that is the question, because the British deny any quid pro quo between the release of Megrahi and the contracts. BP denies it, I'm sure. So what's the evidence?
Stephens: Well, look, in 2004, when Gadhafi came in from the cold, then--
Gigot: Gave up his nuclear program.
Stephens: Gave up his nuclear program.
Gigot: Said he wanted to normalize relations.
Stephens: Tony Blair paid a number of--
Gigot: Former British prime minister.
Stephens: Former British prime minister, paid a number of visits. And on his second visit, in 2007, BP and the Libyan government inked an oil-exploration deal. But there was a hiccup. The Libyans were insisting on what they call a prisoner transfer agreement between the two countries, which sounds like, you know, one of these vanilla agreements that two countries reach. But the man that was plainly in question in any kind of prisoner transfer agreement was Megrahi, the guy who was then in a Scottish jail.
So they made this agreement, and then the U.K. took its time with this prisoner transfer agreement. So the Libyan government starting saying, Well, we're not so sure we're going to go ahead with the BP deal. At this point, we know--BP has admitted that it raised the issue of the prisoner transfer agreement with the then Labour government in Britain. It had a special adviser who was a former MI6 intelligence official, who was well connected with Labour Party officials, and who also raised the subject of the prisoner transfer agreement. Lo and behold, at the end of 2007, the U.K. finally gets around to signing--to signing this agreement, and it's at that point that the BP deal starts going forward.
Gigot: We also have a statement from Gadhafi's son, who has wanted to open up to the West, and is well-known in British circles that the oil contract was at issue.
Stephens: Yeah, no, it's clear both from what--not only from what the Libyans have said, Saif Gadhafi, but also from correspondence that was obtained by the London Sunday Times, in which then-Justice Minister Jack Straw writes to his Scottish counterparts, talking about the, quote, "overwhelming interests of the U.K. in getting this agreement passed." And it's funny. The Libyans kept dragging their heels all the way up until Megrahi was released.
Gigot: Here's a question, though: Why shouldn't Britain do this? I mean, it's in their national interest, obviously, to have oil exploration--a company do this. Megrahi is ill. We don't know how ill, that's true. And this is 20-some years ago. Here's the question: I mean, if Gadhafi wants to come in from the cold--maybe, shouldn't we just move on?
Stephens: I would say there are 270 reasons not to do that, and those are the 270 people who were murdered on Pan Am 103. I mean, there's no question, the oil companies go into all kinds of dangerous places with regimes that we don't necessarily like, which have spotty human-rights records. But Lockerbie is a case apart. And it's also in the U.K.'s national interest to have good relations with the United States. This was a signal case in the war on terrorism, so there was a line to be drawn, and the British crossed it, in my mind.
Gigot: All right, Bret, thank you.
We have to take one more break. When we come back, our "Hits and Misses" of the week.
***
Gigot: Just as a follow-up to that previous segment, we did ask BP for comment. They promised to get back to us but never did.
Time now for our "Hit or Misses" of the week. Dorothy, first to you.
Rabinowitz: Yes, well, right to it. Our NASA chief, Charles Bolden, our new NASA chief, announced to al-Jazeera, quite unbelievably, that one of the things he was told to do was, and I quote, "to reach out, above all, to predominantly Muslims nations to make them feel good about their contributions in math and science and engineering," unquote.
Now, this is a lot like the teaching in self-esteem they give to inner-city children. And this is what our NASA chief has been told to do. We can think about this as one of the naked revelations of the Obama administration's remarkable tendency to politicize every function of government, including space age. And you can put this down as one of the many, many things that this administration is going to be found unbelievable about.
Gigot: Joe?
Rago: I want to give a hit this week to LeBron James for choosing the Miami Heat in the NBA. Not for anything to do with the team, but because he chose low-tax Florida, actually zero-tax Florida--
Gigot: State taxes.
Rago: --over Cleveland, which has a 6% rate in the city. And the Tax Foundation calculates that he made millions of dollars on this. And just wait until all state championships are a function of state tax law.
Gigot: All right. Bret?
Stephens: Well, like a stopped clock, a totalitarian regime is right maybe twice every 30 years. The government of Iran, which stones women, hangs homosexuals, has banned the mullet and the male ponytail. I think this is actually a credit to the Iranian regime for showing, for once, a little bit of good taste.
Gigot: Good taste.
All right, that's it for this week's edition of "The Journal Editorial Report." Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. We hope to see you all right here next week.

Full text: So I sent my mother the immigrant off to Arizona.
She had her U.S. passport, of course. But thinking she needed something more, she took her wallet and showed me she was carrying her Social Security card too.
"No, mother," I said. "You don't need that. And it's sort of dangerous to have it with you because there's this thing called identity theft...."
She took it anyway.
Mercedes Dotson, nee Alvarez, is 67 years old and a cautious woman.
A few months ago, I mentioned her desire to cancel her long-planned trip to the Grand Canyon State in light of SB 1070, the law that gives Arizona police new powers to enforce immigration laws.
My mother was born in Guatemala and came to the U.S. at the age of 20. She had heard that Arizona police could detain anyone they suspect of being undocumented -- presumably anyone, like her, who had an accent. I persuaded her that she should go to Arizona anyway. So did all of her old friends in Arizona.
Since my mother is an excellent reader of emotions, I was interested in getting her take on what's going on over there, on the other side of the Colorado River.
So as she prepared to board the train to Flagstaff, I asked her to take notes. To be my eyes and ears in Arizona. I knew this was like asking the pope to say Mass -- because my mother lives to reflect on the things that happen to her and then write them down. That's probably how I got the writing bug.
" No se preocupe," she told me. Don't worry.
It was to be her first visit in many years to the place where she lived with her late husband. A week later, I picked her up at Union Station and she presented me with a notebook filled with 36 pages of observations.
"To my son Hector," the first page reads. "A small summary of my trip to Sedona, Ariz."
While she was in Arizona, my mother visited majestic Cathedral Rock and prayed at an outdoor chapel -- but did not once feel in danger of the authorities. But her notes reveal that she did experience something nearly as wrenching to the heart.
In Sedona, she was reminded of the growing tension between the two worlds she has lived in since she was 20 -- one English-speaking, the other mostly Spanish-speaking, both filled with people she respects.
She found some English-speaking friends a little glib in their dismissal of people's fears.
"Mercedes, how could you be concerned about the new law?" one asked her. "There's no profiling. You're only going to be stopped if you're breaking the law!"
This same longtime friend, who before had seemed apolitical, was upset at the immigrants rights groups calling for a boycott of the state.
My mother was surprised by the sudden anger.
Being in Arizona made her reflect on her own immigrant experience. She thought about the people who've arrived in the U.S. after she did and was inspired to write down a list of principles all current and future immigrants should follow.
"1. Learn the language. 2. Obey and respect the law. 3. Be careful of the image you project -- without losing your identity. 4. Imitate the good things -- but don't get caught up in [the Americans'] bad habits. 5. Never be embarrassed to say where you are from. 6. Be grateful for the opportunities you are given. 7. And give something back that will enrich your adopted country."
Words of wisdom, of course. But she kept feeling rankled, despite all her perspective.
"Our governor is only trying to protect our borders because we don't have any federal help," another of her Anglo friends told her.
"Somehow, the word 'protect' bothered me," my mother wrote, because it was said with a "tone of discrimination."
The new Arizona law is meant to "protect" Americans from danger -- and it bothers my mother that so many Americans think of their Latin American neighbors as a source of danger.
Her Mexican-born friends spoke of strange encounters with local police. Some involved traffic stops made with what seemed like the flimsiest of excuses.
A son-in-law of a friend, she was told, was pulled over for "leaving a dog on the street corner" -- even though he's never owned a dog.
"All I know is that before I felt free to go anywhere," said Antonia Rodriguez, a native of Agua Prieta, Mexico, and a naturalized U.S. citizen. "And now if I don't have my passport with me, I feel scared."
Those who aren't citizens, her Mexican-born friends told her, fear being deported and separated from their U.S.-born children.
After listening to all these stories and seeing the fear in her friends' eyes, my mother wrote: "Just the idea of seeing a police car behind you, and knowing they can stop you and ask you for your papers does something to your dignity."
"I've never been a person with a complex," my mother wrote, by which she meant she's never been hung up on the idea that she was the victim of discrimination. "But this new law makes me feel sad."
It would be inaccurate, however, to say that my mother didn't enjoy her trip to Arizona.
"This has been a great trip in which I've realized how wonderful it is to have friends who are North American and Mexican American," she wrote in her final entry.
She went to two Catholic Masses, in English and Spanish. She watched the sun set over Sedona's red rocks with her friend Marilyn Dyer, and enjoyed a meal of carne asada under a full moon with her friends the Rodriguezes.
In other words, my mother got the full Arizona smorgasbord: a little fear, a little loathing, much natural beauty and the satisfaction of enduring friendships.
Doesn't sound like a bad place to visit -- if you don't mind carrying a passport.

Full text: Arizona's sweeping illegal immigration law has reignited debate throughout the country about calls for comprehensive reform. But as the nation's governors gathered this weekend, the topic was absent from their agenda, even as demonstrators rallied nearby.
Organizers of the National Governors Assn.'s summer meeting said there was no conscious effort to avoid the topic, but they conceded that differences among state leaders made it an unlikely discussion point.
"Governors have different points of view, [and] we're a consensus-based organization," said Gov. Jim Douglas (R-Vt.), the organization's chairman. "My view, and I know some of my colleagues' views, is what's happening in Arizona -- regardless of what you feel about it -- points to the need for a federal solution."
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed Arizona Senate Bill 1070, did attract attention and was swarmed by reporters at the first public event of the meeting. Brewer said that some of her colleagues had expressed support for Arizona's action and were eagerly tracking the U.S. Justice Department's lawsuit seeking to block it.
"They do understand the problems that we face," said Brewer, a Republican. "People want the federal government to do their job, and if they won't do it, the states will do it."
While governors have offered differing opinions on Arizona's law, there was widespread agreement that the federal government needed to act.
"I thought a couple years ago we were on the road to finding one," Douglas said, referring to a failed effort by President George W. Bush in 2007.
"Well, it didn't happen. So we've got to find a way to recognize the reality of the problem while respecting laws of our country."
Even some of Brewer's Republican colleagues were cool to the idea of passing similar laws in their states. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for instance, said he did not want to further burden local law enforcement with what is a federal concern. Others said the states faced more pressing issues, particularly with regard to budgets.
"It's still an issue of national importance, but it's not -- at least in some parts of the country -- as hot as it was," Gov. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) said.
Groups opposed to the Arizona measure organized a march on the convention site. The Washington-based ANSWER Coalition expected more than 1,000 to attend, but only several hundred gathered for the rally. Heavy rain further diminished the turnout.

Full text: Every evening, millions of families in India gather around their TV sets to watch "Balika Vadhu," a soap opera about a married 8-year-old girl. At the same time, Indian households in the U.S. that have access to it switch to Appka Colors on the Dish Network to catch the child-bride saga, weighing in with their friends and relatives in India on online message boards.
That connection between immigrants here and their relatives back home was a key consideration when Colors, the highest-ranked general entertainment channel in India, launched in the U.S. this year. Reaching 40 million households in India, the 2-year-old channel, a joint venture between Viacom and Indian media conglomerate Network 18, is hoping to replicate some measure of that success stateside.
"Once we gathered critical mass in India, we believed that the viewership patterns of those who migrated to the U.S. were similar," said Rajesh Kamat, chief operating officer of Mumbai-based Colors.
In January, Colors linked with Dish; it is now part of a Hindi language paid-subscription package on the satellite service. "People here had heard through word of mouth from those in India about Colors," said Chris Kuelling, vice president of international programming for Dish, which first began broadcasting Hindi programming in the U.S. more than a decade ago. "And those who now have it seem to be very pleased with it."
Colors is among the latest to join the growing roster of programming directed toward Indians, a demographic that ranks among the most highly educated immigrant populations in the country. According to the U.S. census, the Indian American population in the country was 1.7 million in 2000, a figure that had doubled since 1990, and is likely to have doubled again. The largest concentration is in California, followed by New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Florida. The majority are college graduates. They have the highest per capita income of immigrant populations. Advertisers appealing to the demographic include Citibank, State Farm, Vonage and Metlife, which create ads specifically for the market.
As a result, just about every cable and satellite provider offers Hindi-language channels and a growing diet of varied programming. Industry executives decline to reveal numbers, but estimate that at least one third of South Asian households in the U.S. subscribe to some type of entertainment package.
--
Humble beginning
Showbiz India, a weekly, hourlong show which started 12 years ago (channel 18 in the Los Angeles area), was the first television resource for Indians and some other South Asians. "We were around before the advent of the other platforms, but there is clearly enough demand for this kind of programming that we are all co-existing," said Reshma Dordi, the show's founder and host. She says she is often stopped in the streets by non-South Asians who tune in for the music videos, interviews with visiting Bollywood stars and features about Bollywood productions.
"We're seeing a real flowering in demand," said David Jensen, vice president of content acquisition for Comcast. The cable operator provides eight South Asian linear channels -- among them SET Asia (Sony), Zee TV and Star India Plus -- in Northern California but is looking to expand its reach into other parts of the country this year. A new platform providing some 90 ethnic channels will include 10 targeted toward Indians. Comcast also carries Bollywood Hits on Demand nationwide.
The rise in population numbers, awareness and demand has dovetailed with increased technical capacity, he said. "Those in programming will be asking, 'What can we do with all this new bandwidth?' And the two areas that stand out are Bollywood and the Hispanic community," he said.

American influence
Executives say that the nature of the programming is poised to change, taking into consideration U.S.-born Indians whose tastes are more inclined toward mainstream American television. According to Jensen, that could offer opportunities for programming for children as well as sports shows.
And although the old favorites remain -- Bollywood movies, music videos, long-running soap operas, news shows -- reality programming is also beginning to emerge. Colors in India has created Indian versions of "Fear Factor" and "Big Brother."
"The question was, 'How well can you add the flavor of curry to it and retain the essence of the shows?'" Kamat said. For "Fear Factor," Colors enlisted Bollywood action star Akshay Kumar and romantic comedy actress Priyanka Chopra as hosts, and populated its contestants with national cricketers (in the U.S., that would be akin to having Matt Damon and Katherine Heigl host and NBA stars performing the stunts).
"The first-generation South Asian community is very attached to the programming they're used to. There's a great deal of nostalgia for them," said Scott Wheeler, senior vice president of network development for International Media Distribution, part of Comcast. But as technology improves, he said, there could be more variety.
Kamlesh Patel, a consultant specializing in the South Asian market, agrees that the way forward is to change the type of programming. "For the first-generation Indians, what works in India works in the U.S. They are used to the routine soap opera dramas. But third-generation U.S.-born Indians are not going to find that interesting. They were brought up on a staple diet of NFL and NBA programming, action movies and thrillers. What they will want may have to have the same level of sanitation (as Hindi programming), but perhaps with a little greater adventure."

Reaching out to immigrants in the L.A. workforce; A federal commission teaches employers from elsewhere about U.S. harassment laws.

Abstract: Buoyed by increased funding under the Obama administration, federal officials in Los Angeles are boosting efforts to educate immigrant communities about U.S. laws against racial bias and sexual harassment. The EEOC has also brought successful actions against a Korean-owned janitorial firm, which agreed to pay $150,000 in 2007 to settle allegations of sexual harassment brought by Latina workers at Los Angeles International Airport.

Full text: Buoyed by increased funding under the Obama administration, federal officials in Los Angeles are boosting efforts to educate immigrant communities about U.S. laws against racial bias and sexual harassment.
The Los Angeles regional office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has tripled the number of investigators from eight to 24 in the last year, hiring people fluent in Korean, Spanish, Thai, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Portuguese and American Sign Language.
And early this month, the office held its first training seminar for immigrant employers on federal anti-discrimination laws. The English-Korean bilingual seminar, held in Koreatown, drew about two dozen restaurant owners, insurance brokers and other business people.
Koreatown restaurant owner Tu Ik Chang urged fellow business owners to learn about U.S. laws. Earlier this month, he settled a sexual harassment case from 2005 brought by several female employees against the restaurant's former manager. Chang -- who was out of the country when the harassment occurred but was still liable and paid $170,000 in compensation -- agreed to train his staff on anti-discrimination laws and to cooperate with the EEOC in reaching out to other Korean business owners.
"We are only familiar with Korean culture," Chang told the group. "We've never been educated about U.S. culture, especially business culture, racial discrimination or labor relations issues. But when Koreans come to the U.S. and become business owners, they have to become familiar with these laws."
Immigrants make up nearly half the workforce in Los Angeles County. But many of them are ignorant of U.S. laws that protect people from discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, gender, age and disability. And many immigrants refuse to file complaints because of the perceived stigma, said Anna Park, regional attorney for the commission's Los Angeles office.
"It's a chronic problem in the immigrant communities that people aren't complaining about discrimination, and employers aren't educating themselves about their obligations under anti-discrimination federal law," Park said. "It will take a lot of public cases for them to see that this is something they need to pay attention to."
In February, a Chinese-owned management firm for the San Gabriel Hilton agreed to pay $500,000 to settle a case involving national origin and sexual harassment complaints. The EEOC charged that the firm, Landwin Management, illegally replaced its mostly Latino banquet servers with less-qualified Chinese workers.
The EEOC has also brought successful actions against a Korean-owned janitorial firm, which agreed to pay $150,000 in 2007 to settle allegations of sexual harassment brought by Latina workers at Los Angeles International Airport. Unicom Electric Inc., a Chinese-owned computer firm in City of Industry, paid $350,000 in 2004 to settle discrimination complaints, including those citing use of racial epithets.
In an interview, Chang said he was deeply chagrined by the sexual harassment case. The 60-year-old entrepreneur said he had high hopes when he decided to expand his Chilbo Myunok barbeque and noodle restaurant chain to Los Angeles five years ago. He invested $1 million, created jobs for nearly 40 workers and, he said, felt proud to see patrons lining up -- sometimes for more than an hour -- for a seat.
He missed the restaurant's grand opening in April 2005 because of pressing business in Seoul. When he returned to Los Angeles four months later, he said some of his female workers went to him with complaints about the manager. He said they never alleged sexual harassment -- only that he had a "bad personality" and was an ineffective manager. Chang said he agreed to fire him.
Later that year, he said, he received an EEOC complaint notice. The women alleged that the manager touched them with a sexual device, made lewd comments about their bodies and forced them to go to after-hours karaoke bars, among other complaints.
Chang said he was stunned by the EEOC notice and befuddled that he was liable for someone else's behavior. South Korea's sexual harassment law does not hold owners responsible for the actions of others, he said.
"I never did anything bad to my employees, so why do I have to suffer?" he asked.
In the training seminar, Park and other EEOC attorneys explained such points as what constitutes harassment, who can file complaints and how to defend against them. Park advised the business owners to have effective anti-discrimination policies and procedures in place, promptly address any complaints and take corrective action.
Chang said he wants to help other business owners learn from his experience. But it has shaken his faith in the American Dream. He has put plans to expand his restaurants to other U.S. cities on hold. And he said he is now afraid to make any personal gestures to employees, such as conversing beyond a quick hello, offering them coffee or sitting with them during staff barbeque parties, for fear someone will sue him.
"It's been very painful," he said. "I regret opening a business in America and I just want to close it down and go back to Korea."

For new economic direction, try north; The U.S. could learn from Canada, whose finances are already back in great shape.

Abstract: [...] as Americans continue their grueling battle over immigration, Canadians have united behind a policy that emphasizes opening the door to tens of thousands of skilled professionals, entrepreneurs and other productive workers who have played an important role in strengthening the Canadian economy. Earlier that decade, Canada too was straining from years of excessive government spending that bloated the nation's total debts, to 70% of annual economic output -- a figure the U.S. is projected to approach in two years.

Full text: Whatever else they've thought about their neighbor to the north, Americans have almost never looked to Canada as a role model.
Indeed, during the long, bitter push to revamp the U.S. healthcare system, opponents repeatedly warned that, if we weren't careful, we could end up with a medical system like Canada's.
But on healthcare, and such crucial issues as the deficit, unemployment, immigration and prospering in the global economy, Canada seems to be outperforming the United States. And in doing so, it is offering examples of successful strategies that Americans might consider.
While the United States, Japan and much of Europe are struggling with massive fiscal deficits, Canada's financial house is tidy and secure. Most economists say it will take years for the United States to make up the 8 million-plus jobs lost during the recession, but Canada -- despite its historic role as a major supplier for the still-troubled U.S. auto industry -- already has recovered essentially all of the jobs it lost.
Meanwhile, as Americans continue their grueling battle over immigration, Canadians have united behind a policy that emphasizes opening the door to tens of thousands of skilled professionals, entrepreneurs and other productive workers who have played an important role in strengthening the Canadian economy.
Granted, Canada's problem with illegal immigration is smaller, and its economy does not match the scale and dynamic productivity of the world's largest. But on the most troubling issues of the day, the U.S. is locked in near-paralyzing political and ideological debates, while those issues are hardly raising eyebrows in Canada.
"We did a lot of things right going into the financial crisis," said Glen Hodgson, senior vice president at the Conference Board of Canada, a business-membership and research group in Ottawa.
One of the most important, he said: Back in the 1990s, Canada cleaned up the fiscal mess that most every developed nation is now facing.
Earlier that decade, Canada too was straining from years of excessive government spending that bloated the nation's total debts, to 70% of annual economic output -- a figure the U.S. is projected to approach in two years.
As with Greece, Portugal and Spain this year, Canada's credit rating was downgraded in the early 1990s, sharply raising its borrowing costs. With its economy suffering and pressure mounting from international investors -- Wall Street bankers in particular -- Canadian officials slashed spending for social programs and shifted more of the cost burden to provincial governments, which almost everyone in Canada felt.
"I had to share a phone line with another professor. Can you believe it?" recalled Wenran Jiang, who joined the University of Alberta's political science faculty in 1993. Professors there and elsewhere also took salary cuts.
It would take several years of such tough medicine, but as Canada headed into the new millennium, the government's total debts were shaved nearly in half, and then whittled down to a little more than 20% of gross domestic product just before the global recession began in 2008 -- by far the lowest ratio among major developed countries.
With the economic downturn, Canada pumped up public spending to stimulate growth, as other nations did. Still, its fiscal shortfall this year is projected at $33 billion, comfortably below the 3%-of-GDP threshold that economists consider a manageable level of debt.
Washington's deficit this fiscal year is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at $1.35 trillion -- or 9.2% of projected GDP.
The United States' larger size -- its population and economy are roughly 10 times those of Canada -- makes direct comparisons difficult. And many Canadians readily acknowledge that American entrepreneurship and productivity are enviably stronger.
But having learned to tighten their belts in the 1990s, Canadians such as Michael Gregory have little sympathy for U.S. consumers who pile debt onto their credit cards and homes.
"We've been taught: You don't buy what you can't afford," said Gregory, a senior economist at the Bank of Montreal.
Similarly, Canadian banks have been more conservative than American ones. So they made few subprime loans, and home equity lines are relatively recent offerings in Canada.
Yet their solid if unexciting product lines and financial results mean Canadian firms can now expand lending. This as U.S. banks continue to refrain from extending credit, thus restraining spending, investment and job growth.
Canada's stricter banking regulations and bankruptcy rules certainly have played a role too, but Gregory attributes part of the difference to cultural factors. When he worked for now-defunct Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. in New York in the late 1990s, he drove a Ford minivan or a Toyota Camry while many of his colleagues tooled around in BMWs and other luxury brands.
"It was consumerism. People spent more money, ate out more, bought more stuff," Gregory said. "I felt awkward."
Canadian firms weren't unscathed by the credit debacle and the global economic retreat. And Canada's strong currency -- the loonie is worth just a few cents less than the U.S. dollar -- is sure to pinch Canadian exports, much of which head south.
But unlike the United States, where the financial crisis turned into the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression, the hit to Canada was fairly mild.
In the final quarter of last year, Canada's GDP surged nearly 5%, rising even higher in this year's first quarter. Growth in the U.S. slowed sharply early this year, heightening fears of a double-dip recession.
"U.S. businesses are certainly looking at lessons learned from Canada," said Bart van Ark, chief economist at the Conference Board in New York. "In a nutshell, Canada has been very pragmatic in dealing with the economy."
Its approach to immigration is one example. With one of the highest immigration rates in the world, Canada has been receiving about 250,000 permanent residents annually. About one-fourth of the new arrivals gain entry through family relations, but more than 60% are admitted as "economic immigrants" -- that is, skilled workers, entrepreneurs and investors.
In the U.S., it's basically the reverse: Most of the 1 million-plus permanent residents received annually have been family-sponsored; only about 1 in 7 are admitted based on employment preferences. That is, Washington emphasizes bringing in family members of immigrants already in the U.S. Ottawa puts the emphasis on admitting those who can contribute to the economy.
Many Americans, of course, don't see that as the key difference. The estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. are what dominate public discussions of immigration policy.
"The thing about the U.S. is you have a border with Mexico, which Canada doesn't," said Jeffrey Reitz, a sociologist and immigration expert at the University of Toronto.
He figures that as many as 300,000 illegal immigrants reside in Canada, not a small number for a country of its size. But there's no really good estimate, which Reitz views as a reflection of just how little the subject weighs on the nation.
"The big issue is how immigrants, though highly skilled, aren't getting jobs as easily," Reitz said.
As for most Canadians' attitude toward immigration, he said, they seem to know that their country needs new arrivals because of Canada's small population and a birth rate that is lower than in the U.S.
"The vast majority of Canadians accept that immigration is essential to the economic and demographic future of the country, and that openness is a Canadian value," said Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. "I know that sounds terribly crazy to us."
Even as some economists in the U.S. have pushed for a Canadian-style system that gives points for higher education, work skills and experience, the policy discussion almost always seems to hinge on illegal immigrants.
"That sucks all the oxygen from the debate," Papademetriou said. As a result, he said, not much policy attention is given to important concerns -- increasing visas for skilled workers, enabling people with advanced degrees to obtain residency, adding greater flexibility to the system to better compete in a global economy.
Over the years, Canada in fact has adapted some of the strengths of the U.S. immigration policy, such as the H1B work visa program, to shore up its weaknesses, he said. The H1B program allows employers to bring in foreign workers in specialty occupations on a temporary basis. The U.S., on the other hand, has dealt with its immigration policy like a political hot potato.
"Canada has really outshone the United States," he said. "That's a reality."

Full text: The exhibition "Document: Iranian-Americans in L.A." is straightforward photojournalism that raises some tangled issues.
On view at UCLA's Fowler Museum through Aug. 22, it's a collaboration between Amy Malek, a UCLA doctoral student in anthropology and four Iranian American photographers: Farhad Parsa, Arash Saedinia, Parisa Taghizadeh and Ramin Talaie. Together, they collected images and stories of 39 second-generation Iranian Americans living in L.A., home to the world's largest Iranian expat population. ("Second-generation" refers to those born in the U.S. to immigrant parents or who arrived here as children.)
The result brings the faces and voices of an under-recognized group to light but falls a bit short of its broader ambition, stated in the exhibition brochure, "to emphasize the process of documentation by incorporating the multiple voices, expressions and subject positions of those who have worked to create it."
There is certainly no lack of diversity in the portraits, whose subjects range in age from 4 to 48 and represent a variety of occupations -- plastic surgeon, comedian, poet, police officer -- as well as religious affiliations, including Muslim, Christian and Jewish. Each person is pictured at his or her home or place of work, worship or recreation, accompanied by a biographical text and quotes. They are arranged not by age, occupation or theme but by photographer, a decision that allows the artists' voices to come through as well.
It's a lot to absorb, although to Malek's credit the texts are well written and tightly focused on each individual; viewers are allowed to draw their own connections between the stories.
The 1979 revolution that prompted many families to flee Iran comes up repeatedly, as does an evolving sense of cultural dislocation and invisibility. We learn that Reza Aslan, now a prominent author and scholar on the Middle East, spent a few years in the early '80s pretending to be Mexican. A generation later, Shahab Sharifian refused to check the box for "White" on his college applications, preferring to write in "Iranian."
"Document" marks the emergence of a sense of Iranian American identity, even as it threatens to explode any attempt to actually define it. This tension between the desire for unity and the inherent diversity of any community is something every marginalized group confronts as it seeks recognition in the mainstream. That Iranian Americans are coming into their own in an environment in which multiplicity is a given reveals how ideas about ethnicity have expanded since the emergence of identity politics in the 1960s. While it's still politically important for minorities to find ways of defining and representing themselves, adherence to a monolithic cultural essence is no longer required.
This shift stems in part from our increasing awareness of how media are constructed. It's harder to accept reductive portrayals of ethnic groups when we know that any media account is just one version of the story. With its multiple voices, "Document" not only attests to the complexity of Iranian American identity, it also suggests that there are many ways to communicate it. For example, grouping the works by photographer allows subtle variations in style and tone to emerge. Talaie's and Taghizadeh's photos have the crispness of magazine portraits, while Saedinia takes a more intimate, moody approach and Parsa uses triptychs as a way of creating multifaceted if somewhat distant portraits of his own family.
Still, the show doesn't go far enough in this direction. It relies too much on text, which is sometimes dry and overwhelms the photos.
In the exhibit brochure, Malek notes that she videotaped the interactions between the photographers and their subjects -- some of that footage might have enlivened things. Sometimes you can learn more about a person by simply observing his or her behavior than by reading what the individual says. Such behind-the-scenes information might have opened up the dialogue about shared identity and individuality even more, raising questions of authenticity and self-presentation.
While the exhibition is titled "Document," its strength is not the light it sheds on the process of documentation but rather the glimpses it provides into individual lives. For a people whose collective identity is still emerging, perhaps that's enough -- for now.

Full text: Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said Sunday he might sue Arizona a second time if its new tough-on-illegal-immigrants law leads to racial profiling.
The nation's top law enforcement officer said the federal government's lawsuit against Arizona, filed last week, made scant mention of racial profiling because it focused on the stronger argument that the state law preempted the federal government's responsibility in deciding immigration policies.
The Arizona law requires police to check the immigration status of people who are stopped for other reasons if they are "reasonably suspected" of being in the country illegally.
The measure is scheduled to take effect July 29. But the federal government is seeking a temporary injunction to block the law while its suit is being heard. A hearing on that request is set for July 22.
Holder said the U.S. had to take a variety of factors into account when drawing up immigration laws, including international relations and national security.
"And it is the responsibility of the federal government, as opposed to states doing it on a patchwork basis," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation."
"It doesn't mean that if the law, for whatever reason, happened to go into effect, that six months from now, a year from now, we might not look at the impact the law has had" and determine if there had been racial profiling, Holder said. "And if that was the case, we would have the tools and we would bring suit on that basis."
In answer to a question, Holder denied suing Arizona for political reasons to brand Republicans as "anti-immigration" or "anti-Hispanic."
"Not true at all," he said.
Holder said the basis for the suit was a legal determination that the law was "inconsistent with the Constitution."
In other news, Holder said a decision was pending on where -- and how -- to put self-proclaimed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four alleged accomplices on trial. Opposition to Holder's plan to try them in New York has officials searching for a new venue.
Holder said a military base in Virginia was one of "any number of possibilities," but there were "real questions" as to whether a defendant who pleaded guilty in a military tribunal could be sentenced to death.
He also said the Obama administration still wanted to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility -- as it pledged to do within a year of taking office -- but that it needed Congress to approve money to buy an underutilized prison in Thomson, Ill., and use part of that facility to house the detainees.
Asked if other places wanted the detainees, Holder said "a couple of other states" were interested but refused to identify them.
"I don't want to necessarily talk about them now because I think we have a very firm commitment from the people in Thomson and from state officials in Illinois" to accept the terrorist suspects from Guantanamo, he said.

Obama is modest about U.S., not himself

Author: Krauthammer, Charles

Publication info: Chicago Tribune ; Chicago, Ill. [Chicago, Ill]12 July 2010: 17.

Abstract: It began with the almost comical self-inflation of his presidential campaign, from the still inexplicable mass rally in Berlin in front of a Prussian victory column to the Greek columns framing him at the Democratic convention. [...] it carried into his presidency, from his posture of philosopher-king adjudicating between America's sins and the world's to his speeches marked by a spectacularly promiscuous use of the first-person pronoun -- I. Notice, too, how Obama habitually refers to Cabinet members and other high government officials as my -- my secretary of homeland security, my national security team, my ambassador.\n

Full text: Remember NASA? It once represented to the world the apogee of American scientific and technological achievement. Here is President Barack Obama's vision of NASA's mission, as explained by administrator Charles Bolden:
"One was he wanted me to help re-inspire children to want to get into science and math; he wanted me to expand our international relationships; and third and perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science and math and engineering."
Apart from the psychobabble -- farcically turning a space-faring enterprise into a self-esteem enhancer -- what's the sentiment behind this charge? Sure America has put a man on the moon, led the information revolution, won more Nobel Prizes than any other nation by far -- but, on the other hand, a thousand years ago al-Khwarizmi gave us algebra.
Bolden seems quite intent on driving home this message of achievement equivalence -- lauding, for example, Russia's contribution to the space station. Russia? In the 1990s, the Russian space program fell apart, leaving the United States to pick up the slack and the tab for the missing Russian contributions to get the space station built.
For good measure, Bolden added that the U.S. cannot get to Mars without international assistance. Beside the fact that this is not true, contrast this with the elan and self-confidence of President John F. Kennedy's pledge that America would land on the moon within the decade.
There was no finer expression of belief in American exceptionalism than Kennedy's. Obama has a different take. As he said last year in Strasbourg, France, "I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism." Which of course means: If we're all exceptional, no one is.
Take human rights. After Obama's meeting with the president of Kazakhstan, Michael McFaul of the National Security Council reported that Obama actually explained to the leader of that thuggish kleptocracy that we too are working on perfecting our own democracy.
Nor is this the only example of an implied moral equivalence that diminishes and devalues America. Assistant Secretary of State Michael Posner reported that in discussions with China about human rights, the U.S. side brought up Arizona's immigration law -- "early and often." As if there is the remotest connection between that and the persecution of dissidents, suppression of religion and jailing of opponents routinely practiced by the Chinese dictatorship.
Nothing new here. In his major addresses, Obama's modesty about his own country has been repeatedly on display as, in one venue after another, he has gratuitously confessed America's alleged failing -- from disrespecting foreigners to having lost its way morally after 9/11.
It's fine to recognize the achievements of others and be non-chauvinistic about one's country. But Obama's modesty is curiously selective. When it comes to himself, modesty is in short supply.
It began with the almost comical self-inflation of his presidential campaign, from the still inexplicable mass rally in Berlin in front of a Prussian victory column to the Greek columns framing him at the Democratic convention. And it carried into his presidency, from his posture of philosopher-king adjudicating between America's sins and the world's to his speeches marked by a spectacularly promiscuous use of the first-person pronoun -- I.
Notice, too, how Obama habitually refers to Cabinet members and other high government officials as "my" -- "my secretary of homeland security," "my national security team," "my ambassador." The more normal -- and respectful -- usage is to say "the," as in "the secretary of state."
It's a stylistic detail, but quite revealing of Obama's exalted view of himself. Not surprising, perhaps, in a man whose major achievement before acceding to the presidency was writing two biographies -- both about himself.
Obama is not the first president with a large streak of narcissism. But the others had equally expansive feelings about their country.
Obama's modesty about America would be more understandable if he treated himself with the same reserve. What is odd is to have a president so convinced of his own magnificence -- yet not of his own country's.

Abstract: U.S. officials are still investigating al Shabaab's claims. "Since al Shabaab issued threats against Uganda just last week, and is now taking credit for this heinous attack, they are obviously at the top of the list of prime suspects," a U.S. counterterrorism official said.

Al Qaeda-backed Somali militants took their local fight abroad Sunday, attacking a regional symbol of stability, prosperity and secularism and raising fears of a spreading terrorist threat in East Africa.
The death toll from three bombings in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, rose to at least 76 Monday. At least 11 foreigners, including one American, were among the casualties in attacks that hit an Ethiopian restaurant, a rugby club and a packed pub while crowds were gathered Sunday night to watch the final match of soccer's World Cup. At least 70 people were injured, among them six members of a Pennsylvania church group.
The Somali Islamist militant group al Shabaab took responsibility for the bombing Monday. Ugandan officials also said the group, which has warned it would attack African nations, such as Uganda, that have contributed forces to a peacekeeping effort in Somalia backing the government there.
U.S. officials are still investigating al Shabaab's claims. "Since al Shabaab issued threats against Uganda just last week, and is now taking credit for this heinous attack, they are obviously at the top of the list of prime suspects," a U.S. counterterrorism official said.
President Barack Obama called Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Monday to offer condolences and U.S. assistance, a White House spokesman said. The U.S. said the Federal Bureau of Investigation will help Ugandan police investigate.
Sunday's attacks pose a challenge to a continent that has struggled to police and pacify its own hot spots. The U.S. pulled out of Somalia in 1994, after encountering fierce resistance that was depicted in the movie "Black Hawk Down." United Nations peacekeepers followed. After U.S. backed-Ethiopian forces invaded the country to drive out Islamist forces in 2007, Uganda was the first country to respond to the U.N.'s call for an African peacekeeping force to step in.
With such moves, Uganda, buoyed by an emerging middle class, newly discovered oil reserves and flows of foreign tourists, has adopted a regional role.
President Museveni vowed to fight back. "We shall defeat them as we have done in the past," he said. "This is a cowardly act of terrorists. If they want to fight, why don't they go for the army?"
Ugandan police on Monday discovered an unexploded bomb in a popular entertainment district in a suburb of Kampala, saying it appeared to be a related attack. The device, left at the Hakuna Matata bar late Sunday evening, featured an explosive connected to a cellphone.
On Monday night the city streets of Kampala, a small, hilly city of roughly 1.5 million people, were bustling with traffic, and most shops and restaurants remained open. But many feared reprisal attacks against Somalis living in Uganda, where the government has maintained a liberal immigration policy for Somalis.
Callers to a local radio show Monday night vented their anger at Somali immigrants. "Fifty more [Somalis] come in every day," one caller shouted. "And they have a two-week visa but stay for years. Why does our government let this happen?"
Uganda has said it remains committed to the African Union peacekeeping mission in Mogadishu, to which it contributes half of the 6,000 African troops.
Uganda is also hosting a yearlong European Union training mission for Somali government troops to help in their effort to beat back Islamist militants in the capital. It is scheduled to host a summit of African Union leaders in Kampala this month, a meeting that--if it goes forward-- will likely touch on ways to curb the threats coming from Somalia.
For weeks, al Shabaab had threatened the Uganda government to force it to withdraw peacekeeping troops from Somalia. The militants renewed those threats last week, after East African nations, including Uganda, pledged to send 2,000 more troops to Somalia.
The attack illustrates how Africa's own peacekeepers have struggled to stabilize the strife-torn and clan-riven country. The Somali government controls only a section of the capital, with much of the country under the sway of al Shabaab, clans, other militants and pirates.
The al Shabaab insurgency rose to its height during the Ethiopian occupation of Somalia from 2006-08, when it won popular support and funding from wealthy Somalis for waging a guerrilla war against Ethiopian troops. The attack in Kampala, with a strike at an Ethiopian restaurant, marks an effort by al Shabaab to hit at that foe.
The militant group had vowed to attack "infidels" in Kenya for training Somali soldiers, and Uganda and Burundi for their contributions to the peacekeeping force, known as Amisom. Other nations supporting Amisom have been less open about their contributions, for fear of local opposition and reprisal.
Al Shabaab is "sending a message: Don't come here propping up the Somalia government," said Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa analyst in Nairobi for the International Crisis Group. "It's a message of deterrence."
Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, who has been on the front lines of the latest government military offensive against al Shabaab, has been trying to maintain support of neighboring countries to help buttress what remains a fragile government protected by a weak and poorly paid collection of security forces.While Uganda had been threatened by al Shabaab, it was less prepared for such an attack than other nations in East Africa. After the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed by miliants in 1998, Kenya has tightened security at major buildings, worked more closely with the U.S. on counterterrorism, and more carefully patrolled the porous border it shares with Somalia, through which possible militants could easily slip. Ethiopia, with U.S. support, is adept at protecting its borders.Muslims make up a minority of the population in Uganda, and it hasn't been considered a hotbed of Islamic radicalism or been as closely watched by international intelligence agencies in comparison to Muslim communities on the east coasts of Kenya and Tanzania.
Ugandan police issued a letter to area hotels two weeks ago urging them to improve security due to a bomb threat. Police spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba said it was a standard procedure and not related to any specific anticipated attack.
"We regularly issue messages for hotel owners about screening methods, etc.," Ms. Nabakooba said. "Terrorism threats have been on all the time, we knew they could attack public places."
She said the police would issue new security warnings to businesses this week.
On Sunday, tourist-heavy crowds had gathered in front of televisions in Kampala to watch the World Cup finals. "Most people who died were just in front of me," says Ugandan musician Bebe Cool, who was performing at the rugby club. "The blast was so loud--the next thing I saw were body parts flying over."

Full text: Major League Baseball is preparing to host its All-Star game Tuesday, and roughly one-third of the players who will be in Anaheim are African American and Latino. Hispanic and African American players typically make up a third of all those playing major-league ball, with hundreds more in the minors. Given the diversity of today's game, it is especially frustrating that baseball Commissioner Bud Selig remains silent about the nightmare next year's All-Star game could pose for millions of Americans.
Major League Baseball is scheduled to play its 2011 All-Star Game in Phoenix, where discrimination and racial profiling will effectively be sanctioned by SB1070, Arizona's controversial new immigration law. Unless the league acts, next year our favorite all-stars could enter a hostile environment, and the families, friends and fans of a third of the players could be treated as second-class citizens because of their skin color or the way they speak.
This law isn't about solving the immigration issue; it's about scapegoating, an established practice in Arizona. For years, law enforcement agencies have criticized the Maricopa County sheriff's office for not serving felony arrest warrants in favor of conducting "saturation" sweeps in which hundreds of Latinos have been indiscriminately arrested in order to find undocumented immigrants. Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon has stated that "citizens are being stopped because they are brown," and in a letter to the Justice Department he asked for a federal investigation into Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio based on his "pattern and practice of conduct that includes discriminatory harassment, improper stops, searches, and arrests." And this was before SB1070 became law.
What is happening in Arizona is a regression from the freedoms we hold dear and a violation of our civil rights and fundamental values. We are not asking Selig to weigh in on immigration policy; we are asking him to take a stand against bigotry and intolerance. Despite being petitioned by numerous members of Congress and civil rights, labor and social justice groups, Selig has not adequately addressed the issue.
Thanks to the clause in the league constitution that directs the commissioner to act in the "best interests of Major League Baseball," Selig has enormous latitude in taking steps to preserve the integrity of the game. He should recall key moments from our shared history: It was in the best interests of baseball that led MLB in 1947 to defy widespread bigotry and the institutionalized racism of Jim Crow laws and sign Jackie Robinson, finally integrating the game.
Surely the "best interests of baseball" include protecting players and millions of fans of color, not allowing MLB to be perceived as condoning blatant discrimination and injustice, and taking a stand for fairness, equality and other values that Americans and baseball hold dear. Selig should stand up for these players, these fans and these values.
Such a move would not be unprecedented. The NCAA does not allow post-season events, such as the Final Four, to occur in states that fly the Confederate flag. Years ago the NFL stood up to Arizona over its refusal to recognize the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday and moved the 1993 Super Bowl. Those sports institutions defended their players and fans, even though there was no direct threat to their safety. The Arizona law, however, is a direct threat, and Selig ought to take action.
If MLB wants to maintain the right to call baseball America's favorite pastime, and preserve the legacy of Jackie Robinson, the All-Star game should not go to Phoenix next year. Commissioner, for the sake of baseball players and millions of fans, move the game.
Wade Henderson is president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Janet Murguia is president and chief executive of the National Council of La Raza, the largest U.S. Latino civil rights and advocacy organization.

Haitians to get more time to apply to stay in U.S.; Deadline for some displaced by earthquake is extended to January

Full text: Jeff Jn Charles had, for months, been nervous about leaving the house. He feared that he'd be sent back to Haiti if someone discovered he had no identification. But one day this month, he sat in the Eglise Baptiste Du Calvaire, a Haitian church in Adelphi, proudly holding up his new Maryland identification card.
"I have an ID," he said, smiling. "Now, I can say, 'I'm Jeff.' "
Jn Charles, 25, is one of 35,005 Haitians who have received temporary protected status (TPS) since the Jan. 12 earthquake in their homeland. The program allows those who can prove they have lived continuously in the United States since that date to remain in the country legally for 18 months, regardless of their status when they applied.
On Monday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services plans to announce that it will extend the July 20 registration deadline to Jan. 18. About 70,000 to 100,000 Haitians are eligible; as of Friday, 55,786 had applied. Most live in Florida and New York. As of June, 1,407 people in the Washington area had applied.
"The registration pace has been slower than expected," said Alejandro Mayorkas, director of the immigration service.
Barriers include the difficulty of obtaining necessary documents from Haiti, the $470 application fee and a fear that signing up could lead to deportation. Those applying for TPS tend to be in the United States illegally or on visas that are set to expire.
The program is not a path to citizenship or permanent residency, but it offers people like Jn Charles a way to work and live in the country without fear of deportation.
In Port-au-Prince, Jn Charles was a business student. He arrived in the United States last year on a medical visa to seek treatment for an eye injury. The visa expired in November, but he stayed in his uncle's Silver Spring home to continue treatment. He was, Jn Charles said, afraid all the time.
"Living without papers is very difficult, very stressful," he said. "I couldn't go out, I couldn't even drive, I couldn't even have an ID, I couldn't safely walk on the street. If there's a police officer who might ask me for my papers, you were afraid. And you don't want to confront the situation." Jn Charles didn't dare look for work.
On Jan. 12, the life he had left behind in Haiti collapsed in crushed concrete and steel. Like many Haitians in the United States, he waited anxiously for news. When the dust cleared he learned that his school, his church, and many of his friends and family members had disappeared under the rubble.
After the earthquake, Haitians who were already in the United States became eligible for TPS, making Haiti the first country to become eligible since Sudan in 2004.
USCIS and community organizations held information sessions, helped people apply for fee waivers and warned them about scammers offering "help" filling out the forms. Mayorkas said that 92 percent of fee-waiver applications are being granted and that TPS "should be a source of comfort rather than a source of fear."
Still, at the Caribbean Help Center in Silver Spring, only about half of eligible Haitians have applied, the Rev. Evans Faustin said. Besides balking at the fees, he said, "they're afraid it's going to end. They're afraid it's a way for [immigration authorities] to get their name and information."
Faustin said he has tried to convince them otherwise: "It's a really good thing; I firmly believe so. That's why I encourage all the people, 'You never know, so go ahead, take the chance.' I have seen so many lives change, especially for young people."
Faustin said one woman had been in the United States illegally for 10 or 15 years and was in deportation proceedings when she applied and got a work permit.
"Now she's working," he said. "She has a Social Security number, which she wanted for so long."
The status could extend for years if previous disasters are any indication. Nicaraguans, Salvadorans and Hondurans, who received TPS after natural disasters dating as far back as 1999, continue to have theirs extended, and an 18-month extension for Salvadorans was announced Friday.
Each extension requires a new application from TPS holders.
The Rev. Jean St. Ulme, pastor at Eglise Baptiste Du Calvaire and Jn Charles's uncle, said Haiti remains in such disarray that it is unlikely to be able to accept repatriation of its nationals anytime soon.
"Definitely it should be extended, because Haiti will not be good even 10 years from now," he said. "So there's no way they can give it now and then next year say, 'You have to go back to your country.' "

Joanie Madden, an All- Ireland champion flutist and the leader of the popular Irish traditional ensemble Cherish the Ladies, is unstinting in her praise of Mike Rafferty. "He is one of my heroes and one of the greatest players ever to breathe life into a flute," she said. "He embodies all that is good about Irish traditional music, and I can think of no one more deserving of this prestigious award."
The award to which she refers is the National Endowment for the Arts' National Heritage Fellowship, the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. government on folk and traditional artists. Since they began in 1982, these fellowships have been given to 358 artists of exceptional skill, achievement and cultural significance in the U.S.
Until Mr. Rafferty won his this year, only 10 Irish artists had received one: singer Joe Heaney in 1982, uilleann piper Joe Shannon in 1983, fiddler and teacher Martin Mulvihill in 1984, stepdancer Michael Flatley in 1988, flutist Jack Coen in 1991, fiddler Liz Carroll in 1994, stepdancer Donny Golden in 1995, singer and multi- instrumentalist Mick Moloney in 1999, fiddler Kevin Burke in 2002, and button accordionist Joe Derrane in 2004. "I'm still a little shocked that I would be joining that list," Mr. Rafferty said by phone from his home in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J.
The fourth of seven children, Mr. Rafferty was born in the small rural village of Larraga, Ireland, in the parish of Ballinakill, East Galway. At age 7 he learned tin whistle from an uncle, and at age 12 he learned how to play the wooden flute from his father, Thomas. "His nickname was 'Barrel' because people thought he could fill a barrel with wind," the younger Mr. Rafferty said. The musically precocious son also mastered the uilleann pipes and Jew's harp, and became adept at lilting (akin to scatting in jazz).
East Galway is known for its fluid, lyrical, melodically pulsing but unhurried traditional music, and that style typifies Mr. Rafferty's own playing. "Fast music is like fast talk," he said. "You can't understand it."
Amid so much ardent music was an arduous life. Mr. Rafferty grew up in a thatched cottage with no electricity, gas or running water, and he worked on his family's farm as well as on the farms of neighbors. "I used horses, plow, shovel and pick, and I also cut turf for fuel," he said. "It was all hand labor. Later, for the Land Commission, I dug ditches and drains, using sticks of gelignite to blast out large rocks. The money wasn't great, but it kept us alive."
Immigrating to the U.S. in 1949, Mr. Rafferty first worked as a gardener in Purchase, N.Y., and later loaded trucks at a supermarket warehouse in Carlstadt, N.J. Occasionally he supplemented that income by bartending. Working two jobs, raising a family of five children with his wife, Teresa, and finding scarce opportunity or encouragement to play Irish traditional music at the level he preferred, however, resulted in a 10-year break from music for Mr. Rafferty.
In New York, flutists Mike Preston and Mr. Coen and button accordionists Joe Madden and SeÃ¡n McGlynn coaxed Mr. Rafferty into playing again. "I switched to a silver flute and started to attend sessions with a tape recorder so I could later practice the music I heard," he said. "Technique and tunes started to come back to me."
Unable to read or write music, Mr. Rafferty has an uncannily good melodic ear. "I have to have a feeling for a tune, and a tune has to have a feeling for me, something that makes me want to learn it in the worst way, which is often the best way," he said.
Not everyone welcomed his music, however. "Jack Coen and I each had a tin whistle when we walked into this Irish pub in the Bronx, and people inside asked us to play some tunes, which we did," he remembered. "After a while the bartender came over to us and said, 'If you don't stop that, you'll have to leave.' He wanted his customers to put money into the jukebox and listen to that, not us. So Jack and I left. But I told Jack that someday there will be Irish traditional music played live in that pub, and I was right."
The first two albums to feature Mr. Rafferty's adroit flute playing were "Irish Traditional Instrumental Music from the East Coast of America" in 1977 and "Light Through the Leaves" in 1983. Two years later, he recorded with his talented button-accordion-playing daughter Mary on "Fathers and Daughters," an album of nine different father-daughter combinations testifying to the rise of gifted young women within the once male dominion of Irish music. "It's a special moment when your child falls in love with the same music you fell in love with," Mr. Rafferty said of Mary, who was a member of Cherish the Ladies for nearly eight years.
In 1989 Mike Rafferty retired from supermarket work and switched back to a wooden flute. He taught music to beginners in his home and instructs advanced pupils there today. "A student of mine comes to me once a month from Pennsylvania," he said, "and Lesl Harker still comes to me every Tuesday." Ms. Harker did more than hone technique and learn tunes from him. She transcribed and compiled 600 of them in two books, "300 Tunes from Mike Rafferty" in 2005 and "Second Wind: 300 More Tunes from Mike Rafferty" in 2008.
At 68, Mr. Rafferty launched into a recording phase of rare distinction. From 1995 to 2009, he made or guested on nine albums, including three acclaimed duets with Mary and his own impressive solo debut, "Speed 78," issued in 2004 at age 78.
Last year, Mike Rafferty released what is arguably his finest album to date, "The New Broom," made with fiddler Willie Kelly and guitar and bouzouki player DÃ³nal Clancy, son of the late Liam Clancy and husband of Mike's daughter Mary. In his back-cover blurb for the album, button accordionist Joe Burke praises it as "the old genuine music of Ireland."
It is beautiful music, it is absolutely genuine, and it is definitively Irish, but it is not old. Nothing this vital can ever be deemed old.

Full text: Author: Bryan Gruley
MARQUETTE, Mich.--One morning last July, a Russian-made military plane landed at an airport near this Lake Superior town.
Nine men with foreign accents disembarked. Some went off to eat and shop. When they returned, a flock of federal agents and local police were waiting. Five men were taken to jail.
The plane, an Ilyushin IL-78, had come from Texas, bound for Pakistan. "All of us were trying to figure out what they were picking up or smuggling," says Cheryl Hill, assistant prosecutor of Marquette County. Capt. David Lemire of the Marquette County Sheriff's Office says, "People to this day still ask, 'What's up with that plane?"'
Not much. Nearly a year later, the 231-ton Cold War leftover remains at Sawyer International Airport, leaking fuel and luring birds.
It's an albatross of sorts for this Upper Peninsula county, which owns the airport and went months without being paid almost $4,000 for storage and maintenance.
Ms. Hill and others here still aren't sure why the plane wound up in their backyard, but now, she says, "I can't get rid of the damn thing."
The Soviet Union used similar Ilyushins in its 1980s war with Afghanistan. The tankers are equipped to refuel jets in midair and can be converted for carrying cargo or fighting fires.
The aircraft stranded in Michigan was built in 1988, says Gary Fears, a Boca Raton, Fla., entrepreneur whose family trust controls Air Support Systems LLC, which bought the Ilyushin for about $4 million in 2005.
Mr. Fears, 64 years old, has helped develop casinos in Illinois and Florida and has been involved in real-estate development, steak houses and an auto-body repair business. He envisioned retooling the Ilyushin for fire fighting after living in fire-ravaged California in the early 2000s.
The plane is "breathtaking in terms of its capabilities," he says, adding that it can spread fire retardant "across five football fields in one pass."
The plane sat idle at a Grayson County, Texas, airport for three years without a job. Last year, North American Tactical Aviation Inc., a privately held concern in Newark, Del., that buys and sells used military aircraft, leased the plane.
NATA planned to fly it to Pakistan and court the military as a customer, company president Dwight Barnell says.
On July 16 last year, the Federal Aviation Administration granted a "ferry permit" for the plane to leave Texas. The next morning, the Ilyushin took off with a crew of Ukrainians and others hired by NATA.
Originally, the plane was to fly directly to Iceland and stop briefly before proceeding to Pakistan. But it left Texas without securing U.S. Customs and Border Protection permission to leave the country. It stopped in Michigan to finalize that, Mr. Barnell says.
The Ilyushin landed on Sawyer's 2.3-mile-long runway, set amid vast stands of jack pine. The airport, about 17 miles south of Marquette, is itself a Cold War relic, a former Air Force base built in the 1950s to defend against Soviet attack. Budget cuts closed it in 1995, but it reopened as a commercial airport and today handles about 400 flights a month.
Airport officials snapped photographs as the Ilyushin swooped in. The crew had called ahead to order more than $45,000 of fuel.
A different call came to the county Sheriff's Office: A Texas lawyer claimed the Iluyshin had been stolen, police say. Documents showed a Texas judge had ordered the plane grounded because Mr. Fears' company owed $62,400 to a maintenance firm for fuel, repairs and storage at the Texas airport.
Mr. Fears disputes owing anything to the firm, Air-1 Flight Support Inc., and says he and the crew were unaware of the judge's order.
Air-1 owner Victor Miller says he informed Mr. Fears and the crew of the order. After the plane left Texas, Mr. Miller tracked it on the Internet and had his lawyer call Michigan. "If that airplane left the country, I was never going to get anything out of it," he says.
Up in Michigan, Ms. Hill, the prosecutor, told police they lacked jurisdiction; the plane could buy fuel and go. But most of the crew had scattered to nearby stores and restaurants.
Chatting with two crew members who spoke English, Sheriff's Detective Lt. Stephen Kangas learned the plane was going to Pakistan. But the men weren't clear on what they planned to do there, Lt. Kangas says. He called the local FBI.
Soon the airport was swarming with agents from the FBI, FAA and Transportation Security Administration, while Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents drove over from Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.
Inside the plane, police saw gauges marked in Cyrillic script, packages of ramen noodles, an American flag and a stringer of dried fish. Nero the drug-sniffing dog found nothing illegal.
Sometime after midnight, Customs Enforcement agents cuffed five Ukrainian crew members and took them to jail for having expired visas. Several days later, the men were allowed to return to Ukraine. The others, including two U.S. citizens, left town.
Efforts to interview the crew members were unsuccessful.
At the airport, gawkers cruised the perimeter seeking a glimpse of the plane. One man wrote on a television news website, "I wonder how these bozos can have free access to U.S. airspace with a heavy aircraft, and I am not allowed a few simple carry-on items?"
While the feds investigated, a Marquette County Circuit judge and Customs and Border Protection separately ordered the plane held. Workers blocked it with dump trucks and a snowplow. When fuel started leaking from the wings, Ms. Hill worried winter snow and ice might collapse a wing and cause a costly spill.
Customs and Border Protection released the plane in February and fined Mr. Fears' company $2,500 for lacking a license to take the plane out of the country. The Marquette judge awarded the Ilyushin to Air-1, the Texas maintenance firm.
Last Friday, Mr. Fears' attorneys asked the judge to put yet another hold on the plane, alleging Air-1's Mr. Miller recently sold it to Temco Industries Inc. of Wilmington, Del., for $60,000, "a fraction of what the Aircraft is worth." Temco couldn't be reached; Mr. Miller didn't respond to calls or emails Monday.
Starlings are nesting in the Ilyushin's tail and pigeons flutter in and out of an engine. Ms. Hill says she'd love to see the plane leave Michigan, although, "If they want to donate it to us, we'll take it."

Full text: A Guatemalan woman who argued in an asylum case that she would be in danger if she were to be returned to her native country because of the high rate of murders of women there can have her case reviewed, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday.
The court sent the case back to the Board of Immigration Appeals to consider whether Guatemalan women make up a "social group" and whether some should be eligible for asylum based on that. In the ruling, the court also ordered the board to determine whether Lesly Yajayra Perdomo has demonstrated a fear of persecution based on her membership in that group.
To obtain asylum, applicants must show that they are unable or unwilling to return home because of persecution or fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.
Her attorney, Alan Hutchison, said he was "immensely pleased" by the ruling. He added that Perdomo's sister, Zulema, also had her case remanded back to the Board of Immigration Appeals for reconsideration.
"This is a landmark case in immigration law," he said. "It really opens up the definition of a particular social group."
Perdomo sneaked into the United States in 1991 to join her mother in Reno, where she now works as a Medicaid account executive.
In 2003, Perdomo appeared in immigration court and argued that she should receive asylum because she feared persecution, citing widespread violence against women in Guatemala, according to the ruling. She presented evidence about the torture and killing of women and the lack of response from the Guatemalan government.
The immigration court and the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that "all women in Guatemala" or those between 14 and 40 years of age was too broad to qualify as a protected social group.
The 9th Circuit judges disagreed and said that they had previously determined that Gypsies, homosexuals and Somali woman facing genital mutilation made up social groups for purposes of asylum.
"What is most momentous about this is that the 9th Circuit is emboldening judges and trial lawyers who appear in immigration courts to make the case that women are capable of being a social group," said Bruce Einhorn, a former immigration judge who directs the asylum and refugee clinic at Pepperdine University School of Law. "It is not a guarantee, but it is an invitation to make that argument."
Einhorn said he didn't believe that the ruling opened the door to all women from a country experiencing a crime wave.

Full text: Harvey Pekar 1939-2010
Harvey Pekar spooled out his drab existence as a file clerk struggling to survive petty reverses in a series of comic books.
With searing honesty and mordant wit, Mr. Pekar, who died at age 70, transformed his life's struggles into something worthy of the series title "American Splendor."
Mr. Pekar was found dead at his suburban Cleveland home by police responding to a 1 a.m. Monday call from his wife, Joyce Brabner, the Associated Press reported. An autopsy was planned. He had suffered from multiple health problems in recent years.
An earlier bout with lymphoma was the subject for "Our Cancer Year," the 1990 graphic memoir he wrote, illustrated by Ms. Brabner.
"He was the original blogger," said Dean Haspiel, a comics artist who collaborated with Mr. Pekar on "The Quitter," a hardcover autobiography released in 2005.
Mr. Pekar did not draw. Instead, he relied on a stable of top comics artists, most notably R.Crumb, to illustrate his tales, which originally appeared in 1976 as self-published comic books. After Mr. Pekar became an occasional guest of David Letterman in the 1980s, his fame and his comics franchise grew.
The first issue of "American Splendor," subtitled "From off the streets of Cleveland," appeared with a cover by Mr. Crumb. Subsequent issues conveyed Mr. Pekar's car problems, spats and reconciliations with his wife, and conflicts at his job as a file clerk in a Cleveland hospital. The common theme was struggle, the atmosphere bleak, Mr. Pekar a mercurial presence. The "Splendor" on the cover was nowhere to be found inside.
"The autobiographical emphasis on everyday life was unique, especially a working-class life" said Joseph Witek, an English Professor and comics historian at Stetson University in Deland, Fla.
In 2003, "American Splendor" became a film starring Paul Giamatti as Mr. Pekar. More recently, Mr. Pekar completed histories of Students for a Democratic Society and the beat movement in comics form, and also a jazz opera, "Leave Me Alone!"
A native of Cleveland, Mr. Pekar was the son of Polish immigrants, ardent Zionists.
A single issue of "American Splendor" might feature a half-dozen stories drawn by as many artists, providing multiple perspectives though the writer was always Mr. Pekar.
The publicity surrounding the film "American Splendor" became the inspiration for Mr. Pekar's next work, "Our Film Year." The most recent "American Splendor" appeared in 2008, now published by DC Comics, home to such superheroes as Batman and Wonder Woman.
"The reason I got into comic books was so little had been done with the form," Mr. Pekar told the Vancouver Sun in 2004.
"It was as good an art form as any that existed, it's just that for some reason people didn't want to write adult stories."

Full text: Joanie Madden, an All-Ireland champion flutist and the leader of the popular Irish traditional ensemble Cherish the Ladies, is unstinting in her praise of Mike Rafferty. "He is one of my heroes and one of the greatest players ever to breathe life into a flute," she said. "He embodies all that is good about Irish traditional music, and I can think of no one more deserving of this prestigious award."
The award to which she refers is the National Endowment for the Arts' National Heritage Fellowship, the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. government on folk and traditional artists. Since they began in 1982, these fellowships have been given to 358 artists of exceptional skill, achievement and cultural significance in the U.S.
Until Mr. Rafferty won his this year, only 10 Irish artists had received one: singer Joe Heaney in 1982, uilleann piper Joe Shannon in 1983, fiddler and teacher Martin Mulvihill in 1984, stepdancer Michael Flatley in 1988, flutist Jack Coen in 1991, fiddler Liz Carroll in 1994, stepdancer Donny Golden in 1995, singer and multi-instrumentalist Mick Moloney in 1999, fiddler Kevin Burke in 2002, and button accordionist Joe Derrane in 2004. "I'm still a little shocked that I would be joining that list," Mr. Rafferty said by phone from his home in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J.
The fourth of seven children, Mr. Rafferty was born in the small rural village of Larraga, Ireland, in the parish of Ballinakill, East Galway. At age 7 he learned tin whistle from an uncle, and at age 12 he learned how to play the wooden flute from his father, Thomas. "His nickname was 'Barrel' because people thought he could fill a barrel with wind," the younger Mr. Rafferty said. The musically precocious son also mastered the uilleann pipes and Jew's harp, and became adept at lilting (akin to scatting in jazz).
East Galway is known for its fluid, lyrical, melodically pulsing but unhurried traditional music, and that style typifies Mr. Rafferty's own playing. "Fast music is like fast talk," he said. "You can't understand it."
Amid so much ardent music was an arduous life. Mr. Rafferty grew up in a thatched cottage with no electricity, gas or running water, and he worked on his family's farm as well as on the farms of neighbors. "I used horses, plow, shovel and pick, and I also cut turf for fuel," he said. "It was all hand labor. Later, for the Land Commission, I dug ditches and drains, using sticks of gelignite to blast out large rocks. The money wasn't great, but it kept us alive."
Immigrating to the U.S. in 1949, Mr. Rafferty first worked as a gardener in Purchase, N.Y., and later loaded trucks at a supermarket warehouse in Carlstadt, N.J. Occasionally he supplemented that income by bartending. Working two jobs, raising a family of five children with his wife, Teresa, and finding scarce opportunity or encouragement to play Irish traditional music at the level he preferred, however, resulted in a 10-year break from music for Mr. Rafferty.
In New York, flutists Mike Preston and Mr. Coen and button accordionists Joe Madden and Sean McGlynn coaxed Mr. Rafferty into playing again. "I switched to a silver flute and started to attend sessions with a tape recorder so I could later practice the music I heard," he said. "Technique and tunes started to come back to me."
Unable to read or write music, Mr. Rafferty has an uncannily good melodic ear. "I have to have a feeling for a tune, and a tune has to have a feeling for me, something that makes me want to learn it in the worst way, which is often the best way," he said.
Not everyone welcomed his music, however. "Jack Coen and I each had a tin whistle when we walked into this Irish pub in the Bronx, and people inside asked us to play some tunes, which we did," he remembered. "After a while the bartender came over to us and said, 'If you don't stop that, you'll have to leave.' He wanted his customers to put money into the jukebox and listen to that, not us. So Jack and I left. But I told Jack that someday there will be Irish traditional music played live in that pub, and I was right."
The first two albums to feature Mr. Rafferty's adroit flute playing were "Irish Traditional Instrumental Music from the East Coast of America" in 1977 and "Light Through the Leaves" in 1983. Two years later, he recorded with his talented button-accordion-playing daughter Mary on "Fathers and Daughters," an album of nine different father-daughter combinations testifying to the rise of gifted young women within the once male dominion of Irish music. "It's a special moment when your child falls in love with the same music you fell in love with," Mr. Rafferty said of Mary, who was a member of Cherish the Ladies for nearly eight years.
In 1989 Mike Rafferty retired from supermarket work and switched back to a wooden flute. He taught music to beginners in his home and instructs advanced pupils there today. "A student of mine comes to me once a month from Pennsylvania," he said, "and Lesl Harker still comes to me every Tuesday." Ms. Harker did more than hone technique and learn tunes from him. She transcribed and compiled 600 of them in two books, "300 Tunes from Mike Rafferty" in 2005 and "Second Wind: 300 More Tunes from Mike Rafferty" in 2008.
At 68, Mr. Rafferty launched into a recording phase of rare distinction. From 1995 to 2009, he made or guested on nine albums, including three acclaimed duets with Mary and his own impressive solo debut, "Speed 78," issued in 2004 at age 78.
Last year, Mike Rafferty released what is arguably his finest album to date, "The New Broom," made with fiddler Willie Kelly and guitar and bouzouki player Donal Clancy, son of the late Liam Clancy and husband of Mike's daughter Mary. In his back-cover blurb for the album, button accordionist Joe Burke praises it as "the old genuine music of Ireland."
It is beautiful music, it is absolutely genuine, and it is definitively Irish, but it is not old. Nothing this vital can ever be deemed old.

Full text: If it is unconstitutional and odious for state and local cops to enforce federal immigration laws, then why hasn't the Obama administration sued dozens of Chicago collar counties and towns to stop them from doing it?
Suburban counties and some major suburbs here check the immigration status of anyone who has been booked, even for minor crimes. Even more surprising, this is done under the blessing and encouragement of ... the Obama administration. The so-called 287(g) program allows local law enforcement agencies to check the immigration status through an extensive Department of Homeland Security database of anyone who has been incarcerated and to hold anyone who has an immigration problem.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement calls the program, authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act, just "one component under (an) umbrella of services and programs offered for assistance to local law enforcement officers." ICE says the program allows state and local law enforcement agencies to give federal agencies valuable assistance by preventing "criminal aliens" from being released back into the community.
Nationally, at least 67 state and local law enforcement agencies have signed up for the controversial program, including those in Lake, McHenry, DuPage, Will and Kane counties, and the department hopes to expand it nationwide in three years.
So, obviously, the idea of state and local cops helping enforce federal immigration laws is not in itself unconstitutional in the eyes of the Obama administration. Then why is it suing Arizona? The administration, to justify this obvious inconsistency, can point to a difference in the Arizona law and the 287(g) program: The latter applies to those already incarcerated. The Arizona law gives state and local police the discretion to check immigration status before arrest and incarceration.
That's not much of a difference upon which to base a constitutional challenge. But if that's the difference that the Obama administration uses to explain why it's suing Arizona but not participants in the 287(g) program, then it ought to explain why it treats Arizona and Rhode Island differently. Rhode Island handles illegal immigrants the same as would the Arizona law, but Obama is suing only Arizona. Rhode Island state troopers routinely check the immigration status of drivers who are stopped for traffic violations and other minor offenses, as would the Arizona law.
But Attorney General Eric Holder and the White House have issued no condemnations of Rhode Island. No lawsuits have been threatened or filed against Rhode Island. How can this be? Raw politics. Arizona is Republican; Rhode Island is Democratic.
The Obama administration was joined by Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter in explaining why states can't help enforce federal immigration laws: "We should not have a patchwork of immigration policy for every state. ... That's insane."
What's insane is the Obama administration's uneven and hypocritical application of the law and the 10th Amendment, which says: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people." If the federal government chooses not to exercise its powers, does it forfeit that power to states and the people? If the political party controlling Washington fails to enforce immigration laws, are states that are unduly burdened required to sit mute?
As the immigration battle illustrates, the reach of federal powers may be the country's most perplexing issue. Can a state overrule federal law by legalizing same-sex marriages? Should gun control or regulation of medicinal marijuana be a state or a federal power? Should abortion policies be set by democratic debate at the state level, as it did prior to Roe v. Wade -- the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion? Can Cook County and San Francisco establish their own immigration policies by declaring their jurisdictions "sanctuaries" for illegal immigrants?
For years, the 10th Amendment -- a part of the Bill of Rights designed to protect individuals from federal abuses -- has been regarded as the Constitution's appendix, ignored until it becomes troublesome. But the 10th Amendment can no longer be ignored. We're in for a blizzard of 10th Amendment cases, including whether the federal government can require every American to buy health insurance. Arizona is just the start.

Full text: Hmmm, so how about these federal employees who moonlight on the side? Maybe we're not keeping them busy enough? But Steven Chu, who just managed to publish yet another scientific paper while holding down his day job as U.S. secretary of energy, insists that his ongoing physics work isn't a side gig so much as it is fun.
"The first 70 or 75 hours a week absolutely go to my real job," Chu told us late last week on the phone from Texas, where he was tending to oil-spill business. "This is my hobby. Pleasure time. I could watch TV, I could go play golf -- or I could do this."
Pleasure time may not be what you want to devote to reading Chu's latest article in the journal Nature: "Subnanometre single-molecule localization, registration and distance measurements." It concerns a system that Chu and two junior colleagues devised to refine the ability of optical microscopes to detect and measure the distance between really, really, really small things going on inside biological matter -- down to the size of less than half a nanometer. The previous limit was 15 to 20 nanometers. (A human hair is about 50,000 nanometers wide.)
The work took seven or eight years, he said, most of it long before he joined the Obama team. They first submitted the paper about a year ago -- and while two reviewers loved it, he said, a third quibbled that it seemed too technical and suggested more demonstrations, which they crafted before resubmitting successfully.
So, being energy secretary doesn't get you any breaks?
"Oh, of course not. Definitely not!" Chu told us. "Having a Nobel Prize doesn't get you anywhere either." (He won his in 1997.) He added: "It's probably much more fun if you're a reviewer, and you can shoot down someone like that. That's the good thing about the review process -- they don't care who you are."
A year after she joined the Supreme Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor has signed a deal to pen a memoir for Alfred A. Knopf, the publishing house announced Monday.
Too soon? Actually, recent history suggests strong reader interest and big money in the stories of top-court pioneers and how they got there. Past Supreme Court memoirs tended to hit the market after their authors left the bench. But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's "Lazy B: Growing Up on a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest," was released in 2002, four years before the court's first female jurist retired. Focusing on her pre-SCOTUS years, it spent a few weeks on the bestseller lists and sold an impressive 87,579 copies, according to Nielsen BookScan. That sent publishers scrambling after Justice Clarence Thomas. The court's second African American justice released "My Grandfather's Son" in 2007. It has sold 206,386 copies and earned him $1.5 million, according to financial disclosures.
Like O'Connor and Thomas, Sotomayor's book will dwell on her early years, as the child of Puerto Rican immigrants who went from the South Bronx to the Ivy League -- "a triumph of the Latino experience in America," touted Knopf Doubleday Chairman Sonny Mehta in a news release. The as-yet-untitled book will be published simultaneously in a Spanish-language edition.
Beginning to think Mel Gibson might be a jerk? In the latest daily outrage, RadarOnline.com released even more tapes Monday, this time of the imploding superstar seemingly acknowledging to his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva that he hit her. Los Angeles authorities launched a domestic violence investigation last week.
"Die Hard" director John McTiernan faces up to a year in prison after pleading guilty in L.A. federal court Monday to perjury and making false statements to the FBI -- all this during the feds' investigation of Hollywood P.I. Anthony Pellicano, now serving a 15-year sentence for bugging famous people's phone lines.
Separated: Hip-hop superproducer The-Dream and singer Christina Milian, after a whirlwind 12 months in which they got engaged, wed in Vegas and had a baby. It broke down just as fast Monday: Photos emerged of him frolicking with another woman; Milian tweeted "whatever you think . . . believe it." Then he put out a statement to Us Weekly: "Terius 'The-Dream' Nash is saddened to announce that his marriage to Christina Milian was unsuccessful."

Full text: In its challenge to Arizona's controversial immigration law last week, the Justice Department argues that the state law conflicts with federal law, intruding on federal power and ability to regulate immigration. For many Americans, however, the lawsuit is needed because of concerns that Arizona's legislation, S.B. 1070, will lead to police harassment of people, particularly those of color, who cannot prove they are in this country legally. Yet for all the controversy over those concerns, few are talking about the real legal issue underlying the law.
Supporters and opponents of S.B. 1070 assume that racial profiling is unconstitutional, largely because many Americans believe that it ought to be. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court has approved the racial profiling permitted -- indeed encouraged -- by S.B. 1070.
In a 1975 case regarding the Border Patrol's power to stop vehicles near the U.S.-Mexico border and question the occupants about their citizenship and immigration status, United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, the high court ruled that the "likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor." In 1982 the Arizona Supreme Court agreed, ruling in State v. Graciano that "enforcement of immigration laws often involves a relevant consideration of ethnic factors."
Arizona's immigration law states that a "law enforcement official or agency . . . may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona constitution." Although supporters of the law, including Gov. Jan Brewer (R) and other state officials, have said repeatedly that racial profiling is prohibited in its enforcement and that those charged with carrying out the law will be trained to avoid it, the fact that the legislature included this careful exception is significant.
Lawmakers took care to embrace the reliance on race permitted by cases such as Brignoni-Ponce. This choice deserves acknowledgment and discussion, just like that received by the rest of the law.
Brignoni-Ponce has resulted in immigration enforcement that many contend is race-based and in violation of the U.S. Constitution. In case after case, in states including Florida, Iowa and New York, defendants arguing that Border Patrol stops constituted unlawful searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment have encountered claims by the U.S. government -- including the current administration -- that "Mexican" or "Hispanic" appearance, along with other factors, justified an immigration stop. Border enforcement officers regularly admit in court that "Hispanic appearance" is one reason for an immigration stop.
Racial profiling results from the perceived statistical association of particular races or nationalities with undocumented immigration -- the idea, in other words, that many undocumented immigrants are from Mexico. This rationale ignores the fact that the law generally requires individual suspicion to justify criminal investigation; that a "Mexican appearance" is a vague and ambiguous description and that people from Mexico bear an array of appearances.
We suspect that Brignoni-Ponce and its incorporation into S.B. 1070 have escaped the notice of many Americans because of the ways in which racial sensibilities have evolved since the 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. Modern American values and most of modern constitutional law are simply inconsistent with the equation of race and suspicion authorized and encouraged by Brignoni-Ponce. Today, being subject to questioning by law enforcement for no other reason than that others of your race, religion or national origin are supposed to commit more of a particular type of crime is nothing short of un-American.
The federal lawsuit raises a number of questions. We think the government's claim of federal preemption is likely to prevail: There is room for one immigration law, not a 50-state patchwork of immigration laws. But the discussion should not stop there. Perhaps that is why last Friday the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) filed another challenge focusing on S.B. 1070's potential for racial profiling. For the Arizona officials who enacted S.B. 1070, the next step is to repeal the part of the law that authorizes racial profiling. As for the legal system as a whole: Brignoni-Ponce has been exceptional and out of the constitutional mainstream since it was decided. The U.S. and Arizona Supreme Courts should reconsider the endorsement of race-based law enforcement, which is contrary to modern notions of equality in America, and conform constitutional law to the principles held dear by most Americans.

Full text: MARQUETTE, Mich. -- One morning last July, a Russian-made military plane landed at an airport near this Lake Superior town.
Nine men with foreign accents disembarked. Some went off to eat and shop. When they returned, a flock of federal agents and local police were waiting. Five men were taken to jail.
The plane, an Ilyushin IL-78, had come from Texas, bound for Pakistan. "All of us were trying to figure out what they were picking up or smuggling," says Cheryl Hill, assistant prosecutor of Marquette County. Capt. David Lemire of the Marquette County Sheriff's Office says, "People to this day still ask, 'What's up with that plane?"'
Not much. Nearly a year later, the 231-ton Cold War leftover remains at Sawyer International Airport, leaking fuel and luring birds.
It's an albatross of sorts for this Upper Peninsula county, which owns the airport and went months without being paid almost $4,000 for storage and maintenance.
Ms. Hill and others here still aren't sure why the plane wound up in their backyard, but now, she says, "I can't get rid of the damn thing."
The Soviet Union used similar Ilyushins in its 1980s war with Afghanistan. The tankers are equipped to refuel jets in midair and can be converted for carrying cargo or fighting fires.
The aircraft stranded in Michigan was built in 1988, says Gary Fears, a Boca Raton, Fla., entrepreneur whose family trust controls Air Support Systems LLC, which bought the Ilyushin for about $4 million in 2005.
Mr. Fears, 64 years old, has helped develop casinos in Illinois and Florida and has been involved in real-estate development, steak houses and an auto-body repair business. He envisioned retooling the Ilyushin for fire fighting after living in fire-ravaged California.
The plane is "breathtaking in terms of its capabilities," he says, adding that it can spread fire retardant "across five football fields in one pass."
The plane sat idle at a Grayson County, Texas, airport for three years without a job. Last year, North American Tactical Aviation Inc., a privately held concern in Newark, Del., that buys and sells used military aircraft, leased the plane.
NATA planned to fly it to Pakistan and court the military as a customer, company president Dwight Barnell says.
On July 16 last year, the Federal Aviation Administration granted a "ferry permit" for the plane to leave Texas. The next morning, the Ilyushin took off with a crew of Ukrainians and others hired by NATA.
Originally, the plane was to fly directly to Iceland and stop briefly before proceeding to Pakistan. But it left Texas without securing U.S. Customs and Border Protection permission to leave the country. It stopped in Michigan to finalize that, Mr. Barnell says.
The Ilyushin landed on Sawyer's 2.3-mile-long runway, set amid vast stands of jack pine. The airport is itself a Cold War relic, a former Air Force base built in the 1950s to defend against Soviet attack. Budget cuts closed it in 1995, but it reopened as a commercial airport and today handles about 400 flights a month.
Airport officials snapped photographs as the Ilyushin swooped in. The crew had called ahead to order more than $45,000 of fuel.
A different call came to the county Sheriff's Office: A Texas lawyer claimed the Iluyshin had been stolen, police say. Documents showed a Texas judge had ordered the plane grounded because Mr. Fears' company owed $62,400 to a maintenance firm for fuel, repairs and storage at the Texas airport.
Mr. Fears disputes owing anything to the firm, Air-1 Flight Support Inc., and says he and the crew were unaware of the judge's order.
Air-1 owner Victor Miller says he informed Mr. Fears and the crew of the order. After the plane left Texas, Mr. Miller tracked it on the Internet and had his lawyer call Michigan. "If that airplane left the country, I was never going to get anything out of it," he says.
Up in Michigan, Ms. Hill, the prosecutor, told police they lacked jurisdiction; the plane could buy fuel and go. But most of the crew had scattered to nearby stores and restaurants.
Chatting with two crew members who spoke English, Sheriff's Detective Lt. Stephen Kangas learned the plane was going to Pakistan. But the men weren't clear on what they planned to do there, Lt. Kangas says. He called the local FBI.
Soon the airport was swarming with agents from the FBI, FAA and Transportation Security Administration, while Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents drove over from Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.
Inside the plane, police saw gauges marked in Cyrillic script, packages of ramen noodles, an American flag and a stringer of dried fish. Nero the drug-sniffing dog found nothing illegal.
Sometime after midnight, Customs Enforcement agents cuffed five Ukrainian crew members and took them to jail for having expired visas. Several days later, the men were allowed to return to Ukraine. The others, including two U.S. citizens, left town.
Efforts to interview the crew members were unsuccessful.
At the airport, gawkers cruised the perimeter seeking a glimpse of the plane. One man wrote on a television news website, "I wonder how these bozos can have free access to U.S. airspace with a heavy aircraft, and I am not allowed a few simple carry-on items?"
While the feds investigated, a Marquette County Circuit judge and Customs and Border Protection separately ordered the plane held. Workers blocked it with dump trucks and a snowplow. When fuel started leaking from the wings, Ms. Hill worried snow and ice might collapse a wing and cause a costly spill.
Customs and Border Protection released the plane in February and fined Mr. Fears' company $2,500 for lacking a license to take the plane out of the country. The Marquette judge awarded the Ilyushin to Air-1, the Texas maintenance firm.
Last Friday, Mr. Fears' attorneys asked the judge to put yet another hold on the plane, alleging Air-1's Mr. Miller recently sold it to Temco Industries Inc. of Wilmington, Del., for $60,000, "a fraction of what the Aircraft is worth." Temco couldn't be reached; Mr. Miller didn't respond to calls or emails Monday.
Starlings are nesting in the Ilyushin's tail and pigeons flutter in and out of an engine. Ms. Hill says she'd love to see the plane leave Michigan, although, "If they want to donate it to us, we'll take it."

Abstract: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Alejandro Mayorkas announced the extension in Miami six months after the Jan. 12 earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people. "Since the earthquake, (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) has maintained an ongoing dialogue with Haitian community leaders and advocates, and we have heard that many Haitians need more time to apply" for temporary protected status, Mayorkas said in a statement.

Full text: U.S. offers Haitians extension
6 months after quake, more time to seek special status
MIAMI -- Registration for the temporary protected status program to help Haitians living in the United States has been extended for six months, a federal official announced Monday.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Alejandro Mayorkas announced the extension in Miami six months after the Jan. 12 earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people.
"Since the earthquake, (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) has maintained an ongoing dialogue with Haitian community leaders and advocates, and we have heard that many Haitians need more time to apply" for temporary protected status, Mayorkas said in a statement. "Extending the registration period will afford more eligible individuals a chance to remain safely in the United States at this time of crisis and devastation in Haiti."
The registration, which had been set to end July 20, will end Jan. 18, he said.
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano designated Haiti for temporary protected status for an 18-month period that began Jan. 21.
The status allows eligible Haitians to continue living in the United States as well as obtain work authorization for the duration of the program.
The designation applies to those Haitians who have lived continuously in the United States since the Jan. 12 earthquake; those Haitian nationals who first entered the United States after that date are not eligible.
More than 90 percent of applications to waive registration fees are being granted, Mayorkas said.
In the island nation's capital, Port-au-Prince, not much appears to have changed in the six months since the quake.
The government has barely begun the cleanup process. Roads in the center of the city are still blocked by debris. And some experts predict that it could take up to 20 years to remove all of the estimated 20 million cubic yards of rubble.
The U.N. estimates 1.5 million people still live in camps. That means roughly 1 in 9 Haitians are homeless.
Parades set off violent confrontation
BELFAST, Northern Ireland -- Police prepare to remove protesters in a Catholic neighborhood Monday after about 100 demonstrators blocked Protestant marchers returning from a parade. Elsewhere in the city, police fired water cannons and plastic bullets at masked youths who threw bottles, roof tiles, golf balls and bricks at them. The parade marking the defeat of Catholic forces at the Battle of Boyne in 1690 is a yearly source of friction.

3 dead after shooting at Albuquerque plant
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- A gunman targeting his live-in girlfriend opened fire at a fiber optics manufacturing plant Monday, killing two people and wounding four others before turning the weapon on himself, police say.
The gunman was identified by police as Robert Reza, 37, a former employee of Emcore Corp., where hundreds of workers fled after the shooting began shortly before 9:30 a.m.
"We believe it is a workplace domestic violence situation," Albuquerque police Chief Ray Schultz said, adding that the girlfriend, who had told co-workers that she feared for her safety, was among those wounded. The couple's two children were accounted for and safe, Schultz said.
Living legend retires
WASHINGTON -- John C. "Jack" Keeney, a living legend to generations of government lawyers during his 60 years at the Justice Department, has decided to retire at age 88.
Keeney, by far the oldest Justice Department employee, said Monday he will leave for good after 90 final days.
Keeney rose from rookie lawyer in President Harry Truman's Justice Department in 1951 to his current post of deputy assistant attorney general.
Ten years ago, Attorney General Janet Reno and her then-deputy, Eric Holder, named a Justice Department building in Washington in Keeney's honor. Most of his career has been spent fighting organized crime, and he helped with the Watergate investigation.

Britain sentences 3 in airliner plot to life in jail
Three Britons recruited as suicide bombers in an al-Qaida-inspired 2006 plot to blow up airliners as they were flying across the Atlantic Ocean were sentenced Monday to life in prison, with a minimum of 20 years.
Ibrahim Savant, 29, Arafat Waheed Khan, 29, and Waheed Zaman, 26, were convicted last week of conspiracy to murder as suicide bombers. They and other conspirators planned to detonate liquid explosives stowed aboard planes in soft-drink bottles, prosecutors said.
The foiled plot created global chaos as airports were closed and passengers stranded. New restrictions were instituted worldwide, and a ban on liquids remains in effect in most airports around the world. Twelve people have now been prosecuted in connection with the liquid bomb plot.
U.N. opens talks on rules for global arms trade
UNITED NATIONS -- The world's nations opened negotiations Monday on an arms trade treaty meant to regulate the $55 billion global weapons market and prevent guns from pouring into conflict zones and fueling wars and atrocities.
Supporters aim to set common rules for international arms sales -- from rifles to fighter planes -- to replace a patchwork of national laws riddled with loopholes that make it easy to buy weapons for conflicts.
Key issues in the negotiations will include what criteria governments will have to fulfill to get a green light for arms sales and how compliance would be monitored.
Ex-teen militant suspect says he won't take deal
GUANTANAMO BAY NAVY BASE, Cuba -- Alleged ex-teen militant Omar Khadr on Monday denounced his coming war crimes trial as a sham, saying he had been offered a secret plea deal for release after five years served at Guantanamo.
Instead, the Canadian fired his attorneys and said he would offer no defense.
"I'm representing myself and I'm boycotting," said Khadr, 23, who has grown from an adolescent captured near death in Afghanistan into manhood in U.S. military custody. Pentagon prosecutors allege that Khadr, then age 15, threw a grenade in a firefight in Afghanistan that fatally wounded a special forces medic.

Charges mount for Sudanese president
Sudan President Omar al-Bashir was the subject of a second arrest warrant issued Monday by the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands. Al-Bashir already was wanted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The three new charges of genocide for his role in a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur are in addition to the earlier ones, not instead of them, the court said.

Full text: Al Qaeda-backed Somali militants took their local fight abroad Sunday, attacking a regional symbol of stability, prosperity and secularism and raising fears of a spreading terrorist threat in East Africa.
The death toll from three bombings in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, rose to at least 76 Monday. At least 11 foreigners, including one American, were among the casualties in attacks that hit an Ethiopian restaurant, a rugby club and a packed pub while crowds were gathered Sunday night to watch the final match of soccer's World Cup. At least 70 people were injured, among them six members of a Pennsylvania church group.
The Somali Islamist militant group al Shabaab took responsibility for the bombing Monday. Ugandan officials also said the group has warned it would attack African nations, such as Uganda, that have contributed forces to a peacekeeping effort in Somalia backing the government there.
U.S. officials are still investigating al Shabaab's claims. "Since al Shabaab issued threats against Uganda just last week, and is now taking credit for this heinous attack, they are obviously at the top of the list of prime suspects," a U.S. counterterrorism official said.
President Barack Obama called Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Monday to offer condolences and U.S. assistance, a White House spokesman said. The U.S. said the Federal Bureau of Investigation will help Ugandan police investigate.
Sunday's attacks pose a challenge to a continent that has struggled to police and pacify its own hot spots. The U.S. pulled out of Somalia in 1994, after encountering fierce resistance that was depicted in the movie "Black Hawk Down." United Nations peacekeepers followed. After U.S. backed-Ethiopian forces invaded the country to drive out Islamist forces in 2007, Uganda was the first country to respond to the U.N.'s call for an African peacekeeping force to step in.
With such moves, Uganda, buoyed by an emerging middle class, newly discovered oil reserves and flows of foreign tourists, has adopted a regional role.
President Museveni vowed to fight back. "We shall defeat them as we have done in the past," he said.
Ugandan police on Monday discovered an unexploded bomb in a popular entertainment district in a suburb of Kampala, saying it appeared to be a related attack. The device, left at the Hakuna Matata bar late Sunday evening, featured an explosive connected to a cellphone.
On Monday night the city streets of Kampala, a small, hilly city of roughly 1.5 million people, were bustling with traffic, and most shops and restaurants remained open. But many feared reprisal attacks against Somalis living in Uganda, where the government has maintained a liberal immigration policy for Somalis.
Callers to a local radio show Monday night vented their anger at Somali immigrants. "Fifty more [Somalis] come in every day," one caller shouted. "And they have a two-week visa but stay for years. Why does our government let this happen?"
Uganda has said it remains committed to the African Union peacekeeping mission in Mogadishu, to which it contributes half the 6,000 African troops.
Uganda is also hosting a yearlong European Union training mission for Somali government troops to help in their effort to beat back Islamist militants in the capital. It is scheduled to host a summit of African Union leaders in Kampala this month, a meeting that will likely touch on ways to curb the threats coming from Somalia.
The attack illustrates how Africa's own peacekeepers have struggled to stabilize the country. The government controls only a section of the capital, with much of the country under the sway of al Shabaab, clans, other militants and pirates.
The al Shabaab insurgency rose to its height during the Ethiopian occupation of Somalia from 2006-08, when it won popular support and funding from wealthy Somalis for waging a guerrilla war against Ethiopian troops. The attack in Kampala, with a strike at an Ethiopian restaurant, marks an effort by al Shabaab to hit at that foe.
The militant group had vowed to attack "infidels" in Kenya for training Somali soldiers, and Uganda and Burundi for their contributions to the peacekeeping force, known as Amisom. Other nations supporting Amisom have been less open about their contributions, for fear of local opposition and reprisal.
Al Shabaab is "sending a message: Don't come here propping up the Somalia government," said Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa analyst in Nairobi for the International Crisis Group. "It's a message of deterrence."
While Uganda had been threatened by al Shabaab, it was less prepared for such an attack than other nations in East Africa. Muslims make up a minority of the population in Uganda, and it hasn't been considered a hotbed of Islamic radicalism or been as closely watched by international intelligence agencies in comparison to Muslim communities on the east coasts of Kenya and Tanzania.
Ugandan police issued a letter to area hotels two weeks ago urging them to improve security. Police spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba said it was a standard procedure and not related to any specific anticipated attack.
On Sunday, tourist-heavy crowds had gathered in front of televisions in Kampala to watch the World Cup finals. "Most people who died were just in front of me," says Ugandan musician Bebe Cool, who was performing at the rugby club. "The blast was so loud -- the next thing I saw were body parts flying over."

Winning Bees Spells Glory for Indian Kids on the Ethnic Circuit; South Asian Program Churns Out Champs; One on One With Shaquille O'Neal

LOS ANGELES--Eleven-year-old Sivateja Tangirala leaned into a microphone, spelled out the word D-I-A-T-R-I-B-E and earned his shot at fame.
Sivateja and his family had driven seven hours from Chandler, Ariz., to participate in the Los Angeles regional championship of the South Asian Spelling Bee last month. The cutthroat competition is a stepping stone to the national South Asian Spelling Bee, where children of immigrants from India and neighboring countries do battle by spelling out words such as osphresis and biloculine.
"I wanted to win this so badly," he told television cameras during a post-bee interview, clutching his winner's plaque, adorned with a bumblebee, to his chest.
American kids from all walks of life like a good spelling bee. But for thousands of Indian and South Asian children in the U.S., spelling, not soccer or basketball, has become the game of choice.
Competitions catering just to South Asians have sprung up across the country, some with big-name sponsors and hefty cash prizes. Spelling bees are carried live on Indian-theme satellite stations and are covered by Indian newspapers.
In Sivateja's family, top Indian spellers are household names. His whole family gathers around the television to watch the annual Scripps National Spelling Bee, the nation's most established competition, which attracts kids of all backgrounds. They also record it so they can watch it again.
"It's basically like watching the Lakers play," Sivateja says. "If one of our favorites gets out, we get a little depressed."
Among his idols are Sameer Mishra and Kavya Shivashankar, two recent Scripps winners. "I really like their techniques," he says.
Though Indian-Americans make up a mere 1% of the population, they have come to dominate the American spelling-bee circuit. Eight of the past 12 Scripps champions have been of Indian descent--including the last three in a row.
"The winners of spelling bees are like Nobel laureates," says Upendra Mishra, publisher of India New England, an ethnic bimonthly based in Waltham, Mass. "This is what it is equal to."
He says his paper is ramping up coverage of the South Asian Spelling Bee this year, covering various regional competitions leading up to the finals on Aug. 14, in North Brunswick, N.J.
The 2002 documentary "Spellbound," which followed eight teenagers as they prepared for and took part in the 1999 bee, helped put Indian dominance on the map. That year, the $40,000 grand prize went to Nupur Lala, an Indian-American girl who correctly spelled "logorrhea" in the final round.
In the coming season of the ABC reality TV show "Shaq vs.," in which Shaquille O'Neal challenges top athletes at their own sports, the winner of last year's Scripps National Spelling Bee, 14-year-old Kavya Shivashankar, will be shown competing in a spell-off against Mr. O'Neal in the fall.
For all their success, Indian-Americans have only recently become the masters of competitive spelling.
In 1989, Ratnam Chitturi, founder of the nonprofit North South Foundation, which stages regional and national academic contests for Indian-American children, noticed that in standardized tests Indian-Americans were consistently performing above average in every subject but English.
He set out to change that by creating a spelling bee pitched just to Indian-Americans. The first competition was held in 1993, and it has since spread to 75 locations throughout the country. Today, about 3,000 children, ranging from 1st to 8th grade, participate each year.
When Ms. Lala won the Scripps bee in 1999, tales of her bravado, fanned by the Internet, quickly spread through the Indian-American community.
Rahul Walia, an advertising executive who lives in New Jersey, was watching the Scripps National on TV that year. The success of the South Asian participants caught his eye, and he sensed a business opportunity. He launched the South Asian Spelling Bee in 2008, figuring that allowing South Asian kids to go head to head would make it extra competitive.
Because "South Asian kids are stereotyped as being nerdy and geeky and you know, always studying," he says, the bee would be a way "to vent out in an almost sport-like manner."
About 400 kids under 14 compete at the nine regional South Asian Spelling Bees. At the finals, the winner claims a $10,000 grand prize.
Companies such as insurer MetLife Inc. and Indian travel site help underwrite the competition.
While the kids prepare, MetLife gives their parents a presentation about financial planning for college. At the Los Angeles regional, parents took notes and raised their hands to ask questions.
John Derbick, assistant vice president at Global Brand & Marketing Services for Metlife, says the company decided to sponsor the bee after its research indicated how much Indian-Americans value education. And parents are enthusiasts of the approach.
"Our tendency is if we detect something that could lead them to excel, we keep pushing them and pushing them in that direction," says Radha Subrahmanyan, the mother of Mayank Ganesan, who competed but did not place in the San Francisco regional of the South Asian Spelling Bee.
Akshat Shekhar, who won the South Asian Spelling Bee last year, adhered to a rigorous training regimen, studying the roots, languages of origin, definitions and parts of speech of thousands of words from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekends, and after school until bedtime during the week.
A year later, he is still basking in the glow. He spent weeks doing interviews with different Indian-American newspapers and radio stations after he won.
"People will come up to me and be like, yeah, I read about you in the paper," says the 15-year-old, adding, "It happens a lot."

A 12th suspect in the Russian spy-ring case that erupted last month was deported by the U.S. on Tuesday, sent home on a free flight without being charged with a crime.
Alexev Karetnikov, 23 years old, who had lived in the Seattle area, was flown back to Russia from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, according to U.S. officials. His detention was first reported in The Wall Street Journal.
He was transported on Monday to New York for a connecting flight back to Russia after having been taken into custody on June 28 in Seattle, the official said. In the Seattle area, the young Russian had worked as an entry level software tester at Microsoft for less than year, a company spokesman said.
He wasn't charged as a secret agent, but he had been held since June 28 on immigration violations.
Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said Mr. Karetnikov admitted he was in the U.S. illegally and voluntarily agreed to leave. An immigration judge then ordered him deported, Mr. Chandler said.
U.S. officials had been tight-lipped about the detention of a 12th suspect in the case; it wasn't disclosed in court papers concerning 11 other agents who were previously identified.
Federal Bureau of Investigation counterintelligence agents have been investigating the man since last fall, when his name surfaced in the decade-long espionage case, according to an official familiar with the matter.
It isn't clear why he attracted scrutiny, but Mr. Karetnikov came to agents' attention shortly after he entered the U.S. in October 2009. He had obtained a visa two months earlier.
U.S. officials canceled the man's visa on June 26, a day before FBI agents rounded up 10 of the 11 members of the undercover ring who were in the U.S. The 11th suspect jumped bail in Cyprus after he was arrested there.
The official familiar with the case said investigators weren't able to gather enough evidence against Mr. Karetnikov to bring criminal charges, and concluded his case wasn't like that of the 11 others. It wasn't clear if he had the same training from Russia's SVR intelligence agency that the others are believed to have received.
Last Friday, the U.S. and Russia carried out a historic prisoner swap on the tarmac of the Vienna airport. In exchange for the 10 Russian undercover agents, Russia turned over four prisoners it held.
Since that swap, the 14 agents involved have remained out of public view in Russia, the U.S. and the U.K., where two of those released by Russia chose to go. All the agents are expected to undergo lengthy debriefing by intelligence officials before being allowed to move around freely.
U.S. authorities said the minor children of the 10 arrested by the U.S. have been sent to Russia to join their parents.
Also Tuesday, the U.K. took action against one of the admitted agents, Anna Chapman, revoking her British citizenship.
Ms. Chapman had married a British man while living in the U.K. for several years. As the spy saga unfolded, she received much publicity when photos of her, including some in which she was partially undressed, appeared in U.K. newspapers.
The U.K. Home Secretary also is likely to bar Ms. Chapman from returning to the U.K., something it is entitled to do if it determines such a move would be conducive to the public good.
Ms. Chapman grew up in Volgograd, Russia, as Anna Kushchenko. She met her husband, Alex Chapman, at a 2001 rave party while visiting London. The pair married the next year in Moscow, where she was studying at the time.

Full text: Author: Iain Martin
The triumph of free-market capitalism and liberal democracy--that didn't last very long, did it? After the Cold War they were declared to have won a combined victory that would secure their dominance down the centuries. The end of history--or the end of an ideological struggle about what is the best form of governing arrangement --was proclaimed in an essay published by the political philosopher Francis Fukuyama in 1989. It was then followed by a book bearing a similar title. The argument entered the mainstream: muscular American-led western capitalism underpinned by strong notions of freedom and democracy was the future.
And now, just two decades later? Free-marketeers appear to be in retreat and on the rise is the phenomenon known as "state capitalism." China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and a host of other smaller imitators are making the running while economic liberals suffer a collective crisis of confidence triggered by the financial crisis and its fallout.
Those countries practicing state capitalism are not democracies, or if they have some form of voting it is not democracy as known in the West. Their state-owned enterprises hoover up natural resources and with the vast profits governments construct state investment vehicles, or sovereign-wealth funds, that invest in global markets. They are, to varying degrees, hybrids--with just enough freedom allowed to enable a private sector to function, and flourish in China's case, but with strict limits that ensure the government gets what it wants.
And what these governments want most of all is to perpetuate and strengthen their own hold on power. This subject is at the heart of a fascinating book by Ian Bremmer, published earlier this summer. In "The End of the Free Market --Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations?" Mr. Bremmer tracks this trend and closes with some suggestions about what free-marketeers might do about it. He recommends not closing the door on free trade, foreign investment or immigration. And obviously keep focused on China, which he argues is so much more likely to have to move in a more free-market direction than the U.S. is to copy elements of its model.
However, the omens for free-marketeers are not hugely promising. The financial crisis has made it difficult to get a hearing. The idea that untrammeled competition and wild speculation in the private sector with roots in the U.S. caused the crisis that started in 2007 and has still not fully played out, is firmly fixed in the popular imagination. Western politicians, who had loved the endless cheap-money policies they authorized when times were good, were keen to take as little blame as possible when the boom they had helped inflate went bust. So, they blamed banks and reckless free-marketeering alone.
And in their policy responses, western governments resorted to such vast bail-outs of the financial sector and other industries that they almost nullified the case for proper free markets. The result, in significant swaths of banking in countriesnations such as the U.K., has been the re-emergence of a kind of corporatism, in which those in charge of these business must worry as much about pleasing the government as they must try to please their customers.
Why should state capitalists listen when they are told, by the governments who did the opposite in a crisis, to maintain open markets and improve competition?
As Mr. Bremmer puts it: "If Washington must spend hundreds of billions to bail out American- style capitalism and if a majority of Americans tell pollsters they favor a substantial government-led overhaul of the country's health-care system and its energy policy, how can U.S. officials argue with a straight face that foreign governments should intervene less in their domestic economies?"
It is a good question. Still, free-marketeers should not despair entirely. They still have the best arguments.
What drives genuine innovation, and growth of the kind seen in recent decades with computerization, is competition that begins in the marketplace of ideas. The enlightenment concept that "my idea is better than your idea, and now I'm going to prove it in a process of rational exploration and development", is what enabled entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates to start on their own in garages and small offices with nothing but smart ideas.
In a state-capitalist set-up could they really have done the same? The government in such states naturally favors the large enterprises it controls because it uses them to dispense patronage. In state capitalism, the dice are generally loaded against anarchic free-thinkers and innovators. In contrast, intertwined with western capitalism is political, religious and intellectual freedom. This is not a coincidence: the latter created the conditions for the former to flourish.
The difficulty, and Mr. Bremmer refers to it, is who will make such arguments for free markets when they have been discredited by a combination of cheap-money fixated politicians and a financial sector that was in love with its own excesses?
European governments don't seem particularly keen to do it, with their populations addicted to the welfarism, early retirement and expensive government intervention that crowds out growth-inducing enterprise. Much of business seems to suffer from a post-recessionary shyness too. A few think tanks are dusting these ideas down, but it will take more than that. These themes will need popular expression.
That will require a recalibration of capitalism--with lessons from the financial crisis learned--and the emergence of leaders in the U.S. and Europe prepared to make the positive case night and day, until they change the terms of debate, that free markets adequately regulated are the best place to look for widespread prosperity. Mr. Bremmer's book is a good starting point.

TOKYO--The past month has seen a flurry of female firsts in Japan. The Bank of Japan this week appointed its first female branch manager in its 128-year history. Japan Airlines Corp. announced its first female pilot captain. East Japan Railway now has female station masters in Tokyo for the first time.
Meanwhile, Renho, the mono-monickered member of parliament, garnered a record 1.7 million votes in Sunday's upper-house elections. The telegenic, 42-year-old former model, was the only candidate in the country to receive more than a million votes, even as her Democratic Party of Japan was getting crushed elsewhere. Her re-election cements her standing as one of the most popular politicians in Japan.
These recent developments would indicate a wave of girl power is sweeping the country. But the reality lags behind the headlines. The advancement and promotion of women in the world's second-largest economy is debatable, and by some measures, has worsened in recent years.
In a survey that measured progress in bridging the gender gap in areas such as politics, education, economy and health, the World Economic Forum last year ranked Japan at 101 out of 134 countries. More than two-thirds of the countries covered in the report have posted gains in their scores since 2006. Japan has slipped in the rankings every year, sliding back from its 80th spot in 2006.
"Women's participation in the labor force is not so low, but it's an M-shaped curve that dips when women hit their thirties and have children," said Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at JP Morgan in Tokyo. "When they come back to work, they are not likely to be promoted and there is also a lack of child-care facilities in Japan, which makes it difficult."
In listed Japanese companies, women made up just 1.2% of senior executives last year, according to a survey by business publisher Toyo Keizai. In comparison, in the U.S., women held 13.5% of executive-officer positions in Fortune 500 companies in 2009, according to a survey by Catalyst Inc, a nonprofit organization that focuses on women in the workplace.
The reasons for the dearth of high-profile women are myriad and complex. Japan suffers from tepid economic growth, draconian immigration policies and a shrinking population. The country lacks infrastructure and support for women with children, including accessible child care. A series of laws have aimed to facilitate the advancement of women in the workplace--including the Equal Employment Opportunity Law passed in 1986 and the Child Care Leave Law in 1992--but critics say enforcement is weak. Also, women in this predominantly patriarchal society are traditionally meant to be demure and so have few female role models.
"If I didn't have my parents around to look after my children, I don't think I could do this," says Mana Nakazora, the chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas in Tokyo. "I also think that women in their twenties are more conservative now than the previous generation, and they don't have role models. In China, women don't stay at home--it's regarded as perfectly normal to work."
Improvements in female participation in the work force have been slow in coming. The Bank of Japan trumpeted the appointment of Tokiko Shimizu, 45, as its first female branch manager. But the real news to some women was that it took more than a century. "Compared with other central banks, the BoJ is more conservative," said a former BoJ employee, now working in Tokyo's finance sector, who asked she not be identified. "I left because my career at the BoJ wouldn't have been so promising. If one comes back after having children, it's very difficult to get back on the career track. The BoJ missed many opportunities to promote people."
A BoJ spokesperson said: "The Bank of Japan in recent years has implemented lenient policies for maternity and parental leave."
The private-sector record isn't rosy, either. Ari Fuji, 42, became the first female captain at any Japanese airline when she was made a captain this week the JAL unit, JAL Express Co. In comparison, AMR Corp's American Airlines appointed its first female captain in 1986.
At Sony Corp., a leading multinational corporation with a foreigner as its chief executive, just 3.5% of its managers were women last year in Japan, according to the company. That compares with a ratio of 32.2% female managers at its operations in the U.S.
Still, the latest promotions suggest the drive to better utilize the female labor force is gaining some momentum, though the pace of change remains slow to glacial. Shiseido Co., Japan's leading cosmetics company, says it aims to achieve a 30% ratio of female leaders by the 2013 fiscal year, from a current ratio of 19%. It is one of the few Japanese companies to have a woman on its board of directors, and has an in-house child-care facility in its offices in Tokyo called Kangaroom.

Abstract: After Studds' death, his spouse was denied both health insurance and the normal survivor annuity -- the only widower of a member of Congress to be refused these benefits. (If he is still there when it is heard -- appeals take years, and he turns 74 later this month.) In a 1996 decision striking down a Colorado law that repealed all antidiscrimination protection for gay people, he noted that it "has the peculiar property of imposing a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group."

Full text: Last week, a federal court in Massachusetts held unconstitutional the provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA, that denies federal benefits to same-sex spouses. The ruling relied on two arguments: that the law interfered with the rights of states guaranteed in the 10th Amendment, and that it violated the Constitution's equal protection clause. The first of these arguments doesn't make much sense, but the second is so strong that it has a good chance of being accepted by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Section 3 of DOMA requires that marriage, for all federal purposes, be defined as the union of one man and one woman. It was challenged by the attorney general in Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage is legal, and also in a separate suit by seven married same-sex couples and three widowers in the state who had been in same-sex marriages. The plaintiffs include the surviving spouse of Rep. Gerry Studds (D-Mass.), the first openly gay man to serve in Congress. After Studds' death, his spouse was denied both health insurance and the normal survivor annuity -- the only widower of a member of Congress to be refused these benefits.
In the case brought by Massachusetts, the court held that DOMA intrudes on "traditional government functions," specifically the state's right to define what marriage is. In the individuals' cases, it held that there is no rational basis for denying federal benefits to same-sex spouses in marriages legally recognized in their states. The first of these arguments is silly, and potentially mischievous. But the second is very strong, and can and should carry the day if, as is likely, the case is appealed all the way to the Supreme Court.
The trouble with the states' rights argument is its implication that whenever a federal law uses the word "marriage" to define the scope of some federal program, it is obligated to follow state law. But an obvious counterexample exists: immigration. In most states, the government doesn't involve itself in the reasons a couple marries, even if there's no love involved and the marriage is primarily a business transaction or a matter of convenience. But when people marry for immigration purposes, the federal government has no trouble deeming the marriage "fraudulent," even though it remains valid under state law. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency doesn't interfere with traditional state functions because it leaves the state free to recognize, for its own purposes, any marriage it likes. But it won't grant legal residency to immigrants it believes married only to secure the benefit.
The other part of the court's ruling, however, held that DOMA lacked a rational basis because none of the government's justifications for the law's blanket discrimination made sense. It's hard to see, for example, how the law would protect traditional marriage. Are same-sex couples going to be discouraged from marrying because they wouldn't be entitled to be buried together in a veterans cemetery? Not likely. This irrationality, and the unprecedented burden it imposes -- no class of state-recognized marriages has ever before in American history been subjected to this kind of federal discrimination -- led the court to infer an unconstitutional purpose: a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group.
The case will probably be appealed. But will it be upheld? This Supreme Court is unlikely to conclude that same-sex marriage must be allowed in all states. But you can invalidate DOMA without going that far, by focusing on its unprecedented, blunderbuss character.
On the current Supreme Court, this case would probably depend on the swing vote of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. (If he is still there when it is heard -- appeals take years, and he turns 74 later this month.) In a 1996 decision striking down a Colorado law that repealed all antidiscrimination protection for gay people, he noted that it "has the peculiar property of imposing a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group." This kind of imposition "is unprecedented in our jurisprudence," and he declared that it "is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort." Similarly, in a 2003 decision invalidating a law banning homosexual sex, he observed that such gay-specific laws were very recent, originating in the 1970s. That same logic might well condemn DOMA, but it would be unlikely to invalidate the marriage laws of individual states.
Even the states' rights argument could be rehabilitated if, on appeal, Massachusetts focuses on the equality argument. The district court ruled in favor of the state for two independent reasons, only one of which relied on inherent state functions. The other, better argument was that a state can't be required to violate the Constitution in order to get federal funds. If DOMA is unconstitutional because of the way it singles out gay people to beat up on, then states can't be denied federal funds when they refuse to administer it. For example, if DOMA's requirement that same-sex couples be excluded from veterans cemeteries is unconstitutional, then Massachusetts can't lose its federal funding when it buries a same-sex couple in a state-administered veterans cemetery.
There's a lesson here for lawyers. There is a temptation in litigation to make every argument you can possibly think of, hoping that something will persuade the judge.
Here, though, that strategy has backfired: The judge bought both arguments, the bad one as well as the good one, and so his opinion ended up looking weaker than it really is.

Full text: A 12th Russian whose name surfaced last fall as part of a federal investigation into a Moscow spy network in the United States was deported back to his home country Tuesday after investigators determined that he had not committed any crimes during his nine-month stay here.
Alexey Karetnikov, a 23-year-old Russian citizen who was living in Seattle, was taken into U.S. custody June 28. The FBI's investigation led to a series of arrests last month in New York, New Jersey and Virginia. On Monday, a federal immigration judge ordered Karetnikov deported.
U.S. officials said Karetnikov "would face criminal and civil penalties if he returned without express U.S. government permission."
Justice Department officials said Karetnikov was not "charged with any criminal violation" in connection with the other agents, and that the intent all along was to deport Karetnikov once the others were prosecuted and deported.
"We investigated thoroughly, and if we had been able to prosecute the individual, we would have," said a federal law enforcement official.
Matt Chandler, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, said that as part of the decision to deport Karetnikov without the filing of criminal charges, "Mr. Karetnikov admitted that he was present in the United States in violation of immigration law and voluntarily agreed to deportation in lieu of further court proceedings."
Karetnikov came to the U.S. in October, in contrast to some of the others who arrived here years ago and set up new families and lifestyles.
Last week, 10 Russian operatives abruptly pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to a charge of failing to register as foreign agents. They were deported to Moscow, in return for the Russian Federation's release of four longtime prisoners who admitted they had spied against Russia. Two of the four were taken to England, the other two to the United States.
An 11th operative, identified as Christopher R. Metsos, the alleged "paymaster" of the operation, was briefly held and released by police in Cyprus. He has since disappeared.
Earlier this week, in his first extensive public comments on the matter, Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said federal authorities broke up the spy ring and arrested the first 10 individuals because the husband of one of the members was in the process of traveling to France, and then on to Russia.
"The concern was that, if we let him go, we would not be able to get him back," Holder said.

Abstract: The cutthroat competition is a stepping stone to the national South Asian Spelling Bee, where children of immigrants from India and neighboring countries do battle by spelling out words such as osphresis and biloculine. Because "South Asian kids are stereotyped as being nerdy and geeky and you know, always studying," he says, the bee would be a way "to vent out in an almost sport-like manner."

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Eleven-year-old Sivateja Tangirala leaned into a microphone, spelled out the word D-I-A-T-R-I-B-E and earned his shot at fame.
Sivateja and his family had driven seven hours from Chandler, Ariz., to participate in the Los Angeles regional championship of the South Asian Spelling Bee last month. The cutthroat competition is a stepping stone to the national South Asian Spelling Bee, where children of immigrants from India and neighboring countries do battle by spelling out words such as osphresis and biloculine.
"I wanted to win this so badly," he told television cameras during a post-bee interview, clutching his winner's plaque, adorned with a bumblebee, to his chest.
American kids from all walks of life like a good spelling bee. But for thousands of Indian and South Asian children in the U.S., spelling, not soccer or basketball, has become the game of choice.
Competitions catering just to South Asians have sprung up across the country, some with big-name sponsors and hefty cash prizes. Spelling bees are carried live on Indian-theme satellite stations and are covered by Indian newspapers.
In Sivateja's family, top Indian spellers are household names. His whole family gathers around the television to watch the annual Scripps National Spelling Bee, the nation's most established competition, which attracts kids of all backgrounds. They also record it so they can watch it again.
"It's basically like watching the Lakers play," Sivateja says. "If one of our favorites gets out, we get a little depressed."
Among his idols are Sameer Mishra and Kavya Shivashankar, two recent Scripps winners. "I really like their techniques," he says.
Though Indian-Americans make up a mere 1% of the population, they have come to dominate the American spelling-bee circuit. Eight of the past 12 Scripps champions have been of Indian descent -- including the last three in a row.
"The winners of spelling bees are like Nobel laureates," says Upendra Mishra, publisher of India New England, an ethnic bimonthly based in Waltham, Mass. "This is what it is equal to."
He says his paper is ramping up coverage of the South Asian Spelling Bee this year, covering various regional competitions leading up to the finals on Aug. 14, in North Brunswick, N.J.
The 2002 documentary "Spellbound," which followed eight teenagers as they prepared for and took part in the 1999 bee, helped put Indian dominance on the map. That year, the $40,000 grand prize went to Nupur Lala, an Indian-American girl who correctly spelled "logorrhea" in the final round.
In the coming season of the ABC reality TV show "Shaq vs.," in which Shaquille O'Neal challenges top athletes at their own sports, the winner of last year's Scripps National Spelling Bee, 14-year-old Kavya Shivashankar, will be shown competing in a spell-off against Mr. O'Neal in the fall.
For all their success, Indian-Americans have only recently become the masters of competitive spelling.
In 1989, Ratnam Chitturi, founder of the nonprofit North South Foundation, which stages regional and national academic contests for Indian-American children, noticed that in standardized tests Indian-Americans were consistently performing above average in every subject but English.
He set out to change that by creating a spelling bee pitched just to Indian-Americans. The first competition was held in 1993, and it has since spread to 75 locations throughout the country. Today, about 3,000 children, ranging from 1st to 8th grade, participate each year.
When Ms. Lala won the Scripps bee in 1999, tales of her bravado, fanned by the Internet, quickly spread through the Indian-American community.
Rahul Walia, an advertising executive who lives in New Jersey, was watching the Scripps National on TV that year. The success of the South Asian participants caught his eye, and he sensed a business opportunity. He launched the South Asian Spelling Bee in 2008, figuring that allowing South Asian kids to go head to head would make it extra competitive.
Because "South Asian kids are stereotyped as being nerdy and geeky and you know, always studying," he says, the bee would be a way "to vent out in an almost sport-like manner."
About 400 kids under 14 compete at the nine regional South Asian Spelling Bees. At the finals, the winner claims a $10,000 grand prize.
Companies such as insurer MetLife Inc. and Indian travel site Yatra.com help underwrite the competition.
While the kids prepare, MetLife gives their parents a presentation about financial planning for college. At the Los Angeles regional, parents took notes and raised their hands to ask questions.
John Derbick, assistant vice president at Global Brand & Marketing Services for Metlife, says the company decided to sponsor the bee after its research indicated how much Indian-Americans value education. And parents are enthusiasts of the approach.
"Our tendency is if we detect something that could lead them to excel, we keep pushing them and pushing them in that direction," says Radha Subrahmanyan, the mother of Mayank Ganesan, who competed but did not place in the San Francisco regional of the South Asian Spelling Bee.
Akshat Shekhar, who won the South Asian Spelling Bee last year, adhered to a rigorous training regimen, studying the roots, languages of origin, definitions and parts of speech of thousands of words from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekends, and after school until bedtime during the week.
A year later, he is still basking in the glow. He spent weeks doing interviews with different Indian-American newspapers and radio stations after he won.
"People will come up to me and be like, yeah, I read about you in the paper," says the 15-year-old, adding, "It happens a lot."

Full text: TOKYO -- The past month has seen a flurry of female firsts in Japan. The Bank of Japan this week appointed its first female branch manager in its 128-year history. Japan Airlines Corp. announced its first female pilot captain. East Japan Railway now has female station masters in Tokyo for the first time.
Meanwhile, Renho, the mono- monikered member of Parliament, garnered a record 1.7 million votes in Sunday's upper-house elections. The telegenic 42-year-old former model was the only candidate in the country to receive more than a million votes, even as her Democratic Party of Japan was getting crushed elsewhere. Her re-election cements her standing as one of the most popular politicians in Japan.
These developments would indicate a wave of girl power is sweeping the country. But the reality lags behind the headlines. The advancement and promotion of women in the world's second-largest economy is debatable, and by some measures, has worsened in recent years.
In a survey that measured progress in bridging the gender gap in areas such as politics, education, economy and health, the World Economic Forum last year ranked Japan at 101 out of 134 countries. More than two-thirds of the countries covered in the report have posted gains in their scores since 2006. Japan has slipped in the rankings every year, sliding back from the 80th spot in 2006.
"Women's participation in the labor force is not so low, but it's an M-shaped curve that dips when women hit their thirties and have children," said Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo. "When they come back to work, they are not likely to be promoted and there is also a lack of child-care facilities in Japan, which makes it difficult."
In listed Japanese companies, women made up just 1.2% of senior executives last year, according to a survey by business publisher Toyo Keizai. In comparison, in the U.S., women held 13.5% of executive-officer positions in Fortune 500 companies in 2009, according to a survey by Catalyst Inc., a nonprofit organization that focuses on women in the workplace.
The reasons for the dearth of high-profile women are myriad and complex. Japan suffers from tepid economic growth, draconian immigration policies and a shrinking population. The country lacks infrastructure and support for women with children, including accessible child care. A series of laws have aimed to facilitate the advancement of women in the workplace -- including the Equal Employment Opportunity Law passed in 1986 and the Child Care Leave Law in 1992 -- but critics say enforcement is weak.
"If I didn't have my parents around to look after my children, I don't think I could do this," says Mana Nakazora, the chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas in Tokyo. "I also think that women in their twenties are more conservative now than the previous generation, and they don't have role models. In China, women don't stay at home -- it's regarded as perfectly normal to work."
Improvements in female participation in the work force have been slow. The Bank of Japan trumpeted the appointment of Tokiko Shimizu, 45, as its first female branch manager. But the real news to some women was that it took more than a century.
"Compared with other central banks, the BOJ is more conservative," said a former BOJ employee, now working in Tokyo's finance sector. "I left because my career at the BOJ wouldn't have been so promising. If one comes back after having children, it's very difficult to get back on the career track. The BOJ missed many opportunities to promote people."
A BOJ official said "the Bank of Japan in recent years has implemented lenient policies for maternity and parental leave."
The private-sector record isn't rosy, either. Ari Fuji, 42, became the first female captain at any Japanese airline when she was made a captain this week for the JAL unit, JAL Express Co. In comparison, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines appointed its first female captain in 1986.
At Sony Corp., a leading multinational corporation with a foreigner as its chief executive, just 3.5% of its managers were women last year in Japan, according to the company. That compares with a ratio of 32.2% female managers at its operations in the U.S.
Still, the latest promotions suggest the drive to better utilize the female labor force is gaining momentum, though the pace of change remains slow to glacial. Shiseido Co., Japan's leading cosmetics company, says it aims to achieve a 30% ratio of female leaders by the 2013 fiscal year, from a current ratio of 19%. It is one of the few Japanese companies to have a woman on its board of directors, and has an in-house child-care facility in its offices in Tokyo.

Full text: A 12th suspect in the Russian spy-ring case that erupted last month was deported by the U.S. on Tuesday, sent home on a free flight without being charged with a crime.
Alexev Karetnikov, 23 years old, who had lived in the Seattle area, was flown back to Russia from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, according to U.S. officials. His detention was first reported in The Wall Street Journal.
He was transported on Monday to New York for a connecting flight back to Russia after having been taken into custody on June 28 in Seattle, the official said. In the Seattle area, the young Russian had worked as an entry level software tester at Microsoft Corp. for less than year, a company spokesman said.
He wasn't charged as a secret agent, but he had been held since June 28 on immigration violations.
Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said Mr. Karetnikov admitted he was in the U.S. illegally and voluntarily agreed to leave. An immigration judge then ordered him deported, Mr. Chandler said.
U.S. officials had been tight-lipped about the detention of a 12th suspect in the case; it wasn't disclosed in court papers concerning 11 other agents who were previously identified.
Federal Bureau of Investigation counterintelligence agents have been investigating the man since last fall, when his name surfaced in the decade-long espionage case, according to an official familiar with the matter.
It isn't clear why he attracted scrutiny, but Mr. Karetnikov came to agents' attention shortly after he entered the U.S. in October 2009. He had obtained a visa two months earlier.
U.S. officials canceled the man's visa on June 26, a day before FBI agents rounded up 10 of the 11 members of the undercover ring who were in the U.S. The 11th suspect jumped bail in Cyprus after he was arrested there.
The official familiar with the case said investigators weren't able to gather enough evidence against Mr. Karetnikov to bring criminal charges, and concluded his case wasn't like that of the 11 others. It wasn't clear if he had the same training from Russia's SVR intelligence agency that the others are believed to have received.
Last Friday, the U.S. and Russia carried out a historic prisoner swap at the Vienna airport. In exchange for the 10 Russian undercover agents, Russia turned over four prisoners it held.
Since that swap, the 14 agents involved have remained out of public view in Russia, the U.S. and the U.K., where two of those released by Russia chose to go. All the agents are expected to undergo lengthy debriefing by intelligence officials.
U.S. authorities said the minor children of the 10 arrested by the U.S. have been sent to Russia to join their parents.
Also Tuesday, the U.K. took action against one of the admitted agents, Anna Chapman, revoking her British citizenship.
Ms. Chapman had married a British man while living in the U.K. for several years. As the spy saga unfolded, she received much publicity when photos of her, including some in which she was partially undressed, appeared in U.K. newspapers.

Full text: White: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa.
-- Racial definition from the U.S. Census Bureau
With all the talk lately about "white vote," I thought it would be helpful to know what a white person is. As the census definition makes clear, who knows? It's a biological fiction, a figment of the pigment beneath which all human beings are the same.
And yet, with midterm elections just a few months away, the so-called white vote looms large, an angry and vindictive political force. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released Tuesday showed that President Obama's approval ratings have reached "a new low among whites, at 40 percent, with his positive marks dipping under 50 percent for the first time among white college-educated women."
Does race have anything to do with it? You betcha.
"What explains the white surge to the GOP?" commentator Patrick Buchanan asks in a recent issue of the American Conservative magazine. Among the answers, he says, is "a growing perception that Obama is biased." Or, as Glenn Beck said last year on his Fox TV show: Obama has a "deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture."
To hear whites tell it, what really bothers them is a growing federal government that they fear will intervene in their lives -- unless there's an oil spill along the Gulf Coast, of course, in which case their complaint is too little intervention. Budget deficits are a worry, too, unless it's George Bush running up the red ink.
But, as Buchanan and Beck have noted, there is no escaping the role of race in the animosity toward Obama.
Whites, for instance, are overwhelmingly in favor of Arizona's immigration law, according to most polls. And virtually none of the surveys has shown any concern for the rights of nonwhite Hispanics who would be subject to racial profiling and illegal search and seizures. These are the same people who like to wave copies of the U.S. Constitution and claim Obama is curtailing their freedoms.
"The differences between whites and nonwhites on [the Arizona immigration law] are very stark," Matthew Kerbel, a political scientist at Villanova University, told the Christian Science Monitor. "The numbers seem to reflect that among white American voters, there is something that needs to be done about illegal immigration and that the Arizona law addresses that. But among blacks and Hispanics, the law is viewed as a strong form of racial profiling, and so there is strong sentiment against it."
Amazing, really, how people from German, Irish, English, Italian, Polish, French, Welsh, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian and Russian backgrounds can land on American shores and coalesce around a racial category concocted solely to exploit others.
Enter the pitiful "tea party" movement -- made up largely of well-educated and well-heeled whites. How desperately they cling to privileges that accrue from their skin color, going so far as to proclaim themselves victims of reverse discrimination.
According to a New York Times/CBS poll in April, tea party supporters are having a conniption fit because Obama is supposedly helping the poor people rather than the middle class or the rich.
"The overwhelming majority of supporters say Mr. Obama does not share the values most Americans live by and that he does not understand the problems of people like themselves," the Times report on the poll said. "More than half say the policies of the administration favor the poor, and 25 percent think that the administration favors blacks over whites."
Tell that to black people who live in places such as Southeast Washington, where the unemployment rate exceeds 30 percent.
As for those who would claim that blacks relish their racial designation as much as whites do theirs, just remember that if white people didn't insist on being white, there would be no such thing as race.
Eventually, though, demographic changes will render such designations all but meaningless. Despite resistance from those who have a death grip on white privilege, we are becoming a nation of people having origins not in geography but in humanity. Some day soon, let's hope, each of us will be a minority of one, and when we go to the polls we'll vote as Americans.

Full text: Federal authorities detained a 12th person in their investigation of a Russian spy ring in the United States, and he has been deported to Russia, U.S. law enforcement officials said Tuesday.
The man, Alexey Karetnikov, entered the United States in October and was living in the Seattle area, where he worked at Microsoft, according to federal officials and the company. Karetnikov, a Russian citizen in his early-to-mid-20s, had been held on immigration violations because there was insufficient evidence to charge him with a crime, the government officials said.
"He was just in the early stages; had just set up shop," said one senior federal law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details of the case were closely held. The official added that the FBI was monitoring the Russian almost immediately upon his arrival and that he had "obtained absolutely no information."
An immigration judge issued an order Monday for Karetnikov's removal from the United States, said Matt Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. The Russian admitted he was illegally present in the country and agreed to the deportation in lieu of further court proceedings, said Chandler, who added that Karetnikov "would face criminal and civil penalties if he returned without express U.S. government permission.''
U.S. officials said Karetnikov was sent home Tuesday.
Database searches show that someone with Karetnikov's name had been living in an apartment in Redmond, Wash., since October. That man's Facebook page says he worked for Microsoft and a Romanian-based software company called Neobit.
Lou Gellos, a Microsoft spokesman, confirmed that Karetnikov had worked at the company for about nine months as a software tester. He said Karetnikov is the man whom authorities deported on Tuesday but would not comment further.
The latest detention added a new wrinkle to a case that has fascinated Americans since 10 people were arrested June 27 and charged with working as deep undercover Russian spies. The 10 sleeper agents pleaded guilty Thursday to acting as unregistered agents for Russia and were then "swapped" for four Russian prisoners in a deal reminiscent of the Cold War. An 11th man charged in federal court in New York remains at large.
Details about the 12th alleged spy came as information emerged on how the 10 agents involved in the swap are faring in Russia. Russian news media reported that they have applied to a witness-protection program and are seeking to change their names.
Moskovsky Komsomolets, a Russian newspaper, reported that the 10 agents are being debriefed at a Russian intelligence facility on the outskirts of Moscow. They are not allowed to leave the premises, but family members are allowed to visit, the newspaper said.
The reticence that most are showing might not apply to Anna Chapman, who became a tabloid sensation in the United States when sultry photographs of her were posted on the Internet after her arrest. Russian news media reported that Chapman is willing to sell her story to journalists.
Chapman had told her U.S. attorney, Robert M. Baum, that she may want to relocate to Britain, where the Russian acquired dual citizenship in 2002 through her marriage to a British businessman, Baum said Tuesday. But he said the British government has stripped Chapman of her citizenship and revoked her passport, citing the spy case.
In the United States, officials indicated last week that the case had effectively shut down the spy ring. But law enforcement officials said Tuesday that Karetnikov was not part of the same ring and had no direct ties to the other spies, although his name came up in the broader investigation.
It was unclear when Karetnikov was detained, although an official said he was in custody by last week. He was apparently not part of the swap because unlike the other 10 agents, he was not charged with a crime. One official said Karetnikov was "just doing the things he needed to do to establish cover," including holding down a job.
Asked whether further arrests are possible, one official said U.S. law enforcement authorities are closely monitoring all potential espionage activity but added, "I don't think there will be a 13th or a 14th arrest here."

Full text: The 'Party of No'
Has the Chicago Tribune been so busy bashing Democrats in its headlines, editorials, cartoons and op-ed pages that it has overlooked the deplorable state of the Republican Party?
Republicans have absolutely no positive agenda. The sole objective of the "Party of No" is to bring down the Obama administration. The de facto leaders of the GOP are extremists Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin. (Joe the Plumber seems to have fallen from favor.)
The party continuously panders to the religious right, the gun lobby and angry white men in general. The cynical selection of John McCain's running mate is an egregious example.
Anti-government (Barack Obama) fervor, encouraged by the Republican Party, has reached a dangerous level. Tea partiers brandish vicious signs calling Obama a Communist and comparing him to Hitler. They complain about taxes even though tax rates are the lowest since 1950.
Only in the Republican Party is "moderate" a dirty word. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, once deemed to be presidential timber, has been forced to leave the party because he once embraced the president of the United States. McCain has had to "rethink" his principles to counter a primary challenge from the right. And poor old very conservative Sen. Bob Bennett wasn't conservative enough for the right-wingers of Utah.
The GOP has become the anti-science party. It has opposed stem-cell research. And, although perhaps 95 percent of the scientific community acknowledges the undeniable fact of climate change, Republicans tend to believe the 5 percent who don't. And they'd prefer to ignore the barrier between church and state by favoring the teaching of creationism -- not science but religion -- in the public schools.
The moment Elena Kagan was announced as Obama's choice for the Supreme Court, several Republican senators declared their opposition. What were laudable qualities in Republican Chief Justice John Roberts, et al., seemed to be negatives in a Democratic nominee. The old "legislate-from-the-bench" mantra surfaced immediately. Never mind that conservatives Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Roberts and Samuel Alito have been the greatest bench-legislators in history.
So isn't it time for the Chicago Tribune to take a break from its juvenile "countdown to the election" (throw the Democrats out!) calendar to examine the Republican alternative?
-- Dick Doub, Wilmette
Training classes
I commend Mayor Richard Daley for his swift proposals to regulate gun purchases since the overturn of Chicago's gun ban. I especially like the requirement of all gun owners to take a course on safe gun use.
Perhaps there's a way to require all of Chicago's first-time parents-to-be to take a course on infant and child rearing? After all, education is the key.
-- Wendy Kendrick, Evanston
Daley's joke
Mayor Richard Daley's plan for gun ownership in Chicago is ridiculous. He wants to make legal gun owners jump through 20 hoops if they want to buy a gun. I'm not even a gun owner or plan to buy a gun and I think it's idiotic.
How did that gun ban work the last 28 years, Mayor? What a joke!
-- Mick Koeppen, Cary
Wal-Mart's strategy
Remember when Wal-Mart's slogan was "Made in the USA"? Not anymore. It forced companies to manufacture overseas to get those lower prices people praise Wal-Mart for. Manufacturing overseas means jobs go overseas and fewer U.S. jobs.
Forcing lower prices from producers ("Weight of Wal-Mart crushes pop price," Page 1, July 4) also means fewer raises, fewer jobs for the producers.
Wal-Mart's strategy? Lower prices, get rid of competition, raise prices.
How is that helping families?
-- Patty Larson, Arlington Heights
Illegal students
I don't quite get the point of Tribune reporter Ofelia Casillas' story about illegal immigrants who cannot apply for federal financial aid for college ("Illegal immigrant status dashes scholarship hopes," Page 1, Chicagoland Extra, July 2).
Are we to feel sorry for illegals who don't qualify for federal aid? Should the government add to our expanding $13 trillion deficit to help these students?
Life isn't easy and there are no guarantees.
Maybe some of these young people should consider returning and applying to their home country for aid. Maybe their parents, here illegally, can contribute more to their schooling.
-- Rick Slupik, Arlington Heights
Public employees
To all the people who have recently been complaining about how public employees make too much money, here is a better question: Why are professional athletes paid millions of dollars for doing nothing productive?
-- Georg Zinser, Mount Prospect
Teacher's reminder
When I taught kindergarten, I had a sign on my wall that read, "I love little children, and it is no small thing that they, who are fresh from God, love us. Charles Dickens."
It reminded me why I was really in the profession.
-- Jane Sampe, Palatine

Full text: A 12th Russian whose name surfaced last fall as part of a federal investigation into a Moscow spy network in the United States was deported to his home country Tuesday after federal investigators determined that he had not committed any crimes during his nine-month stay here.
Alexey Karetnikov, a 23-year-old Russian citizen who was living in Seattle, was taken into U.S. custody June 28 during the course of the FBI's investigation, which led to a series of arrests last month in New York, New Jersey and Virginia. On Monday, a federal immigration judge ordered Karetnikov deported.
U.S. officials said that "once deported, Mr. Karetnikov would face criminal and civil penalties if he returned without express U.S. government permission."
At the Justice Department, which prosecuted the spy ring, authorities said Karetnikov "has not been charged with any criminal violation" in connection with the other spies, and the intent all along was to deport Karetnikov once the others were prosecuted.
"We investigated thoroughly, and if we had been able to prosecute the individual (Karetnikov) we would have," a federal law enforcement official said.
Karetnikov came to the United States last October, in contrast to some of the others who arrived years ago and set up new families and lifestyles.
Last week, 10 Russian operatives abruptly pleaded guilty in federal court in New York and then were deported to Moscow, in return for the Russian Federation releasing four longtime prisoners who admitted that they had spied against Russia.
An 11th operative, identified as Christopher Metsos, was briefly held and then freed by police in Cyprus.

British officials revoke Chapman's citizenship
LONDON -- Britain has stripped Russian Anna Chapman of her British citizenship following her deportation from the United States in a spy swap last week, the Home Office said Tuesday.
Chapman, also known as Anya Kushchenko, lived in Britain for several years after marrying an Englishman in 2002. Her lawyer has indicated Chapman, 28, who is now divorced, may seek to return to Britain, according to news reports.

Full text: While I agree with many of the recommendations of Eli Lilly's CEO John C. Lechleiter ("," op-ed, July 9) for upgrading our science education, the major factors in the flight of American students from the sciences, engineering and math have been economic and academic difficulty compared to other disciplines. Other professions have proved more lucrative with lesser academic rigor required, including law and business. As a retired research chemist, I have seen a gradual downgrading of the image of science in the public eye, with both pay and the constant threat of layoffs. Research personnel are among the first to go when companies need to spend less.
When I mention to young or old friends that I majored in organic chemistry with a minor in physical chemistry, the almost universal response is that the field required too difficult academic work without the promise of financial reward.
Other professions are replete with the names of individuals who majored in the sciences and decided that other disciplines were more attractive--to name a few, Margaret Thatcher, Angela Merkel and even former Mayor Marion Barry.
Is this a generation of Americans for whom the work ethic is less and academic challenges are to be avoided? I would hope not, but the evidence seems to show that this is the case as we fall further behind in technical fields required for economic growth.
Nelson Marans
Silver Spring, Md.
Does medical innovation require a for-profit incentive, as Mr. Lechleiter asserts? Jonas Salk, inventor of the first successful polio vaccine, did not patent his enormously valuable product because he wished to minimize financial obstacles to universal immunization. Salk's research was funded by two organizations: the National Science Foundation, a federal agency created in 1950, and the March of Dimes, a not-for profit charity founded in 1938 (as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis).
The therapeutic effectiveness of breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) was proved in research conducted by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, a not-for-profit clinical trials cooperative founded five decades ago by the National Cancer Institute, another federal agency.
Medical research can be driven by the expectation of a patent and big profit. However, the polio vaccine and breast-conserving surgery are real world examples of innovation which do not fit into Mr. Lechleiter's formulation. The theory he proposes, for which he supplies no successful examples, should not be the basis for public policy.
Dwight K. Oxley, M.D.
Wichita, Kan.
Mr. Lechleiter has a program to restore America's leadership in innovation. I am afraid that he is way too late. I see scientific journals with not a single contribution from the U.S. All are from China, Taiwan, India and Japan and, by the way, written in impeccable English. The American education system is a train wreck.
As a British scientist immigrant who prospered in this wonderful country in the 20th century, I am sad to say that the 21st century will not be the "second American century" as far as innovation is concerned.

Even as the Obama administration cracks down on companies that hire illegal immigrants, it is simultaneously going after employers that it says go too far in vetting job applicants to ensure they are entitled to work in the U.S.
The Department of Homeland Security currently is auditing employment records of many companies suspected of hiring undocumented workers. Yet in an emerging paradox for businesses, the Justice Department and other agencies have stepped up probes of employers--including restaurant groups, factories and retailers--for allegedly violating anti-discrimination laws by demanding too many identity documents from applicants who aren't U.S. citizens.
To fend off lawsuits or enforcement actions, several companies have recently reached out-of-court settlements with the government; in some instances they paid fines.
"The message is: Employers beware. You need to worry just as much about asking for too many immigration documents as you do about not asking for enough," said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration-law scholar at Cornell University.
The current tension arose from provisions in the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The IRCA prohibits employers from knowingly or intentionally hiring illegal immigrants; companies must verify a person's work eligibility through the "I-9" form process, in which new hires present identity documents and employers examine them for authenticity.
Anti-discrimination protections in the INA, meanwhile, guarantee "all individuals authorized to work in the U.S. have the right to seek employment without the added burden of special rules or document demands based on their citizenship status or national origin," said Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for civil rights. He said his unit is prioritizing enforcement of the INA provisions.
"The monkey is on the back of employers to make the call," said Mary Pivec, a Washington, D.C., attorney who is defending several companies with immigration-related problems. "We have more enforcement paired with insufficient and inconsistent guidance. Companies are in the crossfire."
By the end of 2010, the Justice Department will have boosted by 25% the total number of attorneys and investigators in its Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-related Unfair Employment Practices. The department doesn't disclose how many companies it is investigating, but a spokesperson didn't deny claims by immigration attorneys that there has been a surge in cases.
"The Obama administration has been much more active in enforcing the immigration law's anti-discrimination provisions than the Bush administration," Mr. Yale-Loehr said.
Companies face a maximum $1,100 civil monetary penalty for each individual from whom they demanded too many documents to prove work eligibility.
"It's a Catch-22," said Randy Johnson, senior vice president for labor and immigration at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the big business trade group. "Innocent employers get caught up in this snare of enforcement."
Businesses also face a proliferation of state laws designed to punish employers that hire undocumented immigrants. The U.S. Supreme Court is to consider this fall whether Arizona had the right to enact a 2007 law that empowers the state to revoke the business license of any employer found to knowingly hire illegal workers. The court is to determine whether federal immigration law preempts the state's statute.
On July 8, the Justice Department sued Garland Sales Inc., a rug manufacturer in Dalton, Ga., alleging it "engaged in a pattern of bias by imposing unnecessary and discriminatory hurdles" to employment for foreigners who were authorized to work in the U.S, according to a statement by the agency.
The government alleges that Garland required all non-U.S. citizens applying for jobs to present additional documents, in violation of the law. The Justice Department also said Garland "retaliated" against a naturalized U.S. citizen who has limited English skills by rescinding his job offer after he failed to produce a green card, which proves lawful U.S. residency for non-citizens. The person had presented a Social Security card and driver's license.
The company, which employs 300 people, denied the accusations and said it will defend itself.
"Garland Sales does not discriminate against individuals because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin in its hiring process and categorically denies the allegations," the rug maker said in a news release.
In late June, the Justice Department announced it had reached an agreement with Morton's Restaurant Group Inc. to settle allegations that an outlet in Portland, Ore., had required two noncitizens authorized to work in the U.S. to present more documents than legally required to establish their work eligibility. Both were fired after working for a time while the company reviewed their documentation.
"Morton's fired the workers after it rejected their valid Social Security cards and demanded to see additional documentation establishing their work authorization. In contrast, Morton's routinely permitted U.S. citizens to present their Social Security cards for this purpose," according to a Justice Department statement.
Under terms of the out-of-court settlement, Morton's agreed to provide full back pay of $2,880 and $5,715.62 to the employees, pay a $2,200 civil penalty and train Morton's employees in Portland on federal protections for workers against citizenship-status and national-origin discrimination. Morton's also agreed to properly train employees nationwide who have any role in evaluating someone's work eligibility.
Roger Drake, communications chief for Morton's, declined to comment on the case.

Abstract: With nearly five jobless workers for every job opening, their home states cutting staff and services and the outlook darkening, Congress--clearly noting public antipathy to government spending--has decided to talk about, not act on, reducing the budget deficit and go home for the summer. Business investment accounts for only 10% of gross domestic product, but moves up and down significantly with executives' outlook for the economy, the availability of credit and what John Maynard Keynes, the 20th-century economic giant, famously labeled "animal spirits," now known by the more clinical term "confidence."

Full text: Author: David Wessel
Optimistic forecasters say the U.S. economy is likely to grow at a bit better than a 3.5% annual pace over the next 12 months, but even they say that will leave unemployment at a still-high 9% or so a year from now. The moderately pessimistic, whose ranks are growing daily, foresee growth a full percentage point or more slower. The seriously pessimistic are talking "double dip."
A new Wall Street Journal survey finds that nearly half of 46 private forecasters queried said the U.S. won't return to 5.5% unemployment until 2015 or later.
The surest way to bring the unemployment rate down faster is for the U.S. economy to grow more rapidly. On that score, a scan of the economic landscape is discouraging.
Consumer spending? That seems unlikely to propel the economy to 4% or better growth if wage increases are scarce and Americans remain shell-shocked by the collapse in housing prices and the ups and downs of 401(k) retirement accounts. Housing? It may rebound in percentage terms, but from a very low level. Exports? The rising U.S. dollar and sluggishness in Europe don't bode well.
Government? The oomph from federal fiscal stimulus is fading, and Congress isn't interested in administering another dose. State and local governments, meanwhile, are cutting spending and raising taxes.
It's an extraordinary moment: With nearly five jobless workers for every job opening, their home states cutting staff and services and the outlook darkening, Congress--clearly noting public antipathy to government spending--has decided to talk about, not act on, reducing the budget deficit and go home for the summer. Federal Reserve officials are at least contemplating contingency plans, though Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke appears disinclined to do anything soon, given divergent views among his colleagues.
Which leaves business.
Business investment accounts for only 10% of gross domestic product, but moves up and down significantly with executives' outlook for the economy, the availability of credit and what John Maynard Keynes, the 20th-century economic giant, famously labeled "animal spirits," now known by the more clinical term "confidence." One thing--perhaps the only thing--that could quicken the pace of economic growth would be for businesses to turn optimistic and invest and hire.
That's why talk of big business being ticked off at President Barack Obama, and being somewhere between confused and outraged about tax, health, energy, environment and trade policy is more than just gossip. A lot of business executives seem to be at a tipping point. If they're feeling good and the economy is perking up, more will pursue new investment or hiring. If they're depressed by talk of double dip, fiscal austerity and beating up on business--whatever the merits of the specifics--they won't.
Other than attempts at smoothing executives' ruffled feathers with photo ops and task forces, what might government do to spur investment and hiring? The president, for good reason, is focused on vexing long-run problems like energy, climate change, immigration and education. But none of those are likely to produce more jobs and business investment in 2011.
The fundamental problem is clear. After a borrowing binge, the U.S., particularly consumers and financial firms, are trying to reduce their debts. The question is how fast to let that happen. The cold-turkey approach, a rapid deleveraging, means a very weak economy. Government policy has been aimed at slowing the pace of deleveraging by increasing government borrowing to offset shrinking private borrowing. Now that is no longer politically feasible.
"At a time when many people are trying to cut back in their personal lives, it is difficult to persuade the public that driving up the deficit is a good idea--even though it actually is a good idea, especially if combined with a clearer plan for long-term consolidation," Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius wrote recently.
If more deficit-widening stimulus is a non-starter, then what? Look for more politically palatable alternatives to gain favor if the economy deteriorates. The weaker the economy, for instance, the more likely Congress will be to renew the Bush tax cuts for a year despite the deficit talk, to avoid the braking effect of letting taxes rise in 2011.
There's talk in Washington about a federal highway and surface transportation bill, the one form of spending about which some deficit-phobes are enthusiastic. Or perhaps a public-private infrastructure fund of some sort that would leverage taxpayer money and draw some cash out of corporate coffers, and might help beleaguered state governments at the same time. Or, with BP replacing Goldman Sachs as the corporate villain of the month, perhaps there will be a move to raise taxes on oil companies (which might become a stealth gasoline tax) and use that money to cut other taxes to encourage hiring or business investment--a "deficit-neutral" way to spur growth.
Or perhaps there will be quiet talks with bank regulators about not moving too rapidly to implement new rules for banks being negotiated at Basel. Or perhaps there will be talk--never advertised, of course--of the administration backing away from tightening some regulations that, though popular with Democratic voters, may be more economically costly than proponents admit.
The moment for watchful waiting is passing.

Full text: Agim Sula was born in Thessaloniki, Greece in 1933.
He came to the United States in 1951 and earned a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University.
Agim loved his adopted country but there was always a special place in his heart for Albania.
Agim was a leader in the Albanian-American community in Chicago.
He fought tirelessly for Albanian National causes and was loyally devoted to King Leka.
Agim will be remembered as a beloved father figure for scores of Albanians who he helped immigrate to the U.S., taught them English, taught them to drive, found them their first jobs and much more.
He worked ceaselessly to help those in Albania get the medicine or special medical attention they desperately needed.
Until his dying day, Agim remained a beacon of light to his family, friends and anyone else lucky enough to know him.
Agim is survived by his wife, Norma; and his sons, Alexander, Daniel and Robert.
A visitation will be held Thursday, July 15, 2010, from 5 to 7 p.m., with service at 7 p.m. atEwing Funeral HomeChapel, Venice, FL.

Full text: Controversy doesn't find its way to tiny Homer Township in western Will County very often.
But this week, between discussions about new bike paths and parking lot repairs, the township's board of trustees took the unusual step to pass a resolution making English the official language of the township and throwing its support behind Arizona's recent effort to crack down on illegal immigrants.
It was largely a symbolic gesture because the township of about 30,000 has few official governing duties. But the move has created a buzz that officials there hope leads to a more serious debate about the issue at the county and state levels.
"I knew I was going to take some heat from this," said Steve Balich, the township's clerk and author of the resolution. "Illegal immigrants cost taxpayers money. If everybody stands up and says we want to adhere to the rule of law, the heat is going to die down for us all."
Trustee Vicki Bozen agreed, saying, "We would love this issue to explode throughout the nation."
Balich, who was elected township clerk last year and is a member of the county's local tea party movement, said the resolution wasn't aimed at singling out any one ethnic group. He said it was about enforcing the existing laws as they pertain to illegal immigration and encouraging the local school district to weed out those families living here illegally.
"We want the people who come to this country to become official U.S. citizens and to learn to speak English," Balich said.
Balich and Bozen said that illegal immigration isn't a serious problem in Homer Township, where Hispanics make up about 12 percent of the population, equal to the percent in Will County as a whole. Township documents are always printed in English, and nobody, to their knowledge, has ever requested otherwise.
Bozen called the resolution a proactive response to what's happening in the country. As such, it's not out of character for townships or municipalities to take stands on issues that don't pertain to them, said Jerry Crabtree, associate director of the Township Officials of Illinois.
"I've seen some resolutions where they've called for an end to the war or asked the president to get involved in something," said Crabtree. "It's local government, and sometimes political agendas are at the forefront. Although I'd like to see them sometimes focus on issues better than this."
Balich said he'd like to see the towns of Homer Glen, New Lenox and Lockport adopt similar resolutions, but he knows it won't be easy.
New Lenox Mayor Tim Baldermann said his village has issues more pressing than illegal immigration, but he does think it's time for a national debate.
"I certainly don't think what (Homer Township) did was inappropriate," Baldermann said. "But clearly this debate is a lot more complicated than some want to make it."

Abstract: The Iranian nuclear scientist who claimed to have been abducted by the CIA before departing for his homeland Wednesday was paid more than $5 million by the agency to provide intelligence on Iran's nuclear program, U.S. officials said. Amiri, 32, is known to have worked at Iran's Malek-e-Ashtar Industrial University, which U.S. intelligence agencies think is linked to the nation's Revolutionary Guard Corps, a powerful entity accused of activities ranging from weapons research to supporting terrorist groups.

Full text: The Iranian nuclear scientist who claimed to have been abducted by the CIA before departing for his homeland Wednesday was paid more than $5 million by the agency to provide intelligence on Iran's nuclear program, U.S. officials said.
Shahram Amiri is not obligated to return the money but might be unable to access it after breaking off what U.S. officials described as significant cooperation with the CIA and abruptly returning to Iran. Officials said he might have left out of concern that the Tehran government would harm his family.
"Anything he got is now beyond his reach, thanks to the financial sanctions on Iran," a U.S. official said. "He's gone, but his money's not. We have his information, and the Iranians have him."
Amiri arrived in Tehran early Thursday to a hero's welcome, including personal greetings from several senior government officials. His 7-year-old son broke down in tears as Amiri held him for the first time since his mysterious disappearance in Saudi Arabia 14 months ago.
In brief remarks, Amiri told reporters, "I am so happy to be back in the Islamic republic," and he repeated his claims of having been abducted by U.S. agents. He said CIA agents had tried to pressure him into making propaganda against his homeland and offered him $50 million to remain in the United States.
Amiri also said that he knew little of Iran's main nuclear enrichment site. "I'm a simple researcher. A normal person would know more about Natanz than me."
Amiri's request this week to be sent home stunned U.S. officials, who said he had been working with the CIA for more than a year.
Whether the agency received an adequate return on its investment in Amiri is difficult to assess. The size of the payment might offer some measure of the value of the information he shared. But it could also reflect a level of eagerness within the U.S. intelligence community for meaningful information on Iran.
The U.S. official said the payments reflected the value of the information gleaned. "The support is keyed to what the person's done, including how their material has checked out over time," said the official, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding the case. "You don't give something for nothing."
The transfer of millions of dollars into Amiri-controlled accounts also seems to bolster the U.S. government's assertions that Amiri was neither abducted nor brought to the United States against his will. Given the amount of money he was provided, a second U.S. official said, "I'm sure he could have been very happy here for a long time."
The payments are part of a clandestine CIA program referred to as the "brain drain." Its aim is to use incentives to induce scientists and other officials with information on Iran's nuclear program to defect.
The Iranian government maintains that its nuclear research is strictly for peaceful purposes. But the United States and other nations contend that Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear bomb. Acquiring intelligence on the country's nuclear capabilities and intentions is among the highest priorities for U.S. spy agencies.
Amiri, 32, is known to have worked at Iran's Malek-e-Ashtar Industrial University, which U.S. intelligence agencies think is linked to the nation's Revolutionary Guard Corps, a powerful entity accused of activities ranging from weapons research to supporting terrorist groups.
The scientist is not believed to have had direct access to Iran's most sensitive nuclear sites or leaders involved in decisions on whether to pursue a bomb. Still, officials said Amiri was valuable in confirming information from other sources and providing details on multiple nuclear facilities.
Iran has already begun to take advantage of the Amiri case, with state television echoing his claims that he was abducted and describing his return as a national victory. Awaiting Amiri at the airport Thursday were Hassan Qashqavi, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official, and other ministers.
The CIA has authority to bring as many as 100 people into the United States each year under a provision of the 1949 Central Intelligence Agency Act that enables the agency to bypass ordinary immigration requirements.
Promises of resettlement and reward money are two of the primary inducements used by the CIA to recruit informants inside "hard target" countries, including North Korea and Iran.
The money that went to Amiri was apparently placed in accounts or investment mechanisms that would sustain him over a lifetime in the United States. "You basically put together a long-term benefits package," one of the U.S. officials said.
Although Amiri might no longer be able to access the accounts, it was not clear whether the CIA would be able to reclaim the funds. The U.S. officials declined to disclose where the funds had been deposited.
State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley would not disclose Amiri's immigration status while he was in the United States or the reason he had been in the country. "He was here of his own volition and left of his own volition," Crowley said. "If he wants to talk about this, he can."
The CIA's payments to Amiri add to what has become one of the more bizarre recent episodes in espionage. Amiri disappeared in Saudi Arabia last summer and then resurfaced in a series of contradictory Internet videos this spring.
In some, he claimed to have been abducted, drugged and subjected to CIA torture to get him to talk. In another recording, apparently produced with help from the CIA, Amiri insisted that he had come to the United States of his own accord and said he was living in Tucson while pursuing a PhD.
One of the U.S. officials said Amiri's family was a main factor in his decision to return. "He just wanted to see his family and, unfortunately, he chose a dumb way to do it," the official said, "lying about what happened to him here to try to build up his credibility back home."

Cheney Recuperating
From Heart Surgery
Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Wednesday that he underwent successful surgery last week so doctors could implant a small pump in his heart.
In a statement, Mr. Cheney said he had a Left Ventricular Assist Device implanted, which he said will improve heart function and enable him to resume an active life.
The operation was done at Inova Fairfax Heart and Vascular Institute outside Washington, D.C.
In his statement, the former vice president, who is 69 years old, noted that he has dealt with heart disease for decades, having suffered his first of five heart attacks at age 37

Difficult Conditions Slow
Probe of Mine Accident
Difficult conditions inside the Upper Big Branch Mine in Montcoal, W.Va., have slowed the investigation into the nation's worst coal-mining disaster in 40 years and could delay a definitive report on the accident until year end, said a special investigator appointed by Gov. Joe Manchin.
Davitt McAteer, a former federal mine-safety official who was appointed shortly after the April 5 blast that killed 29 miners at the Massey Energy Co. mine, described the mine as "debris-strewn" and "very dark" with soot-covered walls caused by the explosion.
He said investigation teams have encountered dangerous roof conditions that had to be repaired, as well as water gathering in locations that hampered traveling in the mine.

CALIFORNIA
Mortgage Giants Face Suit
For Opposing Energy Loans
California Attorney General Jerry Brown filed a lawsuit Wednesday against mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their federal regulator over their opposition to a home energy-improvement program backed by the Obama administration.
The regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have said the programs don't have sufficient safeguards to ensure that homeowners have the ability to repay the new debt.
The program to encourage home-energy improvements, called Property Assessed Clean Energy, or PACE, allows municipalities to make loans through special property-tax assessments for homeowners to install solar panels, energy-efficient heating systems and other upgrades.
Representatives of Fannie, Freddie and the FHFA declined to comment Wednesday.

UTAH
Probe Begins Into Release
Of List Urging Deportations
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert's spokeswoman said it would likely be several days before it is known whether state workers leaked the personal information of more than 1,300 people who an anonymous group claims are illegal immigrants.
The group mailed the list to several media outlets, law enforcement agencies and others this week, demanding that those on the list be deported.
The list contains Social Security numbers, birth dates, workplaces, addresses and phone numbers.
Herbert spokeswoman Angie Welling said the governor didn't set a time frame for the investigation.

NEW YORK
18th Century Vessel Found
At World Trade Center Site
Workers excavating at the World Trade Center site have unearthed the 32-foot-long hull of a ship likely buried in the 18th century.
Archeologists say the vessel probably was used along with other debris to fill in land to extend lower Manhattan into the Hudson River.
Archeologists Molly McDonald and A. Michael Pappalardo were at the site of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on Tuesday morning when workers uncovered the artifacts. They call the find significant but say more study is needed to determine the age of the ship.
The two archeologists work for AKRF, a firm hired to document artifacts discovered at the site. They found a 100-pound boat anchor in the same area on Wednesday, but they are not sure if it belongs to the ship.

LOUISIANA
Three Police Officers Plead
Not Guilty in Shootings
Three police officers charged in the killing of two unarmed residents on a New Orleans bridge after Hurricane Katrina and a cover-up that followed pleaded not guilty on Wednesday.
Sgts. Robert Gisevius and Kenneth Bowen and Officer Anthony Villavaso stood before a federal magistrate in green prison garb, shackled at the waist and ankles. They will remain jailed at least until a hearing Friday. A tentative trial date is set for Sept. 13.
Magistrate Louis Moore Jr. read the counts -- 13 against Mr. Bowen, 11 against Mr. Gisevius and 10 against Mr. Villavaso. Former officer Robert Faulcon made his initial court appearance Tuesday in Texas, where he was arrested, but has not entered a plea.
The charges against the four carry a maximum sentence of life in prison or the death penalty, although U.S. Attorney Jim Letten said the Justice Department hasn't decided whether to seek the latter punishment.

CALIFORNIA
Assemblyman Ponders
Neverland as State Park
The former home of the King of Pop could become California's latest state park under an idea being floated by a California state lawmaker.
Assemblyman Mike Davis said he believes it is worth studying whether the California Department of Parks and Recreation should take over the Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County.
The Los Angeles legislator said fans world-wide would visit Michael Jackson's former estate. Mr. Jackson's 2,500-acre estate once housed amusement park rides and a zoo with tigers and snakes, but many of the estate's attractions were dismantled or sold after his death in 2009.
Colony Capital LLC, a Santa Barbara-based private-equity firm, took control of Neverland in a venture with Mr. Jackson after he nearly lost the estate to foreclosure.
Mr. Jackson signed over control of the estate to Colony Capital for $35 million in 2008. Colony spokesman Owen Blicksilver declined to comment on the proposal.

Full text: Optimistic forecasters say the U.S. economy is likely to grow at a bit better than a 3.5% annual pace over the next 12 months, but even they say that will leave unemployment at a still-high 9% or so a year from now. The moderately pessimistic, whose ranks are growing daily, foresee growth a full percentage point or more slower. The seriously pessimistic are talking "double dip."
In a new Wall Street Journal survey, nearly half of 46 private forecasters queried said the U.S. won't return to 5.5% unemployment before 2015.
The surest way to bring the jobless rate down faster is for the U.S. to grow more rapidly. That's hard.
Consumer spending: That seems unlikely to propel the economy to 4% or better growth if wage increases are scarce and Americans remain shell-shocked by the collapse in housing prices and the ups and downs of 401(k) retirement accounts. Housing: It may rebound in percentage terms, but from a very low level. Exports: The rising U.S. dollar and sluggishness in Europe don't bode well.
Government: The oomph from federal fiscal stimulus is fading, and Congress isn't interested in administering another dose.
It's an extraordinary moment: With nearly five jobless workers for every job opening, their home states cutting staff and services and the outlook darkening, Congress has decided to talk about, not act on, reducing the budget deficit, and go home for the summer.
Which leaves business.
Business investment accounts for only 10% of gross domestic product. But it moves up and down significantly with executives' outlook for the economy, the availability of credit and what John Maynard Keynes, the 20th-century economist, called "animal spirits," now known by the more clinical term "confidence." One thing that could quicken the pace of economic growth would be for businesses to turn optimistic.
That's why talk of big business being ticked off at President Barack Obama, and being somewhere between confused and outraged about tax, health, energy, environment and trade policy, is more than just gossip. A lot of executives seem to be at a tipping point. If they're feeling good and the economy is perking up, more will pursue new investment or hiring. If they're depressed by talk of a double-dip recession, fiscal austerity and beating up on business, they won't.
Other than attempts at smoothing executives' ruffled feathers with photo ops and task forces, what might government do to spur investment and hiring? The president, for good reason, is focused on vexing long-term problems like energy, climate change, immigration and education. But those aren't likely to produce more jobs and business investment in 2011.
The fundamental problem is clear in the chart above. (See accompanying chart -- WSJ July 15, 2010) After a borrowing binge, the U.S., particularly consumers and financial firms, are trying to reduce their debts. The question is how fast to let that happen. The cold-turkey approach, a rapid deleveraging, means a very weak economy. Government policy has been aimed at slowing the pace of deleveraging by increasing government borrowing to offset shrinking private borrowing. Now that is no longer politically feasible.
"At a time when many people are trying to cut back in their personal lives, it is difficult to persuade the public that driving up the deficit is a good idea -- even though it actually is a good idea, especially if combined with a clearer plan for long-term consolidation," Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius wrote recently.
If more deficit-widening stimulus is a nonstarter, then what? Look for more politically palatable alternatives to gain favor if the economy deteriorates. The weaker the economy, for instance, the more likely Congress is to renew the Bush tax cuts for a year.
There's talk in Washington about a federal highway and surface-transportation bill, the one form of spending about which some deficit-phobes are enthusiastic. Or perhaps a public-private infrastructure fund of some sort that would leverage taxpayer money and draw some cash out of corporate coffers. Or, with BP replacing Goldman Sachs as corporate villain, perhaps there will be a move to raise taxes on oil companies (which might become a stealth gasoline tax) and use that money to cut other taxes to encourage hiring or business investment -- a "deficit-neutral" way to spur growth.
Or perhaps the administration will back away from tightening some regulations that, though popular with Democratic voters, may be more economically costly than proponents admit.
The moment for watchful waiting is passing.

Full text: For Doug Lewis, the hook of Australian Rules Football was simple: he married a Sydneysider and wanted to impress her.
For Dan Lehane, the teenaged son of Irish immigrants, it was watching an International Rules Football series on TV, one between Aussie football players and Gaelic football players, where the Aussie players seemed to keep having their way with the fellows from his parents' country.
For Glenn Ormsby, there wasn't any need for a lure. He's Australian and Australian Rules football is in every good Aussie's blood. The blood that courses through their bodies and the stuff that spills out on the field.
"Come on, that's a bad rap. Broken bones and serious injury are not the norm," Mr. Lewis said, just before admitting he's broken his collarbone, several fingers and his nose on an Aussie Rules field, the last twice in the same week.
Mr. Lewis laughed, he protested that that injury tally wasn't bad for an 11-year career, and then the Brooklyn resident and hedge fund CFO said, "I promise, nobody wants to kill each other."
The World Cup is over, NFL training camps are still three weeks away and even without Cliff Lee, the Yankees' dominance makes baseball in this city ho-hum until October. Until then, there's a group of New Yorkers pitching another game, a spectacle so wild, it threatens to turn spectators into participants. After all, that's why they're playing.
Say hello to the New York Magpies, one of about 40 Australian Rules football teams in the country, playing under the auspices of the U.S.A.F.L. and on a field in Yonkers. Or out on Staten Island. Or in Hoboken.
Fields are definitely one of the biggest challenges in this area, if only because the game demands a grass playing surface only slightly smaller than a polo field. But challenge is relative to this group of about 50 men and 20 women, the regulars who train twice a week from February to October, travel the country and, yes, avoid detailing the sport's specifics to their parents and spouses.
"I sent my mom videos of some game footage, which was kind of a bad decision on my part," said Monica Robbins, a 27-year old who lives in Chelsea, works in advertising and was a volleyball player at Emory. She's played for two years with the Lady Magpies. She went on a tour of Australia with the U.S. national team, and her mom, she said, is slowly coming around. "She sees how much I love it."
Colloquially known as "footy," Australian Rules football is a little like every sport we know in America -- and unlike any one sport we know. The ball is a cross between a rugby ball and a football that just ate a really big meal. There are 18 players to a side, four goalposts (two tall, two shorter) and mass madness to get the ball around that vast field and through the two tallest goalposts. Mostly because the ball can't be thrown.
It can be kicked or bounced or handed off to another player, but that last part is like hot potato: five seconds -- or 15 meters -- and you have to get it to someone else. Handballs are legal, resembling sort of a volleyball dig except with much more heft and push.
There's tackling, only between the shoulders and the knees, there's lots of climbing over people and there's a spot for just about any sized athlete, a point waxed on about in the Adam Sandler movie "Funny People," albeit a bit more profanely.
"When I started playing, I still didn't completely understand it," Mr. Lewis said frankly. "I think what's attractive is it's very free-flowing, there's not a lot of restriction. There's no offsides and there's a lot of physical playing. It fills a void that exists here in New York City too. Maybe you have an office softball team, but that's not really competitive, like this."
The skills are ultimately largely transferable from sports like soccer, football and basketball. The pace of the game, however, is totally foreign. One moment you're pondering twirling blades of grass, the ball a far-off speck 20 first downs up field; 15 seconds later, the ball's zooming toward your feet. Or hands, if you're dexterous enough to "mark," which means catching the ball on the fly and then free kicking.
"We don't do that too much. At our level, the ball's on the ground a lot. Surprise, surprise," Ed McCormick said. The 42-year old has been playing with the Magpies for six years and is now the club's president. He's a managing director at a hedge fund in Connecticut, he lives in Hoboken and like most of the Magpies, he doesn't think seriousness about the game precludes fun.
"The skill of kicking a ball that's not round -- probably seriously, I couldn't really kick a ball three years in," he said. "But that doesn't mean you can't play. It means you can't kick it well."
About half the Magpies are Australian (only two of the Lady Magpies are) and Mr. Ormsby, a 29-year old vice president at SAC Capitol, doesn't mince words when he says this is a different footy than the one his compatriots play.
"It's a bit slower, the skills are a bit less and the Americans make some plays you wouldn't expect. For instance, when you're within scoring distance, the normal standard play would be to have a shot for goal. Here, some might pass it to someone in a worse position. They're more team oriented," he said. There isn't as much of that this year though: Mr. Ormsbey is doubling as a coach.
It's an extremely good-natured group, one where the Australians, Mr. McCormick said, "don't ever get on us for bastardizing their sport." Most of the players are in their late 20s or early 30s, though there are some outliers, like Mr. Lehane, who's just 16, and Norm Steiner, a 50-year old in IT sales.
Renting fields, getting uniforms, bringing in water, funding transportation to matches in Philadelphia, Boston and Baltimore, paying the certified umpires -- it all adds up.
The Magpies contribute between $500 and $1,000 to play each year, depending on what trips they take. They've been to Milwaukee, Austin, Pittsburgh and Chicago in the past and there's almost always a plane flight to the national championship. (New York doesn't have a large enough field to host the tourney).
Playing has become more than just recreation, bonding and black eyes today. Kevin Sheedy, a coach in the Australian Football League who Mr. McCormick likened to Bill Parcells, has been by to scout. Both Mr. McCormick and Mr. Ormsby said they believe Mr. Lehane, a soccer and basketball player at Regis High in Manhattan, could have a shot in an upcoming AFL draft.
Mr. Lehane says that was never his aim when he first came out to a practice as a 14-year old. His mother Margaret, who admits to thinking, "These guys are crazy" the first time she watched her son play, says future professional contract or not, the Magpies have been a boon for her son.
"These guys are a positive influence, they're really fantastic with Daniel," she said. "They really try to make him feel good about himself, they've been really good mentors and coaches."
And hey, if the AFL doesn't work for Daniel, Mr. McCormick has another plan. His two-year old son already has a little footy.
"He can't talk," Mr. McCormick said, "but he can kick a footy."

Full text: Even as the Obama administration cracks down on companies that hire illegal immigrants, it is simultaneously going after employers that it says go too far in vetting job applicants to ensure they are entitled to work in the U.S.
The Department of Homeland Security currently is auditing employment records of many companies suspected of hiring undocumented workers. Yet in an emerging paradox for businesses, the Justice Department and other agencies have stepped up probes of employers -- including restaurant groups, factories and retailers -- for allegedly violating anti-discrimination laws by demanding too many identity documents from applicants who aren't U.S. citizens.
To fend off lawsuits or enforcement actions, several companies have recently reached out-of-court settlements with the government; in some instances they paid fines.
"The message is: Employers beware," said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration-law scholar at Cornell University. "You need to worry just as much about asking for too many immigration documents as you do about not asking for enough."
The current tension arose from provisions in the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The IRCA prohibits employers from knowingly or intentionally hiring illegal immigrants; companies must verify a person's work eligibility through the "I-9" form process, in which new hires present identity documents and employers examine them for authenticity.
Anti-discrimination protections in the INA, meanwhile, guarantee "all individuals authorized to work in the U.S. have the right to seek employment without the added burden of special rules or document demands based on their citizenship status or national origin," said Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for civil rights. He said his unit is prioritizing enforcement of the INA provisions.
"The monkey is on the back of employers to make the call," said Mary Pivec, a Washington, D.C., attorney who is defending several companies with immigration-related problems. "We have more enforcement paired with insufficient and inconsistent guidance. Companies are in the crossfire."
By the end of 2010, the Justice Department will have boosted by 25% the total number of attorneys and investigators in its Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-related Unfair Employment Practices. The department doesn't disclose how many companies it is investigating, but a spokesperson didn't deny claims by immigration attorneys that there has been a surge in cases.
"The Obama administration has been much more active in enforcing the immigration law's anti-discrimination provisions than the Bush administration," Mr. Yale-Loehr said.
Companies face a maximum $1,100 civil monetary penalty for each individual from whom they demanded too many documents to prove work eligibility.
"It's a Catch-22," said Randy Johnson, senior vice president for labor and immigration at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the big business trade group. "Innocent employers get caught up in this snare of enforcement."
Businesses also face a proliferation of state laws designed to punish employers that hire undocumented immigrants. The U.S. Supreme Court is to consider this fall whether Arizona had the right to enact a 2007 law that empowers the state to revoke the business license of any employer found to knowingly hire illegal workers. The court is to determine whether federal immigration law preempts the state's statute.
On July 8, the Justice Department sued Garland Sales Inc., a rug manufacturer in Dalton, Ga., alleging it "engaged in a pattern of bias by imposing unnecessary and discriminatory hurdles" to employment for foreigners who were authorized to work in the U.S, according to a statement by the agency.
The government alleges that Garland required all non-U.S. citizens applying for jobs to present additional documents, in violation of the law. The Justice Department also said Garland "retaliated" against a naturalized U.S. citizen who has limited English skills by rescinding his job offer after he failed to produce a green card, which proves lawful U.S. residency for non-citizens. The person had presented a Social Security card and driver's license.
The company, which employs 300 people, denied the accusations and said it will defend itself.
"Garland Sales does not discriminate against individuals because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin in its hiring process and categorically denies the allegations," the rug maker said in a news release.
In late June, the Justice Department announced it had reached an agreement with Morton's Restaurant Group Inc. to settle allegations that an outlet in Portland, Ore., had required two noncitizens authorized to work in the U.S. to present more documents than legally required to establish their work eligibility. Both were fired after working for a time while the company reviewed their documentation.
"Morton's fired the workers after it rejected their valid Social Security cards and demanded to see additional documentation establishing their work authorization. In contrast, Morton's routinely permitted U.S. citizens to present their Social Security cards for this purpose," according to a Justice Department statement.
Under terms of the out-of-court settlement, Morton's agreed to provide full back pay of $2,880 and $5,715.62 to the employees, pay a $2,200 civil penalty and train Morton's employees in Portland on federal protections for workers against citizenship-status and national-origin discrimination. Morton's also agreed to properly train employees nationwide who have any role in evaluating someone's work eligibility.
Roger Drake, communications chief for Morton's, declined to comment on the case.

Full text: While I agree with many of the recommendations of Eli Lilly's CEO John C. Lechleiter ("America's Growing Innovation Gap," op-ed, July 9) for upgrading our science education, the major factors in the flight of American students from the sciences, engineering and math have been economic and academic difficulty compared to other disciplines. Other professions have proved more lucrative with lesser academic rigor required, including law and business. As a retired research chemist, I have seen a gradual downgrading of the image of science in the public eye, with both pay and the constant threat of layoffs. Research personnel are among the first to go when companies need to spend less.
When I mention to young or old friends that I majored in organic chemistry with a minor in physical chemistry, the almost universal response is that the field required too difficult academic work without the promise of financial reward.
Other professions are replete with the names of individuals who majored in the sciences and decided that other disciplines were more attractive -- to name a few, Margaret Thatcher, Angela Merkel and even former Mayor Marion Barry.
Is this a generation of Americans for whom the work ethic is less and academic challenges are to be avoided? I would hope not, but the evidence seems to show that this is the case as we fall further behind in technical fields required for economic growth.

Does medical innovation require a for-profit incentive, as Mr. Lechleiter asserts? Jonas Salk, inventor of the first successful polio vaccine, did not patent his enormously valuable product because he wished to minimize financial obstacles to universal immunization. Salk's research was funded by two organizations: the National Science Foundation, a federal agency created in 1950, and the March of Dimes, a not-for profit charity founded in 1938 (as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis).
The therapeutic effectiveness of breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) was proved in research conducted by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, a not-for-profit clinical trials cooperative founded five decades ago by the National Cancer Institute, another federal agency.
Medical research can be driven by the expectation of a patent and big profit. However, the polio vaccine and breast-conserving surgery are real world examples of innovation which do not fit into Mr. Lechleiter's formulation. The theory he proposes, for which he supplies no successful examples, should not be the basis for public policy.

Mr. Lechleiter has a program to restore America's leadership in innovation. I am afraid that he is way too late. I see scientific journals with not a single contribution from the U.S. All are from China, Taiwan, India and Japan and, by the way, written in impeccable English. The American education system is a train wreck.
As a British scientist immigrant who prospered in this wonderful country in the 20th century, I am sad to say that the 21st century will not be the "second American century" as far as innovation is concerned.

Abstract: (In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Butte had the second-largest Irish population outside Dublin.) Readers of "The Whistling Season" will be happy to reacquaint themselves with its engaging protagonist and first-person narrator, Morris (Morrie) Morgan, an itinerant school teacher, University of Chicago-educated polymath and all-around charmer.

Full text: In one of the memorable broadcast talks that did so much to confirm the late Patrick Kavanagh's reputation as a major poet, Seamus Heaney cannily observed that while the onetime County Monaghan farmer's focus was -- in the best sense -- parochial, his sensibility never was provincial.
Something similar could be said of the best American writing among the works we tend -- for no better reason than convenience -- to classify as "regional literature." Ivan Doig is an exemplary regional voice in American letters, which simply means he is a very fine writer who has chosen to site his work in the West, particularly in Montana, where he was born and grew up. "Work Song" is his 10th novel -- a sequel to his bestselling "The Whistling Season" -- and as enjoyable and subtly thought-provoking a piece of fiction as you're likely to pick up this summer. It's a book that can be appreciated just for the quality of the prose and the author's adherence to the sturdy conventions of old-fashioned narrative or for Doig's sly gloss on Western genre fiction and unforced evocation of our current condition -- or, better yet, for all those things.
Urban West
"Work Song" is set in the strife-torn year of 1919. World War I is newly over, and its veterans have returned to their jobs. The "Red Scare" has begun, and conflict between capital and labor is endemic with the radical International Workers of the World vying with more traditional trade unions for workers' loyalty. Doig again sets his story in Montana, but not the familiar "big sky country" with its rolling short grass prairies to the east and deep forested river valleys to the west. This story is played out entirely in the industrialized cities of Butte and Anaconda -- then the copper mining and smelting centers of a burgeoning U.S. economy.
This is the unfamiliar urban West, and the ranchers, farmers, cowboys and Native Americans who populate most fiction about the region are mentioned only in passing. Butte in those years was called "the richest hill on earth" and its people came from all the immigrant groups that had left their countries to do this nation's hard work, particularly underground -- the Irish, Welsh, Cornishmen and by 1919 the Ruthenians. (In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Butte had the second-largest Irish population outside Dublin.)
Readers of "The Whistling Season" will be happy to reacquaint themselves with its engaging protagonist and first-person narrator, Morris (Morrie) Morgan, an itinerant school teacher, University of Chicago-educated polymath and all-around charmer. (It's not necessary to have read the earlier novel, as "Work Song" artfully provides all the essential details.) The name, of course, is simply one of Morrie's disguises, for he's a fugitive twice over -- once from the Chicago gambling syndicate he and his boxer brother crossed and again from the Montana hamlet where he taught school and which he fled to disentangle himself from an impossible romance with his dead brother's widow, Rose, who locals believed was his sister.
In the intervening 10 years, Morrie has traveled the world and now has drifted back to Montana, partly in hope of recharging his finances in Butte, partly for proximity to Rose, now married. Unfortunately, the railroad's loss of Morrie's trunk means he has arrived in town carrying only a single satchel. That plus his having no visible means of support quickly attracts the attention of a pair of Anaconda Co. goons, who are convinced he's a "red" and "up to something." They'll dog his heels through much of the book.
One of this novel's pleasures is the rich cast of secondary characters Doig effortlessly sketches into his narrative. Grace, the attractive young widow who runs the boarding house where Morrie lands and the two elderly Welsh miners who are her other lodgers are among them. So too the unctuous Scandinavian mortician to whom Morrie applies for his first job in Butte in this memorable example of his charm:
"'My funerary experience is not vast,' I admitted, 'yet I have been fortunate enough to be an observer at some historically solemn occasions. I happened to witness the funeral procession of Edvard Grieg to name one.'
"'In Oslo?' He straightened up like a stork on the alert.'
"'There under the Scandinavian sky of heroes, with his own music resounding like the heartbeat of the fjords.'
"'What did they lay him in?' he whispered.
"'Rosewood,' came to mind.
"'The diamond of woods,' Peterson uttered with reverence. . ."
The Wobblies
Morrie is hired as a "cryer," the funeral home's official representative at the nightly wakes held by its mostly Irish clientele. It's a job that provides him with free drink and food and an introduction to the local miners and their union. Soon, however, he moves on to a position in the town library, which is run by Sam Sandison, a grandly imperious, bibliomaniacal ex-rancher, who secured the job by loaning his own vast collection of fine and rare books to form the nucleus of the public collection. The white-bearded Sandison is a figure of fear to the locals who, for reasons they refuse to discuss, refer to him as the "Earl of Hell." He makes Morrie his assistant, partly because Morrie's a walking literary encyclopedia and partly because his bookkeeping skills are useful to a boss who's been fiddling the budget to finance his passion for rare books.
Before long, Morrie -- who simply wants to stay out of harm's way and hit a few of the wagers he likes to place -- has encountered an ex-student of his, now herself a teacher, and her fiery fiance, leader of the local miners' union. They quickly enmesh Morrie in the never-ending struggle with the company and the vicious competition with the unseen but omnipresent Wobblies. Before the story resolves itself in a comprehensive but somewhat breakneck conclusion, the significance of the title will become clear, and Sandison -- who turns out to be a man with a terrible secret and a stricken conscience -- will come to play an unexpected, deeply satisfying role. To reveal more would spoil things, but keep in mind the year 1919 and the national pastime.
Morrie and Sanderson are, in some ways, a knowing inversion of the knight-errant, gun-slinging drifters and ranchers whom one finds in genre Westerns, while the organized miners in "Work Song" subtly play against the individualistic types that fill those conventional pages. The unseen antagonists in the Anaconda Co. executive suites high above Butte's turbulent streets manage to evoke something of our own financially troubled times. Doig, however, is too good a novelist to insist that those subtexts do more than whisper for themselves, and that tact makes "Work Song" a pleasure to read.

Full text: At its shows in Europe and across the United States the 11-piece orchestra La Excelencia is often introduced to audiences as personifying "salsa from New York." So it is paradoxical that on its home turf the band's hard, tough sound and fondness for lyrics that address social issues has led traditionalists to regard the group as somehow outside the salsa mainstream.
Rather than focus the spotlight on a nattily dressed and groomed lead singer, La Excelencia, which performs on Friday at Lincoln Center as part of Midsummer Night Swing, operates as a collective. Instead of writing treacly love songs, as demanded by the salsa romantica style that has been dominant for a quarter-century now, the group sings about immigration, discrimination and poverty. In place of synthesizers and strings, La Excelencia emphasizes hard-driving brass and percussion, just like a Fania Records band from salsa's heyday in the 1970s.
"La Excelencia represents something very significant, a return not just to the classic formula of salsa but to the virtues of it," said Aaron Levinson, a Grammy-winning producer best known for his work with the Spanish Harlem Orchestra. "It's one thing to bring back the campana and make it sound old school. But that's not all they are doing. The really critical difference is that they are also going back to the more eclectic period when salsa was street music, playing with spirit and integrity and writing socially relevant music again."
The throwback eclecticism of La Excelencia, founded in 2005 by the percussionists Jose Vazquez Cofresi and Julian Silva, extends to its makeup. Band members, who range in age from 26 to 35, are of Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Colombian, Argentine-Ecuadorean and Japanese descent (with a solitary Anglo trumpet player originally from Florida) and know how to fuse styles without making it apparent.
One of La Excelencia's signature songs, "La Lucha," or "The Struggle," blends Cuban danzon, Puerto Rican bomba and Colombian cumbia. "It is important for us to feature everybody in the band, and that our songs be for all of Latin America," said Mr. Vazquez, who plays conga. Mr. Silva, who plays timbales, added: "That's why we call it salsa. It's a mixture of everybody's music. Why would you want to limit yourself?"
Mr. Vazquez and Mr. Silva met as teenagers when both were part of a Roman Catholic youth delegation traveling to see Pope John Paul II during his 1993 visit to the United States. Mr. Vazquez, 34 and of Puerto Rican descent, was born in Biloxi, Miss., and grew up on the military bases in the South, where his father, an Air Force captain, was stationed. Mr. Silva, 32, was born in Cali, Colombia, but "political and drug violence there," he said, drove his family to immigrate to Baton Rouge, La., before he was 5.
Both were members of Los Calientes del Son, a band that toured the South, playing "everything from salsa and cumbia to rock, jazz and even country, just to be able to gig," recalled Mr. Vazquez, who has an accounting degree and handles the band's business affairs. But in 2000 they moved to New York and quickly signed a deal to record a salsa CD, only to see that project shelved as the reggaeton boom accelerated, which led to a request, soon granted, to be released from their contract.
"We got tired of the kind of rules that were placed on us because we were salsa," said Mr. Silva, who has a degree in psychology and has worked in cancer research at Mount Sinai Hospital. "We had to wear uniforms for the cover picture. We had to have the pretty boy singers. They were telling us to write about this and not about that, to sing about love and not protest, to cut our hair, look sharp and sing to the women. Jose and I just got fed up with it, and so we told the record label: 'You know what? We're out, we're done, we don't want to be part of this.' "
On its own Handle With Care label La Excelencia has released two CDs whose titles give a sense of the group's philosophy: "Salsa con Conciencia," which means salsa with "awareness" or "conscience," and "Mi Tumbao Social," or "My Social Drumbeat." The band has also used YouTube, Facebook, MySpace and other social media extensively to promote its music. In addition the BBC has released a DVD of a performance in January at the Barbican in London, though that is still unavailable in the United States.
"One thing I like about this band is that you don't get the feeling they are in this to get rich or be the next big thing," said the composer, producer and musicologist Ned Sublette. "This is a fiesta popular. They seem to be about roots, about continuing the tradition and moving it forward, unlike the salsa lite that's on the radio. And I also like the fact they are a real working band with consistent membership, which is hard to do in New York."
Commercially, however, the path the band has chosen is an uphill one. La Excelencia's insistence on "doing what we want the way we want it and not worrying about anything else," as Mr. Silva puts it, has won the band a dedicated following but not huge acclaim or success. Neither CD has yet sold more than 15,000 copies, though they have flourished as digital downloads.
"As far as Latin radio in the U.S. is concerned, the market for what they do is practically nonexistent, extinct," said Sergio George, the producer and arranger best known for his work with Marc Anthony and other salsa romantica artists. "This is a band that for sure can succeed in festivals in Europe, because over there a great community supports that kind of thing. But in the U.S. it's tough sledding."
La Excelencia tries to compensate for that with a dynamic live show, meant to draw young listeners whose attitude, as Mr. Silva describes it, is likely to be: "Salsa? That's my dad's music. My grandfather listened to that stuff." On "Unidad," for instance, Mr. Vazquez takes his drum out into the audience, and others in the band follow.
The older, more established generation of salsa musicians and promoters appears to have an ambivalent attitude about the group. Rafael Ithier, leader of El Gran Combo of Puerto Rico, perhaps the genre's most popular and respected working band, has emerged as a patron, going so far as to call publicly late last year for salsa fans "to support the boys in La Excelencia."
But New York club owners often complain about the band's insistence on wearing sneakers and street clothes onstage, instead of the fancy shoes and suits that are almost obligatory. And members of some other local bands have been known to grumble that La Excelencia sounds "too Colombian," by which they mean that the group plays too fast for their taste and is too brassy, in the style of Grupo Niche.
"I really don't agree with that," said Pablo Yglesias, author of "The Rough Guide to Salsa" and other books. "The truth is that La Excelencia is a mixture of the retro and the contemporary. I think they just see themselves as playing great music and not caring about fashion, so they are fresh that way."

For Doug Lewis, the hook of Australian Rules Football was simple: he married a Sydneysider and wanted to impress her.
For Dan Lehane, the teenaged son of Irish immigrants, it was watching an International Rules Football series on TV, one between Aussie football players and Gaelic football players, where the Aussie players seemed to keep having their way with the fellows from his parents' country.
For Glenn Ormsby, there wasn't any need for a lure. He's Australian and Australian Rules football is in every good Aussie's blood. The blood that courses through their bodies and the stuff that spills out on the field.
"Come on, that's a bad rap. Broken bones and serious injury are not the norm," Mr. Lewis said, just before admitting he's broken his collarbone, several fingers and his nose on an Aussie Rules field, the last twice in the same week.
Mr. Lewis laughed, he protested that that injury tally wasn't bad for an 11-year career, and then the Brooklyn resident and hedge fund CFO said, "I promise, nobody wants to kill each other."
The World Cup is over, NFL training camps are still three weeks away and even without Cliff Lee, the Yankees' dominance makes baseball in this city ho-hum until October. Until then, there's a group of New Yorkers pitching another game, a spectacle so wild, it threatens to turn spectators into participants. After all, that's why they're playing.
Say hello to the New York Magpies, one of about 40 Australian Rules football teams in the country, playing under the auspices of the U.S.A.F.L. and on a field in Yonkers. Or out on Staten Island. Or in Hoboken.
Fields are definitely one of the biggest challenges in this area, if only because the game demands a grass playing surface only slightly smaller than a polo field. But challenge is relative to this group of about 50 men and 20 women, the regulars who train twice a week from February to October, travel the country and, yes, avoid detailing the sport's specifics to their parents and spouses.
"I sent my mom videos of some game footage, which was kind of a bad decision on my part," said Monica Robbins, a 27-year old who lives in Chelsea, works in advertising and was a volleyball player at Emory. She's played for two years with the Lady Magpies. She went on a tour of Australia with the U.S. national team, and her mom, she said, is slowly coming around. "She sees how much I love it."
Colloquially known as "footy," Australian Rules football is a little like every sport we know in America--and unlike any one sport we know. The ball is a cross between a rugby ball and a football that just ate a really big meal. There are 18 players to a side, four goalposts (two tall, two shorter) and mass madness to get the ball around that vast field and through the two tallest goalposts. Mostly because the ball can't be thrown.
It can be kicked or bounced or handed off to another player, but that last part is like hot potato: five seconds--or 15 meters--and you have to get it to someone else. Handballs are legal, resembling sort of a volleyball dig except with much more heft and push.
There's tackling, only between the shoulders and the knees, there's lots of climbing over people and there's a spot for just about any sized athlete, a point waxed on about in the Adam Sandler movie "Funny People,'' albeit a bit more profanely.
"When I started playing, I still didn't completely understand it," Mr. Lewis said frankly. "I think what's attractive is it's very free-flowing, there's not a lot of restriction. There's no offsides and there's a lot of physical playing. It fills a void that exists here in New York City too. Maybe you have an office softball team, but that's not really competitive, like this."
The skills are ultimately largely transferable from sports like soccer, football and basketball. The pace of the game, however, is totally foreign. One moment you're pondering twirling blades of grass, the ball a far-off speck 20 first downs up field; 15 seconds later, the ball's zooming toward your feet. Or hands, if you're dexterous enough to "mark," which means catching the ball on the fly and then free kicking.
"We don't do that too much. At our level, the ball's on the ground a lot. Surprise, surprise," Ed McCormick said. The 42-year old has been playing with the Magpies for six years and is now the club's president. He's a managing director at a hedge fund in Connecticut, he lives in Hoboken and like most of the Magpies, he doesn't think seriousness about the game precludes fun.
"The skill of kicking a ball that's not round--probably seriously, I couldn't really kick a ball three years in," he said. "But that doesn't mean you can't play. It means you can't kick it well."
About half the Magpies are Australian (only two of the Lady Magpies are) and Mr. Ormsby, a 29-year old vice president at SAC Capitol, doesn't mince words when he says this is a different footy than the one his compatriots play.
"It's a bit slower, the skills are a bit less and the Americans make some plays you wouldn't expect. For instance, when you're within scoring distance, the normal standard play would be to have a shot for goal. Here, some might pass it to someone in a worse position. They're more team oriented," he said. There isn't as much of that this year though: Mr. Ormsbey is doubling as a coach.
It's an extremely good-natured group, one where the Australians, Mr. McCormick said, "don't ever get on us for bastardizing their sport." Most of the players are in their late 20s or early 30s, though there are some outliers, like Mr. Lehane, who's just 16, and Norm Steiner, a 50-year old in IT sales.
Renting fields, getting uniforms, bringing in water, funding transportation to matches in Philadelphia, Boston and Baltimore, paying the certified umpires --it all adds up.
The Magpies contribute between $500 and $1,000 to play each year, depending on what trips they take. They've been to Milwaukee, Austin, Pittsburgh and Chicago in the past and there's almost always a plane flight to the national championship. (New York doesn't have a large enough field to host the tourney).
Playing has become more than just recreation, bonding and black eyes today. Kevin Sheedy, a coach in the Australian Football League who Mr. McCormick likened to Bill Parcells, has been by to scout. Both Mr. McCormick and Mr. Ormsby said they believe Mr. Lehane, a soccer and basketball player at Regis High in Manhattan, could have a shot in an upcoming AFL draft.
Mr. Lehane says that was never his aim when he first came out to a practice as a 14-year old. His mother Margaret, who admits to thinking, "These guys are crazy" the first time she watched her son play, says future professional contract or not, the Magpies have been a boon for her son.
"These guys are a positive influence, they're really fantastic with Daniel," she said. "They really try to make him feel good about himself, they've been really good mentors and coaches."
And hey, if the AFL doesn't work for Daniel, Mr. McCormick has another plan. His two-year old son already has a little footy.
"He can't talk," Mr. McCormick said, "but he can kick a footy."

PHOENIX--A lawyer for a Phoenix police officer told a federal court Thursday his client could be sued for racial profiling if he enforces Arizona's new immigration law. It is the first hearing in a series of legal challenges filed over the controversial crackdown which has divided law enforcement in the state and across the country.
Officer David Salgado, a 19-year veteran of the Phoenix police department, could also lose his job if he fails to enforce the new law, his attorney said.
Arizona's statute requires an officer to verify the immigration status of a person stopped for other alleged crimes, if "reasonable suspicion" exists of illegal presence in the U.S.
But the law also empowers Arizona residents to sue an officer they believe isn't enforcing the law to the fullest extent.
"If he enforces the law, he can be sued. If he doesn't enforce the law, he can be sued" by a private citizen, said Stephen Montoya, the attorney for Mr. Salgado. His client "is caught between a rock and a hard place," he said.
Mr Montoya also argued that the law, which makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally, usurps federal authority over immigration. "The state of Arizona cannot order its employees to violate federal law," he said.
Attorneys for Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer told the judge that the lawsuit, which was also filed by an advocacy group called Chicanos Por La Causa, should be dismissed because the police officer and the group have no valid claim of immediate harm and the state law doesn't trump federal immigration law.
Outside the courthouse, in 105-degree heat, about 50 protesters and supporters of the law gathered; police kept the two sides apart.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton did not rule on whether to dismiss the challenge or block the law from being enforced. Unless an injunction is issued by a federal judge, the law will go into effect on July 29.
Hearings on at least two of the six other lawsuits, including one filed by the Obama administration, are scheduled for next week. One of the six suits was filed by another police officer, Martin Escobar. Mr. Escobar, who patrols a heavily Hispanic enclave in Tucson, the state's second-largest city, claims in the lawsuit that he would lose the cooperation of Latino witnesses, which he said was a key to solving crimes.
Separately, two Arizona county sheriffs announced the establishment of a legal fund to raise money to defend themselves and their deputies against lawsuits.
In May, police chiefs from Phoenix, Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia and other large cities met with Attorney General Eric Holder to voice concern that the law will drive a wedge between police and immigrant communities, drain resources and undermine public safety. Legislators in several states have begun to draft laws similar to that of Arizona.
But some police officers and sheriffs in Arizona, the country's busiest corridor for human and narcotic smuggling, say the law gives them an additional tool to tackle illegal immigration.
Law enforcement officers, who can decide when to arrest or shoot someone, should also be trusted to enforce the new law without profiling based on race, said Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, whose jurisdiction covers a vast area between the Mexican border and Phoenix. "I believe in my deputies' professionalism," he said.
Currently, only 11 Pinal County deputies are cross-trained under a federal program that empowers some local law enforcement to help identify illegal immigrants.
"Now, all 214 of my deputies will have the authority" to round up those suspected of being here illegally, Mr. Babeu said.
The offices of Sheriff Babeu and nearby Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever are named in a lawsuit recently filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. On Thursday, they announced they had started a legal fund, with the support of a non-profit group, Legacy Foundation, to help defend them against lawsuits.
"People will be lining up to sue us for racial profiling," said Mr. Dever. "It's an insult to the rank-and-file deputies who know how to operate within the parameters expected of them."
Ms. Brewer has also hired a private attorney to represent her in the lawsuits.
Ms. Brewer has said racial profiling won't be tolerated. After signing the bill on April 23, she ordered the state's police training and licensing board to develop a program that sets standards for enforcement to prevent profiling.

If President Obama is serious about a comprehensive immigration reform, he'll need to overcome two big problems: our softening competitive edge in the global market, and the hostile attitudes many Americans have about immigration. The way out? Establish a strong rationale for immigration that's linked to our self-interest in innovation and long-term economic development.
In the years leading up to World War II, the United States recruited Europe's top talent for our nuclear program. Scientists such as Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and Edward Teller immigrated to America and played an instrumental role in securing our country's future and developing its nuclear advantage.
Today, we need to think about a new "Einstein Principle" for our immigration policy. It would make brains, talent and special skills a priority. The point is to attract more individuals with the potential to enhance American innovation and competitiveness, increasing the odds for economic prosperity and rising living standards for all down the road.
At a time of high unemployment, the most pressing need is for more innovators who will start new businesses and create high-paying jobs. We've certainly done so successfully in the past.
A Duke University study by Vivek Wadhwa found that 25% of all the technology and engineering businesses launched in the U.S. between 1995 and 2005 had a foreign-born founder. In Silicon Valley, that number was 52.4%. Much of the high-tech boom of recent years has rested on immigrant entrepreneurship.
Yet only 15% of our annual visas are now set aside for employment purposes. Of these, some go to seasonal agricultural workers, while a small number of H-1B visas (65,000) are reserved for "specialty occupations" such as scientists, engineers, and technological experts.
The number reserved for scientists and engineers is drastically below the figure allowed between 1999 and 2004. In that interval, the U.S. federal government set aside up to 195,000 visas each year for H-1B entry. The idea was that scientific innovators were so important for long-term economic development that we needed to boost the number let in.
Meanwhile, other countries have taken the lead. Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, for example, are more strategic in viewing immigration as a way to attract foreign talent. Canada, for instance, explicitly targets foreign workers in short supply who can contribute to their economy. It admits around 265,000 immigrants each year. Of these, 154,000 visas (58%) are set aside for economic purposes, such as skilled workers or live-in caregivers, while 71,000 (26%) are devoted to family reunification.
Canada's percentages are nearly the reverse of national policy in the U.S. Here, nearly two-thirds of visas (64%) are devoted to family reunification, whereby foreigners who have come to America and become citizens can sponsor spouses, parents, children, brothers and sisters for citizenship. Unlike other countries whose leaders understand the value of skilled and seasonal labor for long-term economic development, we continue to place a very low priority on admitting immigrants with economic talents.
One of the virtues of the Canadian approach is that immigration is far less controversial among its general public--because people see how newcomers strengthen the national economy. With benefits widely understood, immigration is perceived as being very favorable for the country as a whole. In the U.S., the Gallup Organization has found that 52% of Americans say they want to decrease immigration; while in Canada, only 27% feel that way. Canadians embrace immigration because they understand how new arrivals benefit their country.
Unfortunately, the U.S. has put itself in an impossible position from the standpoint of public opinion. It admits a large number of legal immigrants who may or may not add to our prosperity and has lots of illegal ones on top of that. Instead of viewing immigration as a brain gain, ordinary folks see the economic and social costs as broad, and the benefits as narrow.
If we expect more Americans to support immigration, it must be obvious to them what the national benefits are. The problem with today's policies is that they focus public and media attention much more on immigrant costs than benefits. That explains why no one likes the status quo, but comprehensive reform is so difficult to enact.
Mr. West is vice president of governance studies and director of the Center of Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution. He is the author of "Brain Gain: Rethinking U.S. Immigration Policy" (Brookings, 2010).

If Queens were a separate city, it would be neck and neck with Houston as the fourth largest in the U.S., with a population of 2.3 million. Yet the borough has had only one regional shopping mall--until now.
In the business district of Flushing, one of the densest areas in New York City, Sky View Center, an 800,000-square-foot shopping mall, has started to open its doors.
Flushing already has hundreds of local stores and its position as a transportation hub--the No. 7 subway, city buses and the Long Island Railroad all meet in the heart of downtown Flushing--means that more than 100,000 people pass through daily, including residents of downtown Flushing and commuters who work and shop in the area.
Even though the new mall will increase congestion in an area already packed with pedestrians and cars, there are residents are looking forward to having more national retailers locally. The only regional mall in Queens currently is Queens Center in Elmhurst.
"People are happy to have them because we [often] have to go to Long Island, Manhattan or New Jersey to buy something," said Fred Fu, president of Flushing Development Center, a nonprofit that hosts cultural events in Flushing.
Though it is too early to tell whether the area's many small, mostly Asian, businesses will be affected, Mr. Fu suggests that the new mall will benefit existing business owners.
"The new stores will generate more customers for the small businesses. People from Long Island City, Jamaica, and Bayside will come here to buy," he says.
Sky View Center is already 75% leased with three big box stores--BJ's Wholesale Club, Best Buy and Bob's Discount Furniture Store--already open. Target is expected to open in October. Also in the fall, Marshall's, Old Navy and Bed Bath & Beyond will open their doors.
Once the development is completed in 2011, additional tenants will include Famous Footwear, Five Guys Burger and Fries, numerous restaurants and a Sky Foods Supermarket--an Asian family-owned chain.
"There is no shortage of patrons to Flushing, but it is dramatically underserved from a retail and residential perspective," said Michael Dana, president of Onex Real Estate Partners and developer of the project. Forest Hills-based Muss Development LLC is co-owner of the project.
The shopping mall is just one part of the mixed-used development, Sky View Parc, which will eventually be home to more than 1,000 families with three of six planned housing towers to be completed this year. Units from studios to three-bedroom condominiums will be priced from $385,000 to more than $1 million.
The project is attracting a mix of local single and family buyers looking for more lifestyle amenities and service, as well as empty nesters and first-time home buyers.
Big-name retailers could be found in Flushing until the late 1980s. Some started to depart after Asian immigrants--who didn't shop at the stores enough because there weren't many products that catered to them--moved into the area. "Now is the time for the big businesses to come back because the economy [in Flushing] is booming," said Mr. Fu.
Two national chains have been in the district on Roosevelt Avenue for years, A Macy's store is approximately 50 years old and Old Navy has been there for nearly 10 years.
"They have shown these types of business can succeed in a community that is a certain type of ethnicity," said Ricardi Calixte, director of neighborhood economic development at the Queens Economic Development Corp. "It's a sign of what's to come."

New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said Thursday he agreed to host a gathering of leaders from the United States and Mexico after their yearly border conference was canceled by the Arizona governor amid threats of a boycott by Mexican politicians.
But the governors of Texas and Arizona said they wouldn't attend--another sign of growing discord over immigration policies on both sides of the border.
"Obviously, all border governors are welcome and encouraged to attend, although the governors of Arizona and Texas have said they are not interested in joining a dialogue with their border colleagues," Gilbert Gallegos, a spokesman for Mr. Richardson, said Thursday.
The Border Governors Conference, which has been held 27 times, was scheduled to take place in Phoenix in September. But after Arizona passed its hotly debated illegal immigration law this year, the Mexican delegation refused to set foot in the state. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican up for reelection, cancelled the event late last month.
Beyond immigration, elected officials along the international border have a crowded list of issues that range from commercial trucks stuck at checkpoints to cattle pests that too easily gain entry.
Although states in both countries defer to their federal governments in most cross-border issues, the conference has been a forum to exchange information, participants say.
For months, delegates from the border states' economic development departments and environmental agencies, police forces and tourism offices, have been sitting at 13 "work tables" to come up with ways to cooperate on a variety of fronts.
The Arizona law, which requires police to inquire on the legal status of people they stop for other alleged crimes, was not on their agenda.
The law has been widely criticized in Mexico, where several border states held elections earlier this month. On the U.S. side of the border, all four governorships are up for grabs in November, and the ongoing immigration debate is galvanizing Democrat and GOP voters alike.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, who is vacating office, said that he would attend the gathering no matter where it was held. Ms. Brewer and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another Republican up for reelection, have said that they would not.
At delegate work tables, where staffers and others perform much of the actual substantive work on cross-border problems for the conference, some participants lament that politics is getting in the way of their task. Still, they are ready to deliver their recommendations regardless of who shows up in Santa Fe.
"If we don't work together we are totally failing," said Francisco Marmolejo, a professor at the University of Arizona who co-chairs the science and technology committee.

Full text: PHOENIX -- Partisans in the debate over Arizona's stringent immigration law squared off for the first time in federal court Thursday, providing an early glimpse into the legal arguments that will be used in the coming battle over the new law.
Judge Susan Bolton of Federal District Court, in a hearing on a challenge to the law brought by a Phoenix police officer, did not issue a ruling but reacted to the arguments of both sides with skepticism and pointed questions. She has said she could not promise to rule before July 29, when the law takes effect, and at one point Thursday archly noted that the Justice Department would be in her courtroom next week making some of the same arguments against the law.
But the hearing did suggest possible difficulties for both sides in court as they debated the law, which requires the police to check the immigration status of people they stop or arrest if they suspect they are in the country illegally.
"I thought the state wanted to assist the federal government in doing a task they are not entirely successfully doing," Judge Bolton told Stephen Montoya, a lawyer for a Phoenix police officer who challenged the law as unconstitutional and likely to force him to racially profile.
"The federal government does not want that assistance," Mr. Montoya countered, noting the Justice Department lawsuit rests largely on the ground that the state is intruding on federal authority. "And they are unequivocal in not wanting that assistance. The best response to that argument after the federal government sued is to laugh."
Mr. Montoya said that the federal government already has special programs in which state and local governments can participate in immigration enforcement and that the Arizona law, by imposing state sanctions, levies punishments on immigrants they would not face in other states.
"The true evil" of the law, he said, "is that it is divisive. We can't have 50 immigration laws."
Questioning John Bouma, a lawyer for Gov. Jan Brewer, Judge Bolton asked if the state law was "an attempt to get around the fact that Arizona cannot have an alien registration law?"
Mr. Bouma said Congress intended states to play a role and "just leaving it in the status quo leaves the state of Arizona in economic harm, in irreparable harm, every day" from associated costs. "This particular executive branch does not want assistance," he said. "They want to do it their own way."
The lawyers and judge also sparred over whether the officer, David Salgado, and a social service organization, Chicanos por la Causa, could bring a case before the law takes effect.
Lawyers for the state said previous rulings would not allow it, but Mr. Montoya argued Mr. Salgado was under "genuine threat" of being fired if he did not enforce the law or could be sued by people who claim their race or ethnicity motivated his check.
"Is there a genuine threat?" she asked in a tone tinged with disbelief.
"Absolutely," Mr. Montoya replied, going on to explain further Mr. Salgado's perceived dilemma.
The Arizona Supreme Court has allowed race to be considered when making an immigration stop, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has ruled in a different case that race or ethnicity cannot be considered, Mr. Montoya said.
"Who is Officer Salgado going to obey, the Arizona Supreme Court, which says it can be a factor, or the Ninth Circuit, which says race can't be used?" he asked.

Abstract: Not only is this manifestly incorrect," the panel wrote in a pointed footnote, after vacating the deportation order, "but the government's failure to assist the court in evaluating the specifics of petitioner's argument required the court to conduct a special, searching analysis of petitioner's contentions before, during and after oral argument.

Full text: Saying that government lawyers let their zeal for victory in a deportation case outweigh their responsibility to be fair, a federal appeals court last week ordered the United States to provide a haven for a woman facing the likelihood of torture in China.
The woman, Jinyu Kang, an ethnic Korean citizen of China who now lives in New York, had fled a Chinese arrest warrant for giving food and shelter to Korean refugees. Others named in the same warrant and caught by the Chinese police had described beatings, suffocation, electric shocks, sleep deprivation and other forms of torture to get them to disclose details about the human rights group to which they all belonged.
"It is disappointing, even shocking, that the government fails to acknowledge that the evidence is not only strongly in Kang's favor, but, indeed, compels the conclusion that she will likely be tortured," said the decision, issued by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which covers Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the United States Virgin Islands.
The decision details "the horrific experiences" suffered by members of the group, and cites testimony that Ms. Kang's son, who is still in China, was also tortured by the police during interrogation about his mother's whereabouts. (Ms. Kang declined to talk about the case with a reporter through her lawyer, Man C. Yam.)
An immigration judge granted Ms. Kang protection under the Convention Against Torture in 2008. But lawyers for the government appealed, and the Board of Immigration Appeals overturned the decision. The Third Circuit judges called the government's position "inexplicable" and said both the board and the government lawyers ignored overwhelming evidence.
A Justice Department spokeswoman, Xochitl Hinojosa, declined to comment on the appeals court's decision.
But legal scholars and immigration lawyers said the Kang decision was one in a series of recent federal court rulings criticizing lawyers for the department's Office of Immigration Litigation who defend immigration decisions regardless of the merits.
Another Third Circuit panel last week slapped the government for arguing that the court had no jurisdiction to consider the case of an impoverished legal immigrant who had been ordered deported without being told of the availability of free legal help, contrary to court rules.
"Not only is this manifestly incorrect," the panel wrote in a pointed footnote, after vacating the deportation order, "but the government's failure to assist the court in evaluating the specifics of petitioner's argument required the court to conduct a special, searching analysis of petitioner's contentions before, during and after oral argument."
In May, the conservative United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, based in Richmond, Va., chided the government for defending a decision based on a government mix-up between unrelated cases. A Chinese father who had provided detailed evidence to support his account of his wife's forced abortion and the threat of sterilization had been denied asylum based on the "vagueness" of material from someone else's file; despite admitting the mistake, the government argued that the decision should be upheld anyway.
Gerald L. Neuman, a professor of law at Harvard, said that some court decisions faulted a lack of attention linked to huge immigration caseloads, but he added that the Office of Immigration Litigation was also known as "extremely zealous," and that the Kang decision went to the larger question of how that squared with the ethical duties of government lawyers.
Based on the evidence, the court said, the government should have supported Ms. Kang's petition.
"Instead, the government sought to characterize the facts in such a way so as to distract the court from the dire nature of Kang's plight," Judge Marjorie O. Rendell wrote. "While our adversarial system may permit such advocacy by private parties, when the United States appears before us, it is duty-bound to 'cut square corners' and seek justice rather than victory. We are distressed that it failed to do so."
Lucas Guttentag, who directs the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project and teaches at Yale Law School, said in an e-mail message that the critique "confirms the critical importance of judicial oversight over immigration deportation decisions, and exposes the desperate need for the Obama Justice Department to clean house and assert effective supervision over the Office of Immigration Litigation."

Full text: For years she picked up trash, tidied picnic tables, manned the snack bar and set up park events for the city of Bell. Rosario Torres' $9-an-hour job came with no benefits, but it helped support her family of seven. When she was laid off in 2008, she applied for another city job but never heard back.
Now, reports that Bell city officials are among the most highly compensated municipal employees in the nation has left Torres disgusted. The 36-year-old said she cannot fathom how the city manager earns nearly $800,000 in the same tiny working-class town where she struggles to find employment.
"They said there was no budget for me," Torres said Thursday afternoon, sitting with her children at one of the parks she used to clean. "Now I can't pay my bills. I only pay for water, gas and electricity, and those are late. I'm angry. There need to be changes; they need to find jobs for people here."
The Times reported Thursday that Chief Administrative Officer Robert Rizzo earns nearly twice the salary of President Obama, Police Chief Randy Adams about 50% more than Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck and Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia more than the chief executive for Los Angeles County.
Rizzo was unapologetic, saying he could earn just as much in private business. Several council members said Rizzo had saved the city from near bankruptcy and was worth every penny of his salary.
A community of 36,000, Bell is predominantly Latino, its ethnic roots evident in the markets and panaderias that line its main thoroughfares. Mom-and-pop auto businesses, coin laundries and beauty salons dot the city, located southeast of downtown, where the Los Angeles River cuts beneath the 710 Freeway.
Here, the notion of six-figure incomes contrasts sharply with modest neighborhoods of simple one-story homes and worn-out, littered strip malls. The median income is about $40,000, and 65% of residents over 25 do not have a high school diploma.
Many said they were forced to look for jobs in neighboring cities or get by on part-time work.
"It's a blue-collar city. A lot of people are just trying to make ends meet," said Bell resident Victor Munoz, who said he was laid off from his telecommunications job last year and is now taking pharmacy technician classes.
Munoz, 42, has lived in the area for decades and says the immigrant community is largely unaware of what happens at City Hall.
"They don't know or they don't understand it," he said. "Because of the language barrier or their schooling, they don't always comprehend what's going on."
Bell is being investigated by the Los Angeles County district attorney over the compensation of its City Council members, who receive about $100,000 a year for their part-time positions. In a city the size of Bell, a council member is typically paid about $400 a month, according to state records.
Assemblyman Hector De La Torre (D-South Gate), who wrote a 2005 bill that limited some city council salaries, expressed outrage over the salaries of Bell's top administrators.
"The president of the United States and other public servants who oversee much more complicated and sophisticated operations make much less than these city officials," he said. "I think that makes it really clear these salaries are overdone."
The City Council, he said, "is completely avoiding their fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayer."
Bell city employees are tight-lipped, saying they're not allowed to speak about the subject, and employees of a grocery owned by Mayor Oscar Hernandez asked a reporter to leave.
Residents, however, have no problem expressing what they think about their city's budget, which pays the police chief -- who oversees a 46-person department -- $457,000 a year. By contrast, Los Angeles' police chief oversees 12,899 people and earns $307,000.
Maricela Morales, a single mother of three who works as a medical assistant at a clinic, said the news about her city was disheartening at a time when she was seeking a second job to help make the rent.
"That is too much for them," she said. "And I wonder how I'm going to support my children."
Christian Andrade, 32, who earns $10 an hour as a waiter at a Mexican restaurant, said that he often worried about making the out-of-pocket health insurance payments for his wife and himself, and that lately he had sensed more crime in his neighborhood.
As he left a laundromat with a bag of clothes over his shoulder, he shook his head at the Times front page that illustrated the steep climb of Rizzo's salary to $787,637 over more than a decade.
"If you're making that much money," Andrade said, "it should be a better city."

Full text: New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said Thursday he agreed to host a gathering of leaders from the United States and Mexico after their yearly border conference was canceled by the Arizona governor amid threats of a boycott by Mexican politicians.
But the governors of Texas and Arizona said they wouldn't attend -- another sign of growing discord over immigration policies on both sides of the border.
"Obviously, all border governors are welcome and encouraged to attend, although the governors of Arizona and Texas have said they are not interested in joining a dialogue with their border colleagues," Gilbert Gallegos, a spokesman for Mr. Richardson, said Thursday.
The Border Governors Conference, which has been held 27 times, was scheduled to take place in Phoenix in September. But after Arizona passed its hotly debated illegal immigration law this year, the Mexican delegation refused to set foot in the state. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican up for reelection, cancelled the event.
Beyond immigration, elected officials along the international border have a crowded list of issues that range from commercial trucks stuck at checkpoints to cattle pests that too easily gain entry.
Although states in both countries defer to their federal governments in most cross-border issues, the conference has been a forum to exchange information, participants say.
For months, delegates from the border states' economic development departments and environmental agencies, police forces and tourism offices, have been sitting at 13 "work tables" to come up with ways to cooperate on a variety of fronts.
The Arizona law, which requires police to inquire on the legal status of people they stop for other alleged crimes, was not on their agenda.
The law has been widely criticized in Mexico. On the U.S. side of the border, all four governorships are up for grabs in November, and the ongoing immigration debate is galvanizing Democrat and GOP voters alike.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, who is vacating office, said that he would attend the gathering no matter where it was held. Ms. Brewer and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another Republican up for reelection, have said that they would not.
At delegate work tables, where staffers and others perform much of the actual substantive work on cross-border problems for the conference, some participants lament that politics is getting in the way of their task. Still, they are ready to deliver their recommendations regardless of who shows up.
"If we don't work together we are totally failing," said Francisco Marmolejo, a professor at the University of Arizona who co-chairs the science and technology committee.

Full text: If President Obama is serious about a comprehensive immigration reform, he'll need to overcome two big problems: our softening competitive edge in the global market, and the hostile attitudes many Americans have about immigration. The way out? Establish a strong rationale for immigration that's linked to our self-interest in innovation and long-term economic development.
In the years leading up to World War II, the United States recruited Europe's top talent for our nuclear program. Scientists such as Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and Edward Teller immigrated to America and played an instrumental role in securing our country's future and developing its nuclear advantage.
Today, we need to think about a new "Einstein Principle" for our immigration policy. It would make brains, talent and special skills a priority. The point is to attract more individuals with the potential to enhance American innovation and competitiveness, increasing the odds for economic prosperity and rising living standards for all down the road.
At a time of high unemployment, the most pressing need is for more innovators who will start new businesses and create high-paying jobs. We've certainly done so successfully in the past.
A Duke University study by Vivek Wadhwa found that 25% of all the technology and engineering businesses launched in the U.S. between 1995 and 2005 had a foreign-born founder. In Silicon Valley, that number was 52.4%. Much of the high-tech boom of recent years has rested on immigrant entrepreneurship.
Yet only 15% of our annual visas are now set aside for employment purposes. Of these, some go to seasonal agricultural workers, while a small number of H-1B visas (65,000) are reserved for "specialty occupations" such as scientists, engineers, and technological experts.
The number reserved for scientists and engineers is drastically below the figure allowed between 1999 and 2004. In that interval, the U.S. federal government set aside up to 195,000 visas each year for H-1B entry. The idea was that scientific innovators were so important for long-term economic development that we needed to boost the number let in.
Meanwhile, other countries have taken the lead. Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, for example, are more strategic in viewing immigration as a way to attract foreign talent. Canada, for instance, explicitly targets foreign workers in short supply who can contribute to their economy. It admits around 265,000 immigrants each year. Of these, 154,000 visas (58%) are set aside for economic purposes, such as skilled workers or live-in caregivers, while 71,000 (26%) are devoted to family reunification.
Canada's percentages are nearly the reverse of national policy in the U.S. Here, nearly two-thirds of visas (64%) are devoted to family reunification, whereby foreigners who have come to America and become citizens can sponsor spouses, parents, children, brothers and sisters for citizenship. Unlike other countries whose leaders understand the value of skilled and seasonal labor for long-term economic development, we continue to place a very low priority on admitting immigrants with economic talents.
One of the virtues of the Canadian approach is that immigration is far less controversial among its general public -- because people see how newcomers strengthen the national economy. With benefits widely understood, immigration is perceived as being very favorable for the country as a whole. In the U.S., the Gallup Organization has found that 52% of Americans say they want to decrease immigration; while in Canada, only 27% feel that way. Canadians embrace immigration because they understand how new arrivals benefit their country.
Unfortunately, the U.S. has put itself in an impossible position from the standpoint of public opinion. It admits a large number of legal immigrants who may or may not add to our prosperity and has lots of illegal ones on top of that. Instead of viewing immigration as a brain gain, ordinary folks see the economic and social costs as broad, and the benefits as narrow.
If we expect more Americans to support immigration, it must be obvious to them what the national benefits are. The problem with today's policies is that they focus public and media attention much more on immigrant costs than benefits. That explains why no one likes the status quo, but comprehensive reform is so difficult to enact.

The company continued to expect that a coming relief well will be the permanent solution. BP will reopen valves by Saturday to let the oil flow resume and will conduct seismic tests to determine if oil leaked from other parts of the well while the cap was in place.
A Senate panel plans to call BP, which has interests in Libya, to a hearing on Scotland's decision to free the Lockerbie bomber.

Abstract: Flushing already has hundreds of local stores and its position as a transportation hub -- the No. 7 subway, city buses and the Long Island Railroad all meet in the heart of downtown Flushing -- means that more than 100,000 people pass through daily, including residents of downtown Flushing and commuters who work and shop in the area.

Full text: If Queens were a separate city, it would be neck and neck with Houston as the fourth largest in the U.S., with a population of 2.3 million. Yet the borough has had only one regional shopping mall -- until now.
In the business district of Flushing, one of the densest areas in New York City, Sky View Center, an 800,000-square-foot shopping mall, has started to open its doors.
Flushing already has hundreds of local stores and its position as a transportation hub -- the No. 7 subway, city buses and the Long Island Railroad all meet in the heart of downtown Flushing -- means that more than 100,000 people pass through daily, including residents of downtown Flushing and commuters who work and shop in the area.
Even though the new mall will increase congestion in an area already packed with pedestrians and cars, there are residents are looking forward to having more national retailers locally. The only regional mall in Queens currently is Queens Center in Elmhurst.
"People are happy to have them because we [often] have to go to Long Island, Manhattan or New Jersey to buy something," said Fred Fu, president of Flushing Development Center, a nonprofit that hosts cultural events in Flushing.
Though it is too early to tell whether the area's many small, mostly Asian, businesses will be affected, Mr. Fu suggests that the new mall will benefit existing business owners.
"The new stores will generate more customers for the small businesses. People from Long Island City, Jamaica, and Bayside will come here to buy," he says.
Sky View Center is already 75% leased with three big box stores -- BJ's Wholesale Club, Best Buy and Bob's Discount Furniture Store -- already open. Target is expected to open in October. Also in the fall, Marshall's, Old Navy and Bed Bath & Beyond will open their doors.
Once the development is completed in 2011, additional tenants will include Famous Footwear, Five Guys Burger and Fries, numerous restaurants and a Sky Foods Supermarket -- an Asian family-owned chain.
"There is no shortage of patrons to Flushing, but it is dramatically underserved from a retail and residential perspective," said Michael Dana, president of Onex Real Estate Partners and developer of the project. Forest Hills-based Muss Development LLC is co-owner of the project.
The shopping mall is just one part of the mixed-used development, Sky View Parc, which will eventually be home to more than 1,000 families with three of six planned housing towers to be completed this year. Units from studios to three-bedroom condominiums will be priced from $385,000 to more than $1 million.
The project is attracting a mix of local single and family buyers looking for more lifestyle amenities and service, as well as empty nesters and first-time home buyers.
Big-name retailers could be found in Flushing until the late 1980s. Some started to depart after Asian immigrants -- who didn't shop at the stores enough because there weren't many products that catered to them -- moved into the area. "Now is the time for the big businesses to come back because the economy [in Flushing] is booming," said Mr. Fu.
Two national chains have been in the district on Roosevelt Avenue for years, A Macy's store is approximately 50 years old and Old Navy has been there for nearly 10 years.
"They have shown these types of business can succeed in a community that is a certain type of ethnicity," said Ricardi Calixte, director of neighborhood economic development at the Queens Economic Development Corp. "It's a sign of what's to come."

Full text: In the first courtroom showdown over Arizona's new immigration law, an attorney for a Phoenix police officer asked a federal judge Thursday to halt the implementation of much of the statute, saying it undermined the ability of the federal government to set foreign policy.
"We have only one nation; we can only have one immigration law," attorney Stephen Montoya argued in a courtroom packed with more than 100 spectators.
"Even though the state of Arizona believes Congress is not very competent and is inept, the state of Arizona has to live with the laws of Congress."
The law, set to take effect July 29 unless U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton stops it, requires police to investigate the immigration status of people they lawfully stop and have reason to believe are in the country illegally. It also makes it a crime in Arizona to lack immigration documents.
Bolton took the matter under advisement after a two-hour hearing and gave no indication when she would issue a decision. She is scheduled to hear similar arguments July 22 in lawsuits filed by civil rights groups and the Obama administration.
Outside the courthouse, small groups of supporters and opponents of the law waved signs and American flags.
"Adios Illegals," read one backer's T-shirt. Inside, both attorneys' arguments veered smoothly from the legal to the political.
John Bouma, a lawyer for Gov. Jan Brewer, said the state wanted only to help the federal government do what it has so far been unable to do: secure the border.
"There's no reason Arizona should stand by and suffer the consequences of a broken system when Arizona has 15,000 well-trained law enforcement officers who can help the federal government fix it," he said.
Federal courts have held that states cannot create their own immigration policies. But Bouma contended that the Arizona law, known as SB 1070, required police to assist the federal government only by making various federal immigration crimes state offenses as well.
"The decision was made to make assisting the federal government in enforcing immigration laws a state policy rather than just a local option," Bouma said.
Montoya scoffed at that suggestion, saying the best response to Arizona's argument "is to laugh." He noted that the Obama administration argued that the Arizona law would hinder the government in enforcing federal immigration regulations.
In a preview of arguments he is expected to make at next week's hearing, Bouma suggested that the federal government was not properly enforcing existing laws. "They want to say, 'Hey, we're not doing anything, but we've preempted the field, so you can't,' " he said.
The Arizona law runs 20 pages and contains 14 provisions, some so complicated or vaguely written that even the governor's lawyer wasn't sure of their meaning.
Montoya said his client, Officer David Salgado, mainly wants to invalidate the parts that involve local law enforcement's obligations to investigate illegal immigrants.
Officers nationwide are allowed to ask people if they are in the country legally and arrest them if they are not. But SB 1070 requires Arizona officers to do so when they stop people for violations of any laws or ordinances and suspect they are in the country illegally.
Montoya said the law means that if an officer saw him spitting on the sidewalk or parking his car at an expired meter and believed he was an illegal immigrant, the officer would be required to investigate.
Bolton noted another provision, which requires that anyone arrested in Arizona -- for any offense -- be held until the federal government verifies that the suspect is in the country legally.
She asked Bouma whether that meant that someone arrested for a nonviolent misdemeanor, such as driving 20 mph over the speed limit, could be held for a long time during a status check.
Bouma said he didn't believe so but, referring to the language in the law, acknowledged, "I don't know if it's the most artful way of writing that." He told the judge that another part of the law, which says it must be applied constitutionally, would prevent people from being held too long.

U.S. News: Officer Sues Over Arizona Immigrant Law --- Lawyer for Phoenix Policeman Says His Client Can Face Litigation for Enforcing Contentious Statute and Failing to Enforce It

Full text: PHOENIX -- A lawyer for a Phoenix police officer told a federal court Thursday his client could be sued for racial profiling if he enforces Arizona's new immigration law.
It is the first hearing in a series of legal challenges filed over the controversial crackdown that has divided law enforcement in the state and across the country.
Officer David Salgado, a 19-year veteran of the Phoenix police department, could also lose his job if he fails to enforce the new law, his attorney said.
Arizona's statute requires an officer to verify the immigration status of a person stopped for other alleged crimes, if "reasonable suspicion" exists of illegal presence in the U.S.
But the law also empowers Arizona residents to sue an officer they believe isn't enforcing the law to the fullest extent.
"If he enforces the law, he can be sued," said Stephen Montoya, the attorney for Mr. Salgado. "If he doesn't enforce the law, he can be sued" by a private citizen. His client "is caught between a rock and a hard place," he said.
Mr. Montoya also argued that the law, which makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally, usurps federal authority over immigration. "The state of Arizona cannot order its employees to violate federal law," he said.
Attorneys for Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer told the judge that the lawsuit, which was also filed by an advocacy group called Chicanos Por La Causa, should be dismissed because the police officer and the group have no valid claim of immediate harm and the state law doesn't trump federal immigration law.
Outside the courthouse, in 105-degree heat, about 50 protesters and supporters of the law gathered; police kept the two sides apart.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton did not rule on whether to dismiss the challenge or block the law from being enforced.
Unless an injunction is issued by a federal judge, the law will go into effect on July 29.
Hearings on at least two of the six other lawsuits, including one filed by the Obama administration, are scheduled for next week. One of the six suits was filed by another police officer, Martin Escobar.
Mr. Escobar, who patrols a heavily Hispanic enclave in Tucson, the state's second-largest city, claims in the lawsuit that he would lose the cooperation of Latino witnesses, which he said was a key to solving crimes.
Separately, two Arizona county sheriffs announced the establishment of a legal fund to raise money to defend themselves and their deputies against lawsuits.
In May, police chiefs from Phoenix, Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia and other large cities met with Attorney General Eric Holder to voice concern that the law will drive a wedge between police and immigrant communities, drain resources and undermine public safety. Legislators in several states have begun to draft laws similar to that of Arizona.
But some police officers and sheriffs in Arizona, the country's busiest corridor for human and narcotic smuggling, say the law gives them an additional tool to tackle illegal immigration.
Law-enforcement officers, who can decide when to arrest or shoot someone, should also be trusted to enforce the new law without profiling based on race, said Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, whose jurisdiction covers a vast area between the Mexican border and Phoenix.
"I believe in my deputies' professionalism," he said.
Only 11 Pinal County deputies are currently cross-trained under a federal program that empowers some local law enforcement to help identify illegal immigrants.
"Now, all 214 of my deputies will have the authority" to round up those suspected of being here illegally, Mr. Babeu said.
The offices of Sheriff Babeu and nearby Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever are named in a lawsuit recently filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. On Thursday, they announced they had started a legal fund, with the support of a non-profit group, Legacy Foundation, to help defend them against lawsuits.
"People will be lining up to sue us for racial profiling," Mr. Dever said. "It's an insult to the rank-and-file deputies who know how to operate within the parameters expected of them."
Ms. Brewer has also hired a private attorney to represent her in the lawsuits. Ms. Brewer has said racial profiling won't be tolerated. After signing the bill April 23, she ordered the state's police training and licensing board to develop a program that sets standards for enforcement to prevent profiling.

Abstract: Co-produced by Company of Angels Theatre and the Thai Community Development Center, a hard-hitting staging by Marlene Forte commemorates the 15th anniversary of the case and seeks to raise awareness about a continuing crisis. The show's second half becomes more of a police procedural, tracing the efforts of law enforcement and civilian personnel who defy systemic racism and corruption to bring the first slavery prosecution since abolition.

Full text: Think slavery in the U.S. ended with the Civil War? Playwright Henry Ong urges you to reconsider.
"Fabric," Ong's new drama, undermines complacency with the unsettling events surrounding a 1995 raid on a sweatshop in an El Monte apartment complex. A multi-agency task force freed 72 undocumented Thai garment workers held in captivity there -- some for up to seven years. Co-produced by Company of Angels Theatre and the Thai Community Development Center, a hard-hitting staging by Marlene Forte commemorates the 15th anniversary of the case and seeks to raise awareness about a continuing crisis.
The show's priorities and principal strengths are primarily socio-political, and its message can be ponderous at times. Still, Ong's extensively researched storytelling is often moving and always compelling in its specificity. In the more intimate and dramatically rigorous first act, a trio of naive, uneducated rural peasants in Thailand are lured into indentured servitude with promises of wealth and opportunity. Transported to America under false passports, they're delivered into the clutches of merciless clothing wholesaler Auntie Suni (played with oily malevolence by standout Dian Kobayashi).
The show's second half becomes more of a police procedural, tracing the efforts of law enforcement and civilian personnel who defy systemic racism and corruption to bring the first slavery prosecution since abolition. Characters and plot threads abound, but in trying to cover so many aspects of the case some focus and momentum are sacrificed.
The story still resonates, particularly with respect to the worldwide blight of human trafficking and the immigration debate in this country. (The moral quandary over what to do with the "liberated" undocumented factory slaves -- asylum or deportation? -- figures prominently). A pointed closing challenge asks the audience to consider the source of the clothes we're wearing as we watch.

Family meal with a side of angst
At the end of "Four Places," now extended at Theatre/Theater, the woman next to me murmured it was like watching George and Martha's kids take their mom out to eat. If you enjoy "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," you'll want to lunch with the family in Joel Drake Johnson's dark comedy.
Recently widowed Ellen (Roxanne Hart) takes mom Peggy (Anne Gee Byrd) to dine at her favorite restaurant every week, but today Ellen's brother, Warren (Tim Bagley), has joined them. Peggy smells an ambush. As small talk gives way to strained silence, Johnson expertly calibrates the lunch's shift from banalities to a showdown. Gradually we learn how Peggy and her husband have been living, and why. Their wounds are ancient, but they're being reopened. The children struggle to wrap their minds around this fresh hell: Is Peggy abusing her husband -- or is it the other way around? Or is their dance, a la Albee, some strange rite of love?
Director Robin Larsen and her fine cast are happy to put us through the ringer in this Rogue Machine Theatre production. Byrd is masterful as a cagey alcoholic, and Hart's perpetual physical tension -- Ellen could really use a neck massage -- speaks as powerfully as any dialogue. Even Lisa Rothschiller, playing a waitress with an unexpected relation to the family, lands her character's eerie mix of cheer and aggression.
Mark Guirguis' set features a revolving unit with a car interior on one end and a corner restaurant table on the other. The design emphasizes the visual challenge here: The actors sit during most of the play, and there's a claustrophobic quality to the action that, while logical, feels theatrically limiting. There's a way in which the play never turns inside out -- the action brings no deep change -- that keeps it from being completely satisfying. But isn't that a lot like a family meal? Bon appetit.

Romance, wit go on a ride-along
Felicitous wit and existential ache drive "Becky's New Car" in its Southern California premiere. Steven Dietz's comedy of manners speeds by on plucky charm, as director Michael Rothhaar's well-oiled Pacific Resident Theatre mounting demonstrates.
Commissioned in 2008 by A Contemporary Theatre in Seattle, "New Car" follows perky Becky Foster (the wonderful Joanna Daniels). This working mom ignores the fourth wall, inviting us in to the split-focus living room/auto dealership office of designer William Wilday's effective set.
Joe (stalwart Jon Eric Preston), Becky's husband, accepted ennui years ago. Chris (Nick Rogers), their self-entitled psychology major son, won't leave home. Steve (a riotous Christopher Shaw), Becky's coworker, welds widower's malaise to enervated ambition. No wonder Becky prefers driving. Working late one night, Becky meets millionaire widower Walter Flood (the terrific Brad Greenquist). He mistakenly infers that Becky is a widow -- and she doesn't correct him. Her subsequent forays into Walter's milieu steer this hybrid screwball-romantic vehicle, picking up Walter's daughter, Kenni (Jules Willcox), and strapped heiress Ginger (ever-acerbic Suzanne Ford).
The sleek dialogue and pert theatricality are vintage Dietz. Daniels, the play's internal combustion engine, is delightful, whether changing her Audrey Eisner-designed costumes onstage with audience aid or offering us a Sprite. Her colleagues are uniformly solid, as are the designers, Wilday's lighting and Keith Stevenson's sound adroitly negotiating the hairpin turns.
Such expertise almost conceals how Dietz must drop the magic realism of Act 1 and conventionally bend his ethos to resolve things (though the finale is Preston's finest hour). Still, "Becky's New Car" may lack rear-end alignment, but it's a smoothly enjoyable ride, regardless.

Sentiment drags heart-felt 'Grace'
Director Cameron Watson has a rocky mountain row to hoe in "Grace & Glorie," Tom Ziegler's mushily sentimental two-hander at the Colony.
The show provides a prime opportunity to see Beth Grant, a prolific stage, screen and television actor ("No Country for Old Men," "The Trials and Tribulations of a Trailer Trash Housewife") in rare form. Otherwise, we get the uneasy feeling that we've seen this play done before, and better.
Grant plays "amazing" Grace, an illiterate, terminally ill 90-year-old mountain woman who has returned to her remote mountain cabin -- spectacularly realized in Jeff McLaughlin's authentically rustic set -- to die. Gloria (Melinda Page Hamilton), dubbed "Glorie" by Grace, is the Harvard-educated hospice volunteer assigned to Grace's case. As it turns out, Glorie bears the crushing weight of recent tragedy. But she derives new hope from her wise old friend, whose homespun wisdom, born of her own personal hardships, proves life-affirming.
If that makes your teeth ache a bit, Watson's staging may ease the pain. A proven pro with sound instincts, Watson understands Southern dialect and material, as evidenced by his sensitive staging of Horton Foote's "The Habitation of Dragons" a few seasons back. When it comes to regional coloration, Watson knows that less is more. That fact is lost on Ziegler, whose blatantly derivative play seems overblown and oddly condescending. A natural-born performer with unerring instincts, Grant plays Grace close to the bone and very funny. As for Hamilton, she's wispy where she should be city-brittle, yet she stands her ground next to Grant -- and that's saying quite a bit.

Full text: New Mexico will host a meeting of U.S. and Mexican border governors, providing a new venue for a conference that was scrapped in Arizona because of a dispute over its new immigration enforcement law.
The governors of Arizona and Texas will not attend the rescheduled meeting.
The meeting will be held in Santa Fe in late September, according to Gilbert Gallegos, a spokesman for Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson.
The governors of six Mexican states are expected to attend, Gallegos said.
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, called off the meeting in Phoenix after the Mexican governors planned to boycott it because of her state's immigration law that requires police to check that people they stop are in the country legally.

List sends a chill through Utah; A letter claiming to identify 1,300 illegal immigrants alarms many Latinos.

Full text: Since the distribution of an anonymous letter this week containing the names, addresses and other personal data of more than 1,300 Utah residents said to be undocumented immigrants, Tony Yapias' phone has not stopped ringing.
"I have one phone line; I've already missed 60 calls now, and there are 72 messages," said Yapias, a radio host and director of the advocacy group Proyecto Latino de Utah. "People wanting to know if they're on the list. Should they move to another state? Should they leave the country? Horrified, scared, whatever language you can put on it."
The office of Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, announced Thursday that an investigation into the list was focusing on the possibility of an unauthorized release of information from the state Department of Workforce Services, which collects information on unemployment benefits, food stamps, Medicaid and other government programs.
"It appears that all the data on that list are contained within that agency's database, and they have found some evidence of inappropriate access, so they're drilling down on that as we speak," Angie Welling, the governor's communications director, said in a telephone interview.
A team of 10 state information technology specialists is examining who gained access to or printed out data that might have ended up on the list, which includes birth dates, addresses and in some cases Social Security numbers.
That information will be handed over to the state attorney general's office to determine whether a crime was committed, Welling said.
"These people [who distributed the list] are very interested in making sure that we disclose the names of people they think are breaking the law. I think it's only fair that they disclose who they are, and tell us why they didn't break the law," said Paul Murphy, spokesman for the Utah attorney general's office.
Intentionally disclosing a private record or gaining access to such a record under false pretenses could be prosecuted as a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail, Murphy said.
"It could be as much as a third-degree felony, meaning up to five years in prison, if the custodian of the records actually stole the records," he added.
Federal authorities also are examining the list because, in some cases, it contained Social Security numbers, said Jonathan Lasher, assistant inspector general for external relations for the federal Social Security Administration.
The mysterious list, accompanied by an unsigned letter demanding that those whose names appear on the list be immediately deported, appeared as some residents are pushing Utah to join Arizona in stepping up state enforcement actions against undocumented immigrants.
A bill similar to Arizona's new immigration law is expected to be introduced in Utah's Legislature next year.
The list, originally given to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Salt Lake City in April, was redistributed this week with additional names to legislators, police chiefs and Utah news organizations, accompanied by another demand that public officials take action.
"We ask that you remember who you work for in this country -- you work for America and for the citizens in the state of Utah. You DO NOT work for illegal immigrants who have come into our country illegally and who now take advantage of our system," it said. "They need to go -- and go now."
Yapias said some of those whose names appear on the list have been confirmed as legal residents. He said there are fears the list could reach extremists who might use it to intimidate or harass those on the list.
"Politically, we can agree to disagree," Yapias said. "We can say both sides of the issue have been going at it passionately at every level. But to begin a new level of terrorizing families, that's not right. I mean, it's un-American -- whatever word you want to find for it, it's just wrong."
Most of Utah's major immigration activist groups have denied any role in distributing the list. Some have condemned it.
"Our position is it was inappropriate to compile or release the list," said Ron Mortenson, co-founder of the Utah Coalition on Illegal Immigration, which has advocated for legislation to crack down on identity theft for the purposes of obtaining false immigration documents.
"We see it as a rule-of-law issue," he said. "The fact is we expect everyone to comply with the law, illegal aliens and American citizens.... If it's a political issue, you address it through the legislative process, not through some extralegal method."

Abstract: In some editions, a July 16 A-section article about Argentina's Congress voting to legalize same-sex marriage misspelled the first name of a man celebrating the vote. The vote -- which also made Argentina the second country in the Americas, after Canada, to approve marriage for gay men and lesbians -- prompted thousands of supporters to whoop in the streets and shout, "We made history!" Among them was Marquez, who recounted a long fight for what he called equal rights.

Full text: Correction: In some editions, a July 16 A-section article about Argentina's Congress voting to legalize same-sex marriage misspelled the first name of a man celebrating the vote. He is Marcelo Marquez, not Marcel Marquez. (Published 7/21/2010)
It was 4:05 a.m. and frigid outside the Congress building in Buenos Aires as Argentine lawmakers voted Thursday to legalize same-sex marriage, but Marcelo Marquez was still there. He had waited through 14 hours of debate for the moment that would make his country the first in overwhelmingly Catholic Latin America to grant gay couples the same rights as heterosexual ones.
"For me, it was incredible," said Marquez, 41, a philosophy teacher who now plans to marry his partner, Mariano Tissone, 37. "Everyone exploded -- screaming, dancing, hugging, some singing the national anthem."
The Senate voted 33 to 27 in favor of the bill, which the lower house had approved in May with strong backing from President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. The vote -- which also made Argentina the second country in the Americas, after Canada, to approve marriage for gay men and lesbians -- prompted thousands of supporters to whoop in the streets and shout, "We made history!"
Among them was Marquez, who recounted a long fight for what he called equal rights. "We now have legal recognition, given by the state," he said. "We are so happy that the state did not stop our fight for equality."
Gay rights activists in the region and beyond said Argentina's action would serve as an example. Already, advocates of gay marriage in Chile and Paraguay have said they hope their lawmakers will be spurred to approve similar proposals.
Dan Hawes of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington said the vote in Argentina also gives momentum to gay rights advocates in the United States.
"The victory in Argentina shows those of us in the U.S. who are working for the freedom to marry that with persistence, engaging the public, in making the case why same-sex couples need and deserve the right to marry, that we can continue to advance the freedom to marry," he said by phone Thursday afternoon. "Even in places where the odds are stacked against us."
In Argentina, the Catholic Church had mounted a vigorous campaign to stop the bill. Posters plastered on walls featured a man and a woman cuddling a baby and the admonition, "Kids have a right to a dad and mom." As the debate in the country's ornate, 104-year-old Congress began Wednesday, tens of thousands of people opposed to the legislation prayed and rallied outside.
They were led by Argentina's highest cleric, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who had warned that approving the bill amounted to an "intention to destroy God's plan."
But what observers had predicted would be a tight vote in the upper house turned out to be not so close.
Sen. Gerardo Morales told other lawmakers that the bill would remedy "a situation of injustice and discrimination toward sectors of the Argentine society who really do not have the guarantee of equal rights as our constitution establishes."
Fernandez de Kirchner, speaking from China where she was on a state visit, said she was "very satisfied with the vote."
"To think that 50 years ago women could not vote and that not long ago there was no interracial marriage in the United States," she said in comments carried by La Nacion, a Buenos Aires newspaper. "All that has changed. We can think this has been a positive step in defending minority rights."
In Latin America, which is uniformly Catholic and where the church hierarchy is often consulted on major decisions, only Mexico's capital city has approved same-sex marriages. But gay activists have made progress: Colombia's highest court last year gave same-sex partners nearly all the rights found in common-law unions. Uruguay's Congress also recognized same-sex civil unions.
"In some northern countries, they said these advances could never happen in our region," said Marcela Sanchez of Colombia Diversa, an advocacy group on gay issues in the Colombian capital, Bogota. "But now we are seeing movement forward in a number of places."
For American gay rights advocates, the vote in Argentina puts that country of 41 million people ahead of the United States, where voters in California and other states have approved propositions blocking gay unions. Only the District and five states, four of them in New England, have legalized gay marriage.
In some ways, Argentina seemed a logical choice for the approval of gay marriage.
Though influential, the Catholic Church is not omnipresent in the country, which has long been a magnet for immigrants from around the world, including Jews, Muslims and, a century ago, anarchists who rejected the Vatican.
The Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, is also among the world's most cosmopolitan cities, with numerous bars and hotels catering to gays. The city legalized same-sex unions in 2002, though gays have faced legal obstacles to getting married and only a handful had taken vows.
Nearly 70 percent of Argentines thought it was time to legalize gay marriage, according to a recent poll by the Analogias polling firm. Analia del Franco, the firm's general director, said the country's strong human rights tradition, a product of the fight against a military dictatorship that lasted from 1976 to 1983, had helped propel the gay marriage bill.
"This is something that comes from way back," del Franco said.

Full text: In the political marketplace, there's now a run on Obama shares. The left is disappointed with the president. Independents are abandoning him in droves. And the right is already dancing on his political grave, salivating about November when, his own press secretary admitted Sunday, Democrats might lose the House.
I have a warning for Republicans: Don't underestimate Barack Obama.
Consider what he has already achieved. Obamacare alone makes his presidency historic. It has irrevocably changed one-sixth of the economy, put the country inexorably on the road to national health care and, as acknowledged by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus but few others, begun one of the most massive wealth redistributions in U.S. history.
Second, there is major financial reform, which passed Congress on Thursday. Economists argue whether it will prevent meltdowns and bailouts as promised. But there is no argument that it will give the government unprecedented power in the financial marketplace. Its 2,300 pages will create at least 243 new regulations that will affect not only, as many assume, the big banks but just about everyone, including, as noted in one summary (the Wall Street Journal), "storefront check cashiers, city governments, small manufacturers, home buyers and credit bureaus."
Third is the near $1 trillion stimulus, the largest spending bill in U.S. history. And that's not even counting nationalizing the student loan program, regulating carbon emissions by Environmental Protection Agency fiat, and still-fitful attempts to pass cap-and-trade through Congress.
But Obama's most far-reaching accomplishment is his structural alteration of the U.S. budget. The stimulus, the vast expansion of domestic spending, the creation of ruinous deficits as far as the eye can see are not easily reversed.
These are not mere temporary countercyclical measures. They are structural deficits because, as everyone from Obama on down admits, the real money is in entitlements, most specifically Medicare and Medicaid. But Obamacare freezes these out as a source of debt reduction. Obamacare's $500 billion in Medicare cuts and $600 billion in tax increases are siphoned away for a new entitlement -- and no longer available for deficit reduction.
The result? There just isn't enough to cut elsewhere to prevent national insolvency. That will require massive tax increases -- most likely a European-style value-added tax. Just as President Ronald Reagan cut taxes to starve the federal government and prevent massive growth in spending, Obama's wild spending -- and quarantining health-care costs from providing possible relief -- will necessitate huge tax increases.
The net effect of 18 months of Obamaism will be to undo much of Reaganism. Both presidencies were highly ideological, grandly ambitious and often underappreciated by their own side. In his early years, Reagan was bitterly attacked from his right. (Typical Washington Post headline: "For Reagan and the New Right, the Honeymoon Is Over" -- and that was six months into his presidency!) Obama is attacked from his left for insufficient zeal on gay rights, immigration reform, closing Guantanamo -- the list is long. The critics don't understand the big picture. Obama's transformational agenda is a play in two acts.
Act One is over. The stimulus, Obamacare, financial reform have exhausted his first-term mandate. It will bear no more heavy lifting. And the Democrats will pay the price for ideological overreaching by losing one or both houses, whether de facto or de jure. The rest of the first term will be spent consolidating these gains (writing the regulations, for example) and preparing for Act Two.
The next burst of ideological energy -- massive regulation of the energy economy, federalizing higher education and "comprehensive" immigration reform (i.e., amnesty) -- will require a second mandate, meaning reelection in 2012.
That's why there's so much tension between Obama and congressional Democrats. For Obama, 2010 matters little. If Democrats lose control of one or both houses, Obama will probably have an easier time in 2012, just as Bill Clinton used Newt Gingrich and the Republicans as the foil for his 1996 reelection campaign.
Obama is down, but it's very early in the play. Like Reagan, he came here to do things. And he's done much in his first 500 days. What he has left to do he knows must await his next 500 days -- those that come after reelection.
The real prize is 2012. Obama sees far, farther than even his own partisans. Republicans underestimate him at their peril.

Full text: The world's sport
It seemed like more people in the U.S. followed the World Cup this year than in previous years, and the media covered it like it was the biggest event of the summer. Don't ask me why, though, because I can't understand any of the appeal of soccer.
Fundamentally, the game seems similar to hockey, in that the object is to score goals. Only instead of hitting a puck with sticks, soccer players kick around a ball. And soccer lacks all the speed, hitting and fighting that make hockey so exciting. And while hockey can be a low-scoring game, soccer players score even less, despite the fact that the net is many times bigger.
Then there are soccer players who flail around like they have a serious injury every time they are barely even touched. Please. Professional wrestling looks more real. Come to think of it, pro wrestling also involves more athleticism and is certainly more entertaining to watch.
The rest of the world can have the World Cup. I think I speak for all Chicago sports fans when I say we're happier with the Stanley Cup.
-- Bill Koester, Schererville, Ind.
Lack of mobility
I'm a homeowner in Illinois. I was lucky enough to survive the recession so far with a job and the home I purchased in 2006. However, the value of my home has dropped at least 20 percent. It's probably still worth (a little) more than I owe on the mortgage. But with no equity in my house, I'm stuck; without that equity for a down payment, I can't sell my home and relocate if a better opportunity arises or family ties take me elsewhere.
I know many people in the country face the same issue, probably many more than are in danger of losing their homes due to loss of income. This lack of mobility is dragging down both the labor and housing markets. People can't relocate to find work and they can't buy new homes even if they manage to sell their current ones. A significant number of families might be defaulting on their mortgages simply to move on.
A potential solution presented itself while rolling over a 401(k) from a previous employer: I could use some of those funds for the down payment on my next home. However, as I've already purchased my first home, the tax code prevents me from doing so without suffering a dramatic penalty.
I propose modifying the tax code, either permanently or temporarily, to allow existing homeowners to use personal retirement funds for down payments to purchase new primary residences.
I think this added flexibility would boost both the labor and housing markets, and thus the economy. I can foresee several concerns with encouraging people to dip into their nest eggs, especially given the current state of Social Security and most pension funds. However, with the current market for securities and other retirement vehicles, I feel housing, in its depressed state, is at least as good an investment.
In such dire times, shouldn't the people be free to pick their poison? Let the power of the market drive the recovery!
-- Dan Terhune, Ingleside
Team leaders
Recently two talk-radio hosts locked in a fierce debate over whether LeBron James would depose Michael Jordan as the greatest basketball player ever. Call-ins were plentiful and passionate about their choices. The issue ultimately turned on which player is a better athlete.
James got the nod.
Yet an undeniable reality is Jordan leads him six championships to none, which raises the notion of how much weight leadership and attitude carry in determining winners.
Had James chosen Chicago, leadership would have fallen to him, a role he arguably failed at in Cleveland and opted out of in Miami. While it would have been exciting to watch him in a Bulls uniform, he may have produced no legacy as cherished as Jordan's.
So ideally when our new leader finally emerges, we'll have few regrets about James' fabled decision.
-- Richard Harris, Chicago
Terror on the highways
While frequently driving from Morton Grove to Naperville on Interstate Highways 294 and 88, I am always struck by the number of drivers who have chosen to take my life and that of others in their hands.
Never have I traveled these highways when I have not observed drivers speeding, cutting across multiple traffic lanes and tailgating terrified drivers.
In the "most bizarre" category was a middle-age man on a motorcycle doing about 80 miles an hour, during rush hour, in the express lane, without a helmet (which dangled from the back of his seat).
Have these drivers no fear or respect for human life?
There was a time when state police patrolled our highways and ticketed speeders, which served as a deterrent to these maniacs.
Sadly we rarely see any law-enforcement officials on the highways any more and news reports of cutbacks have given the road crazies full rein to terrify others without fear of punishment.
Add to this serious dilemma the fact that judges are far too lenient with speeders and drunk drivers and repeat offenders.
In addition to the drunks and repeat offenders who have been let loose on our highways, we also have people on drugs and others talking on cell phones and texting -- or both.
In a 55-mile-per-hour zone, I drive 60 miles an hour in order to barely keep pace with the flow of traffic. Most other cars are exceeding my speed by at least 10 miles per hour while I grip my steering wheel white-knuckled and pray that one of these maniacs who is tailgating me won't run into me and paralyze me for life or cripple me. Is it not time for our judges to take these drivers off the road?
-- Mel Novit, Morton Grove
Fine law breakers
I have almost been run into by cyclists during Taste of Chicago and during my weekly outings in the Loop. Am I under a misunderstanding that sidewalks are for pedestrians? If illegal bike-riders were ticketed, as well as non-picking-up-dog-poop dog owners and all the many drivers in Chicago yakking on cell phones, it would do a bit to close the budget gap.
-- Candace Drimmer, Chicago
Immigration reform
Arizona knows what's happening: All of Mexico is watching for the outcome of our government's immigration-reform agenda. If it goes our government's way, the flood gates will burst with immigrants and Arizona will get it first and worst!
-- Mel Dormer, Aurora

Full text: Author: Nicholas Casey
CIUDAD JUÃREZ, Mexico--Two Americans were driving back to El Paso, Texas, last December after an afternoon across the border in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez. A few blocks from the border, they were surrounded by Mexican army trucks and pulled from their Dodge Ram.
Mexico's military says it found two suitcases full of marijuana in the cab of the pickup truck. Two soldiers later testified that they drove the two Americans to a military compound on the outskirts of town, questioned them briefly, then turned them over to civilian authorities. The Americans were charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell.
Those two men--Shohn Huckabee, 23 years old, and Carlos Quijas, 36--are being held in a Ciudad JuÃ¡rez jail. They tell a different story about what happened that night. They say Mexican soldiers planted the marijuana in their truck. When they arrived at the military base, they say, they were blindfolded, tied up, hit with rifle butts, shocked with electricity and threatened with death.
Mexico's military is leading President Felipe CalderÃ³n's war against the nation's drug cartels, and Ciudad JuÃ¡rez has emerged as one of the bloodiest battlegrounds. Nationwide, drug violence has claimed more than 25,000 lives since 2006--with government security forces accounting for an estimated 7% of the dead. In June alone, 103 police and soldiers were killed.
As the death toll rises, however, so have complaints about the military's tactics in trying to break the drug cartels' stranglehold on Mexican society. The human-rights office of the state of Chihuahua, where Ciudad JuÃ¡rez is located, is investigating some 465 cases of alleged abuse and torture of Mexican citizens by soldiers. Gustavo de la Rosa, the office's ombudsman in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, says he knows of about 70 cases in which soldiers are alleged to have planted evidence, including some involving suitcases packed with marijuana.
Allegations of mistreatment of suspects have caught the eye of the U.S. Senate committee that oversees financial aid to Mexico for its war on drugs. In an internal report, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says it received allegations of serious human-rights violations in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez last year. The report cites an unidentified young man picked up in El Paso who said he was arrested by the Mexican military in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez and beaten and shocked. The man said he was released after the military concluded he had no useful information about trafficking, the report says.
Mr. Huckabee says he was subjected to similar tactics. "I believe what was done to me was torture," he said in an interview. "When I did not answer their questions, they shocked me with a wire that was in my hands. My whole body froze up. The pain went from bearable to a point where I couldn't even talk."
Mexican prosecutors say the two men were caught red-handed. Two soldiers involved in their arrest testified at their trial that they counted 99 packages of marijuana in the suitcases, weighing more than 100 pounds.
Messrs. Huckabee and Quijas say they've never been involved with drugs and would never have tried to cross the border with two suitcases of marijuana. During their trial, they produced three witnesses who testified that they saw soldiers put suitcases into Mr. Huckabee's truck. A verdict is expected this month. Each man faces up to 25 years in prison.
Representatives of Mexico's military and of President CalderÃ³n turned down requests for interviews. In a written response to questions from The Wall Street Journal, the army said it briefly took the Americans to the military compound but didn't torture them. "We categorically deny that soldiers use these methods, and say their actions are in total adherence to the law," the statement said.
The army previously has dismissed complaints of abuse as the work of people allied with drug traffickers who want to drive soldiers out of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez. "Many times they make human-rights complaints because they want to limit our capacity for action and besmirch the institution," said Brigadier Gen. JesÃºs HernÃ¡ndez PÃ©rez, commander of the 4th Artillery Regiment, in an interview late last year.
The Wall Street Journal interviewed nine residents of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez--some of whom had been convicted of crimes--who said they were tortured by soldiers at the main army camp on the outskirts of the city.
A 33-year-old forklift operator said he had a firearm pointed to his head and was told he would be killed during a 48-hour interrogation. Two brothers, ages 53 and 56, said the military put plastic bags over their heads, shocked them and staged mock executions. A 25-year-old construction worker said soldiers used a Taser to shock his testicles. A 54-year-old diabetic rancher said he was blindfolded, beaten and shocked on his testicles, elbows and hands. He showed a reporter scars.
Between 2006 to 2009, complaints to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission about the military grew tenfold, to about 4,000, including allegations of robbery, rape, torture and killing. The allegations threaten to undermine public support for President CalderÃ³n's military campaign against traffickers. Some 50,000 soldiers now patrol the country.
In its statement, the military said it doesn't use torture under any circumstance. In Mexico, soldiers answer to their own military court system and not to civilian authorities, which means states can't prosecute them for abuse.
The case of the two Americans comes as political tensions along the U.S.-Mexico border have risen over issues such as illegal immigration and the trafficking of U.S. firearms into Mexico. Under the 2007 Merida Initiative, the U.S. agreed to provide Mexico with $1.3 billion to fight drug traffickers, including more than $420 million for the Mexican military. U.S. lawmakers have threatened to withhold 15%--nearly $200 million--if there are human-rights violations or other problems.
Mr. Huckabee grew up in El Paso. Friends recall he didn't have much taste for Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, which before the escalating violence was known locally for teenage partying. On weekends, he was likely to be found hunting with his father or riding his dirt bike in the desert.
When he was 18, he borrowed money to start a small construction company, Site Solutions, a business that consumed much of his time. In 2008, he got married.
Records searches in El Paso County and in New Mexico reveal that Mr. Huckabee had been charged with speeding and illegal dumping, but contain no indication of involvement with drugs. The records showed no criminal trouble for his close friend Mr. Quijas, whom Mr. Huckabee had gotten to know on construction jobs.
On Dec. 18, Mr. Huckabee finished work midday and prepared to head to Ciudad JuÃ¡rez to take his father's pickup truck for some inexpensive repair work, he and his father say. With him was Mr. Quijas, who says he had asked for a ride across the border to visit an ill grandfather.
Mr. Huckabee says he dropped Mr. Quijas off around 1 p.m., then drove to a repair shop and waited there. The repairs were finished around sunset, close to 5 p.m., according to the mechanic who did the work.
Mr. Huckabee says he made his way through rush-hour traffic and found Mr. Quijas at Abraham Lincoln Street, not far from the Bridge of the Americas leading into Texas. Around 6:40 p.m., the two say, they were passing Los Caballos, a well-known monument of running horses, when their car was surrounded by three Mexican military trucks.
"They grabbed us and threw us under a bench" in the back of a truck, says Mr. Huckabee. Their shirts were pulled over their heads as blindfolds, they say. The soldiers drove about a half hour to a military compound.
The two Americans were ordered out. Mr. Huckabee says a soldier pulled his wedding ring off his finger. (Neither the ring nor a cellphone taken earlier have been returned, he says.) The two men were separated. Each was examined by a doctor.
Mr. Quijas, who speaks both Spanish and English, says his eyes were wrapped with medical gauze. An interrogator, he says, asked him about the whereabouts of various people, using nicknames he didn't recognize. He says his interrogator threatened that some other men would force him to talk.
Mr. Quijas was moved to another room, he says, where his hands and feet were tied. He was wetted down with water, and he could hear the hum of a machine, he says.
Then someone shocked him with a metal rod on his testicles, neck, legs, back and anus, he says. He was taken back to the interrogator, questioned, then shocked again, he says.
Elsewhere, Mr. Huckabee, who speaks little Spanish, was being questioned, too. He was still blindfolded. His interrogator, he says, put objects in his hand, including what seemed to him to be drug paraphernalia, and asked him, in broken English, where they came from. He says he replied that he didn't know. Soldiers struck him repeatedly with the butt of a rifle, he says. Someone put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger, he says, but it wasn't loaded.
Briefly, the two Americans were put together in a cold room. Then, Mr. Huckabee, still blindfolded, was taken away again, he says. He says he heard a voice telling him, in fluent English, that he had been caught with marijuana, cocaine and guns. He says he was told to put a wire into his hand.
When he denied knowing about the marijuana, he says, he was shocked. He was shocked repeatedly during the questioning, he says. "They said they could electrocute me if I didn't answer the truth," he says.
Court documents say the two men were booked between midnight and 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 19--roughly five or six hours after the time they say they were arrested. They were charged with drug possession and transferred to the municipal prison.
The following day, in a statement entered into the court record, Mr. Huckabee said he had been hit by soldiers and given "electric shocks." He says he discussed his treatment when visited by a U.S. consular officer on Dec. 19. A U.S. official says Mr. Huckabee didn't mention mistreatment until Dec. 28.
American officials say U.S. consulates see numerous cases every year of Americans arrested in Mexico, and the consulates don't get involved in defending them. Consular officials informed Mr. Huckabee's family that they couldn't represent their son or offer legal advice.
Neither Mr. Huckabee nor Mr. Quijas made a formal complaint with U.S. or Mexican authorities, saying they feared retaliation by soldiers then working at the jail. In the trial, they accused their captors of torture. The soldiers denied doing so.
Two medical examinations describe the condition of the Americans following their arrest. The first, conducted by a military doctor the night they were detained, found "no apparent harm" on either man. The military said the exam took place at 10:45 p.m.
Another doctor, Dr. Hugo Tabares, examined the men at 2:50 the following afternoon, after they were handed over to civilian authorities. He found bruising on both men, according to a report he filed that day. He reported a reddish-brown bruise on Mr. Huckabee's chest and several bruises on Mr. Quijas's right arm and left leg.
In a brief interview in his office, Dr. Tabares said there were "various bruises" on Mr. Huckabee's body that "could have been caused the previous day." He declined to speculate on the cause of the injuries. In a statement to the court, on Feb. 3, Dr. Tabares said the bruising had been "caused by a blunt instrument or object."
The military said in its statement to the Journal that it didn't know of Dr. Tabares's exam and had no comment on it.
In the Mexican judicial system, testimony isn't given in an open courtroom before a jury, but in office cubicles in front of lawyers. Typically, neither the judge nor the defendant is present. The judge rules based on the transcript and case file.
The trial of the two Americans unfolded in scattered hearings over the past six months. Two soldiers involved in the arrest testified that they searched the vehicle because the Americans were "acting nervously." The search, prosecutors said, turned up the two suitcases filled with a substance that later testing showed was marijuana. Prosecutors said it belonged to the two men.
Testimony from three Mexican witnesses at the scene--people who said they didn't know the Americans--contradicted the army's version of events.
JosÃ© Antonio Bujanda, 21, told the court on Feb. 26 that he saw soldiers pull over Messrs. Huckabee and Quijas while he was washing windows of cars lined up to cross the bridge into Texas. He said he saw soldiers plant the suitcases in Mr. Huckabee's gray Dodge Ram.
"The two soldiers went to their own truck. I saw them take out two suitcases, then put them in the gray truck," he said.
Abraham Antero Torres, a 19-year-old candy seller, testified that he saw the same. "The military men that were behind took out two black traveler's suitcases and put them into the Ram, and that was it," he said.
A third witness, Fernando MonsivÃ¡is, another window washer, told the court: "The soldiers put the suitcases in the truck, the young men's truck."
Mr. Bujanda was shot and killed in front of his home by an unknown assailant on July 2. Attempts to reach Messrs. Torres and MonsivÃ¡is to comment were unsuccessful.
Alejandro Dominguez, a fingerprint expert hired by Mr. Huckabee's family, testified in March that the marijuana packages showed no signs of his fingerprints.
Court transcripts show a contradiction between when the Americans say they were arrested, at 6:40 p.m. on the road, and the official military account, which puts the time three hours later in a parking lot alongside the road. Under the military's timeline, the pair were arrested, taken to the base, then immediately taken to civil authorities, as Mexican law requires, leaving no time for lengthy interrogation.
A record of Mr. Huckabee's cellphone calls that evening, provided by his family, appears consistent with his account. The bill shows calls made throughout the day, ending at 6:38 p.m., minutes before he says he was arrested.
Mr. de la Rosa, the ombudsman of the state human-rights office in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, offers one theory about why the truck was stopped. A Mexican relative of Mr. Quijas whose name is similar, he says, is believed to be involved in the drug trade in town. Mr. de la Rosa speculates that the arrest may have been a case of mistaken identity. Mr. Quijas, who says he doesn't know his relative well, says that when he arrived at the jail, other inmates confused him with the relative.
Mr. de la Rosa says that if the soldiers confused Mr. Quijas with his relative, they wouldn't necessarily be inclined to turn him loose once they discovered his true identity. Winning a conviction, he says, would undermine potential complaints from the two men about abuse.
In its statement, the military said there was no confusion over the men's identities.
As they await a verdict, the two Americans share a cell with four other prisoners on the second floor of the Ciudad JuÃ¡rez Center for Social Readaptation. The crowded facility houses some dangerous men. In June, three prison employees were shot by gang members.
Mr. Huckabee says defending himself in a foreign land hasn't been easy. A translator recruited for one hearing this spring, according to the transcript, said: "I don't speak English very well." The hearing continued.
Mr. Huckabee has been through five defense lawyers, none of whom speaks English. One lawyer who reviewed the case said recently he believed that crimes result from "demons entering the body and taking control, as Paul says in the Bible." One of his lawyers was shot and wounded in May, while exiting the prosecutor's offices.

Full text: Author: Will Connors in Kampala, Uganda, Siobhan Gorman in Washington, D.C.,; Sarah Childress
The terror group behind last weekend's deadly Uganda blasts recruited a local man to coordinate the attacks and received funds from al Qaeda, say investigators, as it extends its reach beyond lawless Somalia.
Al Shabaab, the Somalia-based group that has claimed responsibility for July 11's triple suicide blasts that killed 76 people in Uganda's capital, Kampala, has in recent months built up Pakistan-style terror training camps. One top leader, Sheikh Muktar Robow, has helped to transform the group from a local insurgency into a global jihadist organization modeled on, and swearing allegiance to, al Qaeda.
That picture of the group, and its development under Mr. Robow, emerged from interviews with Ugandan, Kenyan and U.S. investigators; current and former U.S. intelligence officials; and Somalis, including a member of the militant group.
A U.S. intelligence official said information gleaned from militant communications shows links between al Shabaab and al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and Yemen. U.S. officials also see evidence of overlap in training and membership and say their working assumption is that al Shabaab has several hundred core members, similar to the numbers in al Qaeda in Pakistan and in al Qaeda's Yemeni outpost.
Intelligence officials say they believe al Qaeda is using the Somali group as a symbiotic host body, allowing its operatives access to other African countries. "As much as we're looking at al Shabaab, they are riding on the back of a more experienced player," said Col. Herbert Mbonye, the director of counterterrorism for Uganda's military intelligence body.
That relationship has raised red flags at U.S. intelligence agencies. In the past 18 months, militant training camps have emerged in Somalia similar to those that developed in Pakistan's tribal areas, a U.S. intelligence official said. Intelligence officials are now following about two dozen individuals from the U.S. and other Western countries who may have been affiliated with al Shabaab, or gone through these camps.
"It's quite an alarming story," the U.S. intelligence official said.
Al Shabaab's relationship with al Qaeda appears to have been cultivated in part by Mr. Robow, a top commander. Also known as Abu Mansur, he is among the U.S. government's most wanted terrorists.
Mr. Robow offered a warning of sorts ahead of Sunday's blasts, which hit a restaurant and a sports club where people had gathered to watch the final match of the World Cup. Speaking during a public address at Friday prayers earlier this month, Mr. Robow called for attacks against countries that had sent some 6,000 troops under African Union auspices to support the Somali government's offensive against al Shabaab. "We tell the Muslim youths and Mujahedeen, wherever they are in the Muslim world, to attack, explode and burn the embassies of Burundi and Uganda," Mr. Robow said, according to local media reports.
Mr. Robow grew up in southern Mogadishu as a devoted student of the Quran, according to public speeches he has made. He studied law at the University of Khartoum in Sudan, and then returned to Mogadishu to teach Arabic for several years. He is about 40, U.S. officials believe, based on a birth date on an Eritrean passport he used.
In 2000, Mr. Robow traveled to Afghanistan to train with the Taliban and al Qaeda, which used the strife-torn South Asian country to plot the Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S. In Afghanistan, Mr. Robow learned to fight, fire a sniper rifle and conceal roadside bombs, an al Shabaab official in Somalia said. He stayed less than a year, leaving before U.S.-led forces swept into Afghanistan.
Back in Somalia, Mr. Robow became a member of the Union of Islamic Courts, which aimed to establish strict Shariah law in the country, which had been largely lawless for a decade. The group came to power in 2006. Mr. Robow helped to establish an Islamist government and founded al Shabaab, a youth brigade that would serve as the union's armed wing.
The Islamist government soon collapsed. Al Shabaab endured. Mr. Robow, a skilled orator, became an al Shabaab spokesman and eventually deputy commander.
Al Shabaab, which controls vast territory in Somalia, has been engaged in a running battle with Somalia's transitional federal government. The group has pinned the government to a strip of the capital, Mogadishu, and largely prevented officials and parliament from meeting.
Beyond his ambition to overthrow Somalia's government, Mr. Robow has advocated linking the group's ambitions to global jihad. Through media interviews and in videos posted online, he sought to attract fighters in Afghanistan, Chechnya and Iraq, largely because foreign recruits could replenish al Shabaab's ranks and aid its finances. In a 2008 interview, he lamented that there "are not enough non-Somali brothers."
The same year, the U.S. Treasury Department declared al Shabaab a terrorist group and named Mr. Robow its "spiritual leader." Mr. Robow later released a statement saying the group was "honored" to be included on the list but expressed disappointment al Shabaab wasn't ranked higher.
Senior U.S. administration officials said some foreign fighters who answered Mr. Robow's calls--some of whom have "close links" with al Qaeda--came with experience, funding and the agenda of establishing Somalia as a base from which to attack Western targets.
The foreigners also brought new tactics. Roadside bombs and suicide blasts, once unheard-of in Somalia, are now part of al Shabaab's armory. The group's commanders have banned dancing, mustaches and, most recently, watching World Cup games on television. Fighters punish offenders with floggings or public amputations.
On Wednesday, armed al Shabaab fighters drove through towns in southern Somalia, blaring a warning to residents through megaphones mounted on their vehicles, according to witnesses contacted by telephone. "You must collaborate with [us] and allow your sons to fight the enemy of Allah," Abu Maryama, a senior al Shabaab official told crowds in the southwestern town of Baidoa. "If you pay no heed to this ...you will be considered as another enemy and face punishment."
Harsh retribution and indiscriminate deaths have sapped public support for the group, and created rifts within it. Mr. Robow has been caught between those who want to focus the insurgency in Somali--and retain a measure of popular support-- and the global jihadists who don't care about local backing, according the al Shabaab colleague. Mr. Robow, a Somali who has long opposed foreign intervention in his country, may not be considered radical enough for the new agenda, according to a recent report by the International Crisis Group, a Brussels based think tank.In the Uganda attack, the group's two factions apparently found middle ground.
The blasts have presented U.S. officials with a quandary. They see a need to step up support and involvement in the region, but they haven't determined the best course. "Violence always breeds urgency," the U.S. intelligence official said. "The question is: What [to do]?" The U.S. has been tracking al Shabaab and al Qaeda in Somalia for years, officials say. The Central Intelligence Agency works with military special forces units to collect intelligence and pinpoint targets, a former senior intelligence official said. The U.S. also works closely with the Ethiopian and Kenyan governments on counterterrorism operations.
Those efforts have grown in recent years as U.S. officials discovered as many as 20 Americans from Minnesota making their way to Somalia, including one who was determined to have been among five suicide bombers in an October 2008 attack in northern Somalia.
The intelligence-gathering paid off last year when U.S. Special Forces killed Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a top operative linked to both al Qaeda and al Shabaab who was believed to be linked to 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
But U.S. Special Forces units and intelligence officials have been grappling with a broader response to the growing terror threat from Somalia. Calling in airstrikes could fuel retaliatory measures against a weak Somali government. It could also stir up anti-U.S. sentiment that would advance the group's agenda, said the U.S. intelligence official.
"If you strike a camp, it makes you feel good, but what do you do the next day?" the official said. "You don't effectively eliminate the threat."
On Thursday, an al Shabaab leader underscored that point, delivering a message on the radio in Mogadishu congratulating what he called the Martyr Saleh Nabhan Brigade for the Kampala attacks.
Intelligence agencies have warned about al Shabaab's growing ambition to attack other countries--particularly Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya--as well as the West, the U.S. intelligence official said.U.S. intelligence hadn't picked up many direct threats against Uganda, but there has been a general concern about attacks targeting countries that supply troops to A.U. forces.
Investigators in Uganda say they are questioning a Ugandan man, Ali Isa Ssenkumba, who they say has confessed to helping plan the attacks.
Mr. Ssenkumba, who is in his late thirties and hails from a farming community outside Kampala, told investigators he was recruited by Somali men who persuaded him that he could have success in business in Somalia, according to a Ugandan military official close to the investigation.
Posing as a businessman, Mr. Ssenkumba made frequent trips to Somalia, where he attended an al Shabaab training camp, the Ugandan official said. Mr. Ssenkumba told investigators many other Ugandans are at al Shabaab's Somalia training facilities.
This person says Mr. Ssenkumba become familiar with guards at the borders between Uganda and Sudan and Uganda and Kenya, and received money and coordinated logistics for roughly two dozen al Shabaab members in Uganda who are suspected of plotting the triple suicide blast. Mr. Ssenkumba said, and investigators say they separately determined, that the attack was partially funded by informal money transfers from al Qaeda in Afghanistan.
Police in Kenya said they arrested Mr. Ssenkumba last week, before the attack, and handed him over to Ugandan investigators Tuesday, after the bombings.
According to Nicholas Kamwende, the commanding officer of Kenya's anti-terrorism police unit, Mr. Ssenkumba walked up to an immigration officer on the Kenya-Somalia border some time before the Kampala attacks and turned himself in.
"He said he didn't want to stay any longer with al Shabaab, that he wanted to go home," Mr. Kamwende said. "We didn't have anything to hold him on and we thought the Ugandans would be in a better position to exploit what he knew."
Mr. Ssenkumba wasn't made available to comment and it wasn't immediately apparent whether he was represented by a lawyer. Neither Mr. Kamwende nor Ugandan officials would say whether Mr. Ssenkumba provided information before the impending attack. Ugandan officials say Mr. Ssenkumba didn't turn himself in voluntarily.

Full text: Authorities in Utah said Friday that at least two state employees may have been responsible for compiling and distributing a list containing the names and personal information of 1,300 people who, the senders charged, are illegal immigrants and should be deported immediately.
The employees, who were placed on leave, work for the Department of Workforce Services, which maintains a database containing information matching that on the list. More state employees also might be involved, and officials said the investigation into the list continues.
The list, sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Salt Lake City in April, was redistributed this week with additional names to Utah lawmakers, news organizations and police chiefs. The senders called themselves Concerned Citizens of the United States and demanded that authorities begin deporting people on the list.
The list included addresses, Social Security numbers and even whether some women were pregnant. "Most likely both federal and state privacy laws may have been violated," Utah Atty. Gen. Mark L. Shurtleff said Friday.
Shurtleff, speaking in a teleconference from Salt Lake City, was joined by immigrant rights advocates, a lawmaker and the head of a group that promotes stronger immigration controls in denouncing the list.
Shurtleff and the others sounded similar themes -- that a new Arizona law to control illegal immigration was promoting anti-immigrant sentiment and that the aggressive nature of the list did not reflect the welcoming nature of Utah.
"I know that the good people of Utah won't have any of this," said Paul T. Mero, president of the Sutherland Institute, a conservative think tank.
The speakers also said that the federal government's failure to enact a comprehensive overhaul of immigration rules, with a path to citizenship for illegal residents, helped foment anger and ill will against illegal immigrants.

Abstract: [...] the number of immigration-related laws and resolutions enacted by states surged to 333 last year, up from 32 in 2005, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. "Lawmakers are frustrated with the federal inaction," said Ann Morse, program director for the organization's Immigrant Policy Project. [...] the federal government acts, states will still see this as an area where they see the need to play a leadership role.

Full text: Colorado restricts illegal immigrants from receiving in-state tuition. Nebraska requires verification of immigration status to obtain public benefits. In Tennessee, knowingly presenting a false ID card to get a job is a misdemeanor.
Arizona's strict new law has generated the most controversy, but there are hundreds of immigration-related laws on the books across the country. The laws regulate employment, law enforcement, education, benefits and healthcare.
The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit last week to stop the Arizona law from taking effect July 29, saying that immigration policy is a national responsibility and "a patchwork of state laws will only create more problems than it solves." But according to experts, that is precisely what exists.
In fact, the number of immigration-related laws and resolutions enacted by states surged to 333 last year, up from 32 in 2005, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. And during the first three months of 2010, lawmakers introduced more than 1,000 bills and resolutions, though it's too early to tell how many will become law. Bills on topics such as employment verification and driver's license requirements are on the table in 45 states.
"Lawmakers are frustrated with the federal inaction," said Ann Morse, program director for the organization's Immigrant Policy Project. "Until the federal government acts, states will still see this as an area where they see the need to play a leadership role."
Already, the organization says, legislators in five states -- South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Michigan -- have introduced similar bills to Arizona's SB 1070, which requires police to check the immigration status of people they lawfully stop and suspect are in the country illegally. As of last month, six resolutions had been passed in five states regarding SB 1070 -- four opposing it and two supporting it. The law has prompted lawsuits, protests and boycotts.
"I frankly understand the position Arizona finds itself in," said Virginia state Sen. John Watkins. "We all live in elected republics. The pressure gets put on, especially in tough economic times."
Watkins said he is frustrated that Congress cannot get beyond the politics on immigration. "The federal government has walked away from its responsibility. They are the reason states are scrambling."
In a speech this month at American University, President Obama called for comprehensive immigration reform but did not set any timetable for legislation to be introduced.
States have a long history of enacting immigration laws. In 1996, after Congress denied welfare to most legal immigrants, states stepped in with laws to provide safety net services. And following the Sept. 11 attacks, state lawmakers passed bills aimed at protecting national security.
"People were concerned about dangerous immigrants in their midst, and they thought they should take matters into their own hands," said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute's office at New York University School of Law.
The increase in state laws parallels the changing settlement patterns of illegal immigrants. Between 1990 and 2008, illegal immigration slowed significantly in California but grew in Georgia, North Carolina and other states, according to a 2009 Pew Hispanic Center report.
"These are not your typical immigrant-receiving states, so they are not accustomed to having large immigrant populations," said Michele Waslin, senior analyst at the Immigration Policy Center. "They are struggling with how to deal with new populations."
Citizen groups also noticed the demographic change and the federal government's inaction.
Carol Helm, retired from the oil and gas industry, started an organization in 2004 called Immigration Reform for Oklahoma Now. She began working with state lawmakers to draft legislation that would restrict the rights of illegal immigrants, who were arriving in large numbers in search of jobs. Lawmakers passed the bill in 2007, limiting the ability of illegal immigrants to get public assistance and giving police the authority to check the immigration status of anyone arrested.
"The constituents' voices were heard," Helm said. "They are the ones who actually pushed it."
Not all of the laws are anti-immigrant, said Suman Raghunathan, immigration policy specialist at the Progressive States Network. Ten states have passed laws to allow undocumented college students to pay in-state tuition, and several have expanded access to state-funded health benefits and improved enforcement of wage and hour laws.
"There is an alternative way to look at this ... for legislators to realize the value of integrating and welcoming immigrants and immigrant families to their states," she said.
Washington state Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos said that although immigration falls under the federal government's jurisdiction, states are responsible for illegal immigrants living within their borders. States have to pay the bulk of the cost for education, healthcare and incarceration of illegal immigrants, and they must help newcomers integrate.
Santos said the conflicting laws from state to state can create confusion. For example, a company may have offices in two states -- in one that requires employment verification and in one that doesn't.
"It is exactly those kinds of issues that need to be worked out at the federal level so that there is no question across the 50 states as to what the rules are," she said.
Santos said states generally agree that the enforcement of civil immigration policy is a federal responsibility. "It is not a responsibility that states necessarily want," she said.
But Federation for American Immigration Reform President Dan Stein said immigration policy is inevitably a partnership between states and the federal government. The states are "the keys to the kingdom" -- where immigrants get identification documents, services and jobs, he said.
"If you try only to control immigration at the border ... it's an exercise in futility," he said. "National immigration policy can only be carried out with the participation of the states."

A law that makes it illegal to lie about being a war hero is unconstitutional because it violates free speech, a federal judge ruled Friday.
U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn dismissed a case against Rick Glen Strandlof, who claimed he was an ex-Marine who was wounded in Iraq and received the Purple Heart and the Silver Star. The military had no record that Strandlof had ever served, and he was charged with violating the Stolen Valor Act, which makes it a crime punishable by up to a year in jail to falsely claim to have won a military medal.
Blackburn ruled that the government did not show it has a compelling reason to restrict that type of statement.

UTAH
Utah officials said Friday they have identified at least two state employees who apparently accessed confidential government documents to create a list of 1,300 purported illegal immigrants that was then mailed to law enforcement officials and the news media.
Gov. Gary R. Herbert (R) said the two employees work for the Department of Workforce Services, the agency that administers food stamp programs and other public benefits. The employees have been placed on administrative leave, and the state attorney general will determine whether to file criminal charges against the pair.
"The people we've identified certainly have some strong political opinions and seem to be frustrated with some of the issues around immigration," said Kristen Cox, the department's executive director.

Full text: When last we heard from Tito Munoz, he was onstage with Sarah Palin at a rally in Leesburg in the waning days of the 2008 presidential campaign, a burly guy in a yellow hard hat, trying to bellow some life into the GOP ticket.
"Good morning, Virginia!" he boomed. "You can call me Tito the Builder!"
Palin worked him into her stump speeches, this Latino Joe the Plumber who, she liked to say, "was born in Colombia but made in the U.S.A.!"
On a recent Saturday morning, Munoz has exchanged his boots and tool belt for a pressed shirt and slacks. He squeezes behind a microphone in a small radio studio in Laurel. He clears space on the table for a pile of books and essays, including "The Constitutional Thoughts of Thomas Jefferson," "Cesar Chavez Against Illegals," "Hispanics in American Wars" and Spanish translations of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
It's minutes to airtime for his debut as Tito the Radio Host. He's a little frantic.
"Can I have the questions, Mama?" he says to Deborah, his wife. "Where are my glasses?"
They are on his head.
He orders the engineer to cue up his theme song, "America," by the late Nino Bravo, with the chorus, in Spanish: "When God made Eden he thought of America."
The engineer counts down, the on-air light pops on, and Munoz unleashes a verbal torrent, in Spanish.
"Bienvenidos a 'America Eres Tu,' " he says, welcome to "America Is You." "We Latinos are the largest minority in the United States. We must take our place in history and preserve the vision of the Founding Fathers of this nation."
Los Padres de la Patria! His tone deepens with emotion.
"It's our duty and our responsibility. Because we are America . . . "
Thirty-five minutes later, he remembers to stop and introduce himself.
Tito Munoz, 50, is the voice and the irrepressible personality of a new effort by some local conservative Latinos to claim more bandwidth in the political conversation taking place in Spanish. A core group of a half-dozen small-business owners has organized into the Conservative Hispanic Coalition; another 24 supporters are less active members.
"America Eres Tu" is the group's main project, a weekly one-hour paid program Saturdays at 9 a.m. on Radio Viva 900 AM. The group expects to pay nearly $20,000 for the first year, largely out of members' own pockets.
For now, the effort is more notable for its inspiration than its impact. Arbitron estimates that 500 people listened to Radio Viva at 9 a.m. on Saturdays in May, before "America Eres Tu" debuted. But station management claims that listenership could be 10 times higher now, because the May paid-programming was not as appealing.
Elsewhere on the dial, Spanish-language radio is dominated by music, hyper-local nonpartisan community affairs and paid call-in hours with lawyers, mortgage brokers and credit counselors.
Hispanic conservatism would seem to be a tough sell these days. Many Latinos -- including citizens and legal residents -- are smarting from the tough anti-illegal-immigrant rhetoric of leading GOP conservatives. And many are dismayed by the strict new state law signed by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona.
These Latino conservatives condemn the most extreme of anti-immigrant views, though neither do they favor what critics call a blanket "amnesty" for illegal immigrants. Their basic premises are that conservatism is bigger than the immigration issue and that the conservative movement is losing potential followers before they even learn English and join mainstream society.
"Many Hispanics are not happy with the Republican Party," says Laura Ramirez-Drain, a founder of the coalition who runs a marketing business in Washington and is herself a Republican activist. "We just want to explain the values of conservatism."
Latinos voted for Obama over McCain by a margin of more than 2 to 1, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.
Ramirez-Drain, a naturalized citizen from Mexico, calculates that more Latinos will join the GOP if they recognize the conservative values they share with the party. "We need to do this to begin to prepare for 2012," she says.
Fabiola Clausen, president of a printing and graphics company in Washington and a native of Colombia, says she was offended when she became a citizen in the early 1990s and Democratic recruiters assumed she would register with them because -- didn't she know? -- the Dems are supposedly the party of "la gente," the people.
"I'm pro-life," Clausen says. "I like small government. I don't want to live off the government."
Despite her differences with Democrats, she voted for Obama because of his promise to address immigration reform in the first year. "I fell for that," she says.
The first edition of "America Eres Tu" is filled with admonitions to go to college, take part in the political process. Munoz speaks passionately in Spanish about the importance of learning English to get ahead. His first guest is a family therapist from Honduras named Luis Padilla, who tells his uplifting story of learning English, going to college and volunteering on political campaigns.
"You just need the will, the desire and the guts!" Munoz says.
People start calling in, including some in other states listening over the Internet. The phone number is posted on Munoz's Facebook page. (He has 3,500 Facebook friends.) When Modesto of Maryland starts complaining about the "barriers" that Latinos face in an increasingly anti-immigrant atmosphere, Munoz politely shuts him down.
"I disagree that people are trying to take away your dream," he says. "The dream is yours. You make the dream. You follow it. You achieve it."
Munoz immigrated to New York with a student visa in the mid-1970s when he was 16, and ultimately got a green card. He worked construction and married Deborah 15 years ago after they met at a wedding. While working, he earned two degrees from Northern Virginia Community College and has started on a third.
Tito and Deborah started DeBorn Construction in Woodbridge, which has four employees, down from nine a year ago, because of the dragging economy. The company prepares sites for development. Munoz wears a hard hat and works side by side with his men. The company has a project now at Fort Belvoir. Bumper stickers on Munoz's Chevy truck say "Socialism Isn't Cool" and "Palin Power."
He became a citizen in fall 2008 and dived right into the McCain campaign. Lately he has attended "tea party" rallies. "We have to do everything we can to keep this country the way it was founded," he says.
Munoz and his radio cohorts are up to something unusual, says Alberto Acereda, a professor of Spanish literature at Arizona State University who has argued that "there is a vacuum when it comes to Spanish-language conservative media." That is starting to change, Acereda says in an interview, but still, "most of the press in Spanish tends to be more on the liberal side, and more supporting the Democratic Party."
Acereda is also the content director for another stab at conservative communication: a bilingual news and opinion Web site launched a year ago by Newt Gingrich -- an avid student of Spanish -- called TheAmericano.com.
Alex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, says conservative Latinos exaggerate their shutout from the airwaves. Spanish-language media are opinionated in favor of immigration reform, he says, but beyond that, "primarily it's about entertainment. There's no right or left . . . as there is on the English-language side of the radio and television."
Munoz's hour at the microphone is ending. "Next week we're going to talk about why the economy is destroyed in this country," he concludes.
Afterward, Tito the Radio Host is so exhilarated, he spills his bottle of water on his copy of the Constitution in Spanish. The Constitution can take a little water, he allows, but "the Constitution can't take anymore months of Obama." He might say so on the air next week. This week, he admits, he was a little less provocative.
"This is my first time, I don't know what I'm doing," he says. "Everything, I learn from scratch. America is the place where everything you want to do, you do!"

MELBOURNE--With Australia's ruling party and the opposition both casting themselves as fiscal conservatives, the upcoming Aug. 21 election will be a contest to establish economic credibility, with key policy battles likely to include climate change, mining taxes and stemming the flow of "boat people" into the country.
The ruling Labor Party, seeking to capitalize on a bounce in opinion polls after Julia Gillard took over June 24 as Australia's first female prime minister, has moved to neutralize issues where the conservative Liberal-National coalition enjoyed an advantage among voters, signaling more populist stances on issues such as immigration and population growth.
Clem Macintyre, head of Adelaide University's school of politics, said polling showed Ms. Gillard was benefiting from the honeymoon period normally granted to new leaders. A Nielsen poll published this week showed Labor with a 52%-48% lead over the coalition. Asked about their preferred prime minister, respondents chose Ms. Gillard over her conservative rival Tony Abbott, by 56% to 35%.
Both sides agree on issues such as Australia's commitment to the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan and encouraging the economic relationship with China.
John Warhurst, a political scientist at Canberra's Australian National University, said the narrow policy gap opened the way for a presidential-style campaign where the emphasis was on Ms. Gillard and Mr. Abbott.
"I think personalities will be more than usually important in this election," Mr. Warhurst said. "I don't think either side is likely to hare off in a radical direction; both sides will stick to the common ground."
He said both Ms. Gillard and Mr. Abbott would claim superior economic management skills, with Labor arguing that a fiscal stimulus package delivered last year--amounting to 2% of gross domestic product in 2009--helped Australia avoid recession during the global financial crisis.
Mr. Abbott says much of the stimulus was squandered. He is likely to center his attack on cost blowouts in a A$16.2 billion school-building program overseen by then-Education Secretary Ms. Gillard, which critics say represents a low in her ministerial career.
Ms. Gillard said her top priority upon becoming prime minister was ending the controversy over plans for a new 40% tax on "super profits" in the resources sector, which contributed to the downfall of her predecessor Kevin Rudd.
By offering major concessions--including reducing the headline tax rate to 30% and limiting the new levy to coal and iron ore--Ms. Gillard sought to placate furious mining industry executives and sideline the issue during the campaign. The government announced the revised proposal July 2.
Mr. Abbott is determined to keep the issue on the agenda, warning that the tax will "choke the golden goose" by penalizing one of Australia's strongest export sectors and vowing to scrap it if he wins power. Mr. Macintyre said the changes Ms. Gillard pushed through on the tax proposal had at least taken the sting out of the debate.
"It may not swing votes to Labor but it will ease concerns and minimize its importance as a divisive political issue," he said.
He said Ms. Gillard would seek to re-establish credibility on climate change after Labor postponed the implementation of a carbon emissions trading plan, to the dismay of environmentalists.
Mr. Abbott--who has described the climate change argument as "absolute crap"--rejects emissions trading outright, preferring measures such as carbon sinks and forestry plantations that he says can deal with the problem at a fraction of the cost.
The conservative leader also says he would ditch Labor's plan for a multi-billion dollar national broadband network, saying it's a white elephant that would damage Telstra Corp., the country's dominant telecommunications player. Labor says the network is needed for Australia to compete in the digital world.
Another key difference is on asylum-seekers, where Abbott has adopted the tough "Pacific solution" policies that proved popular for conservatives in the past, including holding "boat people"--many from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka--in offshore detention centers.
Mr. Mcintyre said Ms. Gillard must find a balance between Labor's blue-collar supporters, who want tough action, and the party's progressives, who favor a softer approach.
She has proposed processing asylum seekers outside Australia in a regional center, raising the idea with East Timor's President Jose Ramos-Horta.
Regardless of who wins, Mr. Warhurst said Australia would continue with the generally centrist policies that have delivered prosperity in recent decades.
"While there will naturally be disappointment for the losing side, it will not impact on the direction of Australia," he said.

Abstract: The human-rights office of the state of Chihuahua, where Ciudad Juarez is located, is investigating some 465 cases of alleged abuse and torture of Mexican citizens by soldiers. "Many times they make human-rights complaints because they want to limit our capacity for action and besmirch the institution," said Brigadier Gen. Jesus Hernandez Perez, commander of the 4th Artillery Regiment, in an interview late last year.

Full text: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico -- Two Americans were driving back to El Paso, Texas, last December after an afternoon across the border in Ciudad Juarez. A few blocks from the border, they were surrounded by Mexican army trucks and pulled from their Dodge Ram.
Mexico's military says it found two suitcases full of marijuana in the cab of the pickup truck. Two soldiers later testified that they drove the two Americans to a military compound on the outskirts of town, questioned them briefly, then turned them over to civilian authorities. The Americans were charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell.
Those two men -- Shohn Huckabee, 23 years old, and Carlos Quijas, 36 -- are being held in a Ciudad Juarez jail. They tell a different story about what happened that night. They say Mexican soldiers planted the marijuana in their truck. When they arrived at the military base, they say, they were blindfolded, tied up, hit with rifle butts, shocked with electricity and threatened with death.
Mexico's military is leading President Felipe Calderon's war against the nation's drug cartels, and Ciudad Juarez has emerged as one of the bloodiest battlegrounds. Nationwide, drug violence has claimed more than 25,000 lives since 2006 -- with government security forces accounting for an estimated 7% of the dead. In June alone, 103 police and soldiers were killed.
As the death toll rises, however, so have complaints about the military's tactics in trying to break the drug cartels' stranglehold on Mexican society. The human-rights office of the state of Chihuahua, where Ciudad Juarez is located, is investigating some 465 cases of alleged abuse and torture of Mexican citizens by soldiers. Gustavo de la Rosa, the office's ombudsman in Ciudad Juarez, says he knows of about 70 cases in which soldiers are alleged to have planted evidence, including some involving suitcases packed with marijuana.
Allegations of mistreatment of suspects have caught the eye of the U.S. Senate committee that oversees financial aid to Mexico for its war on drugs. In an internal report, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says it received allegations of serious human-rights violations in Ciudad Juarez last year. The report cites an unidentified young man picked up in El Paso who said he was arrested by the Mexican military in Ciudad Juarez and beaten and shocked. The man said he was released after the military concluded he had no useful information about trafficking, the report says.
Mr. Huckabee says he was subjected to similar tactics. "I believe what was done to me was torture," he said in an interview. "When I did not answer their questions, they shocked me with a wire that was in my hands. My whole body froze up. The pain went from bearable to a point where I couldn't even talk."
Mexican prosecutors say the two men were caught red-handed. Two soldiers involved in their arrest testified at their trial that they counted 99 packages of marijuana in the suitcases, weighing more than 100 pounds.
Messrs. Huckabee and Quijas say they've never been involved with drugs and would never have tried to cross the border with two suitcases of marijuana. During their trial, they produced three witnesses who testified that they saw soldiers put suitcases into Mr. Huckabee's truck. A verdict is expected this month. Each man faces up to 25 years in prison.
Representatives of Mexico's military and of President Calderon turned down requests for interviews. In a written response to questions from The Wall Street Journal, the army said it briefly took the Americans to the military compound but didn't torture them. "We categorically deny that soldiers use these methods, and say their actions are in total adherence to the law," the statement said.
The army previously has dismissed complaints of abuse as the work of people allied with drug traffickers who want to drive soldiers out of Ciudad Juarez. "Many times they make human-rights complaints because they want to limit our capacity for action and besmirch the institution," said Brigadier Gen. Jesus Hernandez Perez, commander of the 4th Artillery Regiment, in an interview late last year.
The Wall Street Journal interviewed nine residents of Ciudad Juarez -- some of whom had been convicted of crimes -- who said they were tortured by soldiers at the main army camp on the outskirts of the city.
A 33-year-old forklift operator said he had a firearm pointed to his head and was told he would be killed during a 48-hour interrogation. Two brothers, ages 53 and 56, said the military put plastic bags over their heads, shocked them and staged mock executions. A 25-year-old construction worker said soldiers used a Taser to shock his testicles. A 54-year-old diabetic rancher said he was blindfolded, beaten and shocked on his testicles, elbows and hands. He showed a reporter scars.
Between 2006 to 2009, complaints to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission about the military grew tenfold, to about 4,000, including allegations of robbery, rape, torture and killing. The allegations threaten to undermine public support for President Calderon's military campaign against traffickers. Some 50,000 soldiers now patrol the country.
In its statement, the military said it doesn't use torture under any circumstance. In Mexico, soldiers answer to their own military court system and not to civilian authorities, which means states can't prosecute them for abuse.
The case of the two Americans comes as political tensions along the U.S.-Mexico border have risen over issues such as illegal immigration and the trafficking of U.S. firearms into Mexico. Under the 2007 Merida Initiative, the U.S. agreed to provide Mexico with $1.3 billion to fight drug traffickers, including more than $420 million for the Mexican military. U.S. lawmakers have threatened to withhold 15% -- nearly $200 million -- if there are human-rights violations or other problems.
Mr. Huckabee grew up in El Paso. Friends recall he didn't have much taste for Ciudad Juarez, which before the escalating violence was known locally for teenage partying. On weekends, he was likely to be found hunting with his father or riding his dirt bike in the desert.
When he was 18, he borrowed money to start a small construction company, Site Solutions, a business that consumed much of his time. In 2008, he got married.
Records searches in El Paso County and in New Mexico reveal that Mr. Huckabee had been charged with speeding and illegal dumping, but contain no indication of involvement with drugs. The records showed no criminal trouble for his close friend Mr. Quijas, whom Mr. Huckabee had gotten to know on construction jobs.
On Dec. 18, Mr. Huckabee finished work midday and prepared to head to Ciudad Juarez to take his father's pickup truck for some inexpensive repair work, he and his father say. With him was Mr. Quijas, who says he had asked for a ride across the border to visit an ill grandfather.
Mr. Huckabee says he dropped Mr. Quijas off around 1 p.m., then drove to a repair shop and waited there. The repairs were finished around sunset, close to 5 p.m., according to the mechanic who did the work.
Mr. Huckabee says he made his way through rush-hour traffic and found Mr. Quijas at Abraham Lincoln Street, not far from the Bridge of the Americas leading into Texas. Around 6:40 p.m., the two say, they were passing Los Caballos, a well-known monument of running horses, when their car was surrounded by three Mexican military trucks.
"They grabbed us and threw us under a bench" in the back of a truck, says Mr. Huckabee. Their shirts were pulled over their heads as blindfolds, they say. The soldiers drove about a half hour to a military compound.
The two Americans were ordered out. Mr. Huckabee says a soldier pulled his wedding ring off his finger. (Neither the ring nor a cellphone taken earlier have been returned, he says.) The two men were separated. Each was examined by a doctor.
Mr. Quijas, who speaks both Spanish and English, says his eyes were wrapped with medical gauze. An interrogator, he says, asked him about the whereabouts of various people, using nicknames he didn't recognize. He says his interrogator threatened that some other men would force him to talk.
Mr. Quijas was moved to another room, he says, where his hands and feet were tied. He was wetted down with water, and he could hear the hum of a machine, he says.
Then someone shocked him with a metal rod on his testicles, neck, legs, back and anus, he says. He was taken back to the interrogator, questioned, then shocked again, he says.
Elsewhere, Mr. Huckabee, who speaks little Spanish, was being questioned, too. He was still blindfolded. His interrogator, he says, put objects in his hand, including what seemed to him to be drug paraphernalia, and asked him, in broken English, where they came from. He says he replied that he didn't know. Soldiers struck him repeatedly with the butt of a rifle, he says. Someone put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger, he says, but it wasn't loaded.
Briefly, the two Americans were put together in a cold room. Then, Mr. Huckabee, still blindfolded, was taken away again, he says. He says he heard a voice telling him, in fluent English, that he had been caught with marijuana, cocaine and guns. He says he was told to put a wire into his hand.
When he denied knowing about the marijuana, he says, he was shocked. He was shocked repeatedly during the questioning, he says. "They said they could electrocute me if I didn't answer the truth," he says.
Court documents say the two men were booked between midnight and 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 19 -- roughly five or six hours after the time they say they were arrested. They were charged with drug possession and transferred to the municipal prison.
The following day, in a statement entered into the court record, Mr. Huckabee said he had been hit by soldiers and given "electric shocks." He says he discussed his treatment when visited by a U.S. consular officer on Dec. 19. A U.S. official says Mr. Huckabee didn't mention mistreatment until Dec. 28.
American officials say U.S. consulates see numerous cases every year of Americans arrested in Mexico, and the consulates don't get involved in defending them. Consular officials informed Mr. Huckabee's family that they couldn't represent their son or offer legal advice.
Neither Mr. Huckabee nor Mr. Quijas made a formal complaint with U.S. or Mexican authorities, saying they feared retaliation by soldiers then working at the jail. In the trial, they accused their captors of torture. The soldiers denied doing so.
Two medical examinations describe the condition of the Americans following their arrest. The first, conducted by a military doctor the night they were detained, found "no apparent harm" on either man. The military said the exam took place at 10:45 p.m.
Another doctor, Dr. Hugo Tabares, examined the men at 2:50 the following afternoon, after they were handed over to civilian authorities. He found bruising on both men, according to a report he filed that day. He reported a reddish-brown bruise on Mr. Huckabee's chest and several bruises on Mr. Quijas's right arm and left leg.
In a brief interview in his office, Dr. Tabares said there were "various bruises" on Mr. Huckabee's body that "could have been caused the previous day." He declined to speculate on the cause of the injuries. In a statement to the court, on Feb. 3, Dr. Tabares said the bruising had been "caused by a blunt instrument or object."
The military said in its statement to the Journal that it didn't know of Dr. Tabares's exam and had no comment on it.
In the Mexican judicial system, testimony isn't given in an open courtroom before a jury, but in office cubicles in front of lawyers. Typically, neither the judge nor the defendant is present. The judge rules based on the transcript and case file.
The trial of the two Americans unfolded in scattered hearings over the past six months. Two soldiers involved in the arrest testified that they searched the vehicle because the Americans were "acting nervously." The search, prosecutors said, turned up the two suitcases filled with a substance that later testing showed was marijuana. Prosecutors said it belonged to the two men.
Testimony from three Mexican witnesses at the scene -- people who said they didn't know the Americans -- contradicted the army's version of events.
Jose Antonio Bujanda, 21, told the court on Feb. 26 that he saw soldiers pull over Messrs. Huckabee and Quijas while he was washing windows of cars lined up to cross the bridge into Texas. He said he saw soldiers plant the suitcases in Mr. Huckabee's gray Dodge Ram.
"The two soldiers went to their own truck. I saw them take out two suitcases, then put them in the gray truck," he said.
Abraham Antero Torres, a 19-year-old candy seller, testified that he saw the same. "The military men that were behind took out two black traveler's suitcases and put them into the Ram, and that was it," he said.
A third witness, Fernando Monsivais, another window washer, told the court: "The soldiers put the suitcases in the truck, the young men's truck."
Mr. Bujanda was shot and killed in front of his home by an unknown assailant on July 2. Attempts to reach Messrs. Torres and Monsivais to comment were unsuccessful.
Alejandro Dominguez, a fingerprint expert hired by Mr. Huckabee's family, testified in March that the marijuana packages showed no signs of his fingerprints.
Court transcripts show a contradiction between when the Americans say they were arrested, at 6:40 p.m. on the road, and the official military account, which puts the time three hours later in a parking lot alongside the road. Under the military's timeline, the pair were arrested, taken to the base, then immediately taken to civil authorities, as Mexican law requires, leaving no time for lengthy interrogation.
A record of Mr. Huckabee's cellphone calls that evening, provided by his family, appears consistent with his account. The bill shows calls made throughout the day, ending at 6:38 p.m., minutes before he says he was arrested.
Mr. de la Rosa, the ombudsman of the state human-rights office in Ciudad Juarez, offers one theory about why the truck was stopped. A Mexican relative of Mr. Quijas whose name is similar, he says, is believed to be involved in the drug trade in town. Mr. de la Rosa speculates that the arrest may have been a case of mistaken identity. Mr. Quijas, who says he doesn't know his relative well, says that when he arrived at the jail, other inmates confused him with the relative.
Mr. de la Rosa says that if the soldiers confused Mr. Quijas with his relative, they wouldn't necessarily be inclined to turn him loose once they discovered his true identity. Winning a conviction, he says, would undermine potential complaints from the two men about abuse.
In its statement, the military said there was no confusion over the men's identities.
As they await a verdict, the two Americans share a cell with four other prisoners on the second floor of the Ciudad Juarez Center for Social Readaptation. The crowded facility houses some dangerous men. In June, three prison employees were shot by gang members.
Mr. Huckabee says defending himself in a foreign land hasn't been easy. A translator recruited for one hearing this spring, according to the transcript, said: "I don't speak English very well." The hearing continued.
Mr. Huckabee has been through five defense lawyers, none of whom speaks English. One lawyer who reviewed the case said recently he believed that crimes result from "demons entering the body and taking control, as Paul says in the Bible." One of his lawyers was shot and wounded in May, while exiting the prosecutor's offices.

Full text: Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared Friday -- for the umpteenth time -- that he's not running for the White House. Unless, of course, he thinks he could win.
As the inaugural speaker at Dartmouth College's "presidential lecture" series, Mr. Bloomberg discussed his White House ambitions, declared that he's downloaded the movie "Animal House" onto his iPad and joked that students not enter public service until they've first become billionaires.
As for his Oval Office dreams, Mr. Bloomberg insisted he currently has the "best political job in the world."
But he suggested the main reason he's not seeking the White House is because he can't get elected. His only supporters, he joked, are Diana Taylor, his longtime companion, and his 101-year-old mother, Charlotte.
"Every one of my positions cuts out half the country," Mr. Bloomberg, 68 years old, explained. "I'm pro-choice. I'm pro-gay rights. I'm pro-immigration. I'm against guns. I believe in Darwin. It's down to Diana, my mother and me left -- and I'm not sure about my mother."
Referring to his third term as mayor, which ends at 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31, 2013, he said: "There's not a chance that you could get elected, and I have a commitment to finish out this term.
"So, if drafted I won't run, unless I really thought you had a chance to win," he said.
The mayor then paused, waiting for the audience to erupt with laughter. It took the crowd a beat.
"Once again, you got to think guys," he said, chiding the crowd for failing to laugh more quickly. "Come on!"
But just in case any reporters thought he might have opened the door to a White House bid, the mayor issued his standard denial about whether he wants to run. "No. No is the answer," he insisted. "And if the press is in the back -- it's not true. I'm not running. Make that clear."
Mr. Bloomberg also took a friendly poke at his girlfriend, Ms. Taylor, a Dartmouth alumna who contemplated running for U.S. Senate this year.
"Diana tells me that this is a great party school. She said all she did was ski. I'm not sure I believe that. I think she probably did more than that -- drank a lot, probably smoked a lot, and all of that sort of stuff."
No word on Ms. Taylor's reaction to that public disclosure.

Authorities Charge 94
In Alleged Medicare Fraud
The Justice Department and other agencies charged 94 people across five states on Friday, accusing them of submitting a combined $251 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare, the largest takedown since the Medicare Fraud Strike Force began operating three years ago.
The government's multi-agency task force unveiled the charges related to separate schemes in Miami, Baton Rouge, La.; Brooklyn, N.Y.; Detroit and Houston, which included using a variety of medical services and fraud schemes that overcharged the government's health program in order for the defendants to pocket reimbursement money.
So far, the team has arrested 36 people. The arrested include doctors, health-care company owners, executives and clinic operators.

ENVIRONMENT
Scientists Estimate Impact
Of Temperature Change
If global temperatures rise, fueled by carbon-dioxide emissions, there will be long-term consequences in rainfall, crop production and wildfires, according to a report issued Friday by the National Research Council, a nonprofit that provides science-policy advice to the government.
Friday's report attempts to quantify the potential impact of temperature change on the environment.
Not all scientists agree that man-made emissions are fueling a warming of the climate, but many are concerned about what carbon-dioxide output now could mean into the future.
The report estimates that for every one degree increase in global temperature, rainfall would rise or fall 5% to 10%, in different regions, corn crops would be reduced by that same amount and the amount of area burned by wildfires will increase two to fourfold.

UTAH
Officials Say at Least Two
Are Behind Immigrant List
Utah officials said Friday they identified at least two state workers who apparently accessed confidential documents to create a list of 1,300 purported illegal immigrants that was mailed to law enforcement officials and the media.
Gov. Gary Herbert said the employees work for the Department of Workforce Services, which administers food-stamp programs and other public benefits. The employees have been placed on administrative leave.
The anonymous mailing demanded that those on the list be deported. The Utah attorney general's office also will investigate and decide whether to file charges.

TEXAS
Judge Gets to Keep Job
A judicial conduct panel issued a warning to Texas's top criminal judge, accused of turning away a death-row inmate's appeal. But the panel decided she wouldn't be removed. The State Commission of Judicial Conduct had been asked to consider punishment for Judge Sharon Keller after she said, "We close at 5"" while attorneys for a death-row inmate tried filing a late appeal. The commission found that Judge Keller's conduct on the day in question was "clearly inconsistent" with her duties as a judge of the Court of Criminal Appeals. Her attorney disagreed and said the judge planned to challenge that finding.

Abstract: The days-long kidnapping ordeal in May illustrates what authorities say is a growing trend as roaming gangs of well-organized, heavily armed gunmen turn their sights on illegal immigrants, making a treacherous journey ever more dangerous for people trekking north. The current situation resulted from a convergence of factors in the U.S. and Mexico that put increasing pressure on the traditional human smuggling groups in the area, according to authorities in both countries.

Full text: The bedraggled immigrants were picking their way through the boulders and scrub when a group of heavily armed men descended on them just short of the California-Mexico border. They corralled them in a cave and pointed their guns on the 10 men and one woman.
The lawless badlands in the hills east of Tijuana have long teemed with bandits and rapists, but these criminals demanded only phone numbers. They started calling the immigrants' loved ones in Pomona, San Diego and Bakersfield: Send us money or we'll shoot, they said.
The days-long kidnapping ordeal in May illustrates what authorities say is a growing trend as roaming gangs of well-organized, heavily armed gunmen turn their sights on illegal immigrants, making a treacherous journey ever more dangerous for people trekking north.
In the rash of kidnappings, which began about two years ago, gunmen hold people captive until family members in the U.S. send wire transfers of up to $5,000 to accounts in Mexico. Some immigrants are beaten; several have been killed, including a pair of brothers from Mexico City. Many straggle across the border and turn themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents. Others end up in migrant shelters in Tijuana, too frightened to report the cases to Mexican police.
Little was known about how the criminals operated until Mexican authorities dismantled two gangs in recent months, including the one involved in the May case, in which 11 suspects were arrested after a shootout and a wild foot chase through the hills.
The arrests provided authorities with a rare glimpse into criminal networks whose reach stretches from the border to cities across the U.S. and Mexico. The gang was allegedly run by a career criminal from the state of Nayarit and included a former Mexican army soldier. They admitted kidnapping more than 100 immigrants over 18 months, holding them in remote caves, makeshift camp and ranches.
"We threatened the families that if they didn't pay we would kill the immigrants," Jose Flores Romero, the alleged ringleader, said in his statement to detectives, referring to the abductions in May.
Authorities believe several gangs continue to operate. With a network of lookouts scattered at key points across 60 miles of rugged, isolated terrain, few immigrants slip by without the gangs' knowledge.
"They know all the trails leading to the border, from Tijuana to Tecate and the La Rumorosa" mountain range, said Fermin Gomez, a Baja California assistant attorney general. "They know exactly where they're going, how many are walking, and they're all intercepted."
The current situation resulted from a convergence of factors in the U.S. and Mexico that put increasing pressure on the traditional human smuggling groups in the area, according to authorities in both countries.
Organized-crime bosses in Tijuana, squeezed by a drug war, demanded higher payoffs, while U.S. authorities, adding fencing and staffing on the border, were making it more difficult to get immigrants through.
With a smuggling infrastructure already in place, it was easy and profitable for criminals to switch to kidnapping. Federal authorities in the U.S. immediately noticed the trend. Many immigrants began showing up at the border seeking medical attention instead of eluding agents.
"They're traumatized," said Robert C. Rodgers, a supervisor for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego, which investigates smuggling groups in the area. "They jump the fence into the U.S. looking for help."
The journeys start out straightforward enough. In Tijuana, recruiters scour fleabag motels that house immigrants waiting to cross the border. Offering safe passage, the recruiters transport the immigrants to staging areas in the ranch lands east of the city. Many of the recruiters and drivers are women who bring along their children to put the immigrants at ease.
At the staging areas, guides lead the migrants into the mountains on well-worn paths, into the hands of gunmen. "For the guides it's a win-win proposition: They don't have to cross the border, or risk being captured by the Border Patrol, and they still get paid," one Mexican federal agent said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the media.
One gang, arrested in April, would plant a member in the group of immigrants. When asked for a phone number, he would immediately provide it and be rewarded with good treatment. Other immigrants, seeking to avoid beatings, would do the same.
"You've saved yourself," the kidnapper told a gang member disguised as an immigrant, according to one victim in a videotaped interview with authorities that shielded his identity. "He acted like an immigrant, but we found out later that he wasn't. We realized that they had never hit him."
In the May kidnapping, 11 immigrants were walking through the hills off the Tecate-Tijuana toll road when they were confronted at gunpoint. They were stripped, tied up and watched over by several gunmen while their families were contacted and ordered to wire $2,000 to gang associates in Mexico.
A couple of days later, Mexican authorities stumbled upon the gang during a routine patrol. In the ensuing gun battle, a Tecate deputy police chief was wounded in the leg by AK-47 gunfire. The group was eventually captured and members led police to the alleged ringleader, Flores.
The highly publicized arrests have made immigrants aware of the dangers. Cupartin Sanchez, 27, interviewed at an immigrant shelter in Tijuana, said several smugglers had promised to get him across the border. He doesn't trust any of them, so he's going home to Guerrero.
"I'm not scared of the Border Patrol," Sanchez said, "but I am scared of the kidnappers."

Full text: The lawyer for a police officer who is challenging Arizona's new immigration law in court has asked a federal judge to merge his lawsuit with a challenge filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Stephen Montoya, the officer's attorney, told U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton in a court filing that the cases are virtually identical because they claim the state law is trumped by federal immigration law and because both seek to keep the state law from being enforced.
The law requires police, while enforcing other laws, to question a person's immigration status if officers have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally.

Abstract: There may well be thousands of immigrants, many from their far-flung former colonies, now living in British cities plotting destruction and unrest on a daily basis, but the English are not going to accept the possibility of having an American Indian lacrosse team on their hands as well. Time ran out on Friday for a team of Iroquois lacrosse players who have been blocked from traveling to a tournament in England because of a passport dispute.

Full text: As usual, it is about the papers again.
The men, mostly those white men -- also again, also as usual -- have official papers upon which they have written their rules and their laws and their treaties. They are very sorry, but it is all there on the papers.
The Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy have papers, too, but those are no good. It is a shame and everyone is very sorry, but those papers are meaningless. Please stop showing us your quaint, useless papers.
The Iroquois, who were among the inventors of the game of lacrosse, perhaps as far back as 1,000 years ago, were invited to compete for the fourth straight time in the quadrennial world championships, being held in Manchester, England.
The inclusion of the Iroquois Nationals is not merely a ceremonial nod to the past. The Nationals finished fourth in the three previous competitions and are, in fact, ranked fourth in the world.
Unfortunately, the passports from their sovereign nation, issued by Haudenosaunee, the native word for the Iroquois Confederacy, do not contain the proper radio-frequency identification chips. The passports, in fact, are just made of paper, if you can imagine that.
The Iroquois have apparently not kept up with the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative which went into effect last year. Travelers who wish to leave and reenter the United States and Canada must have the right kind of passports and security devices. As mentioned before, the Iroquois just have pieces of paper and those are no good.
The U.S. State Department punted this flaming political problem into the lap of the Department of Homeland Security, where it stayed for a few days, no doubt after having its shoes removed before being properly screened, wanded and patted down.
There is a great need for Homeland Security, of course, but that is not a concept that needs to be explained to American Indians. The Iroquois homeland once stretched across most of New York State and into Canada. The Oneida, Seneca, Mohawk, Cayuga and Onondaga tribes, along with others who formed the Iroquois nation, built their houses where they chose, and they hunted, farmed and fished where they pleased.
Sometime in the 17th century, a French missionary watched the Iroquois play a game of their own invention in which, 100 players to a side, on a field that could be miles long, the Indians passed a round object back and forth using forked sticks with weaving between the forks. The missionary wrote about what he saw and called the game "la crosse." As was the habit of Europeans, he didn't really care that much what the Iroquois called it.
Having waited long enough for the Homeland Security people to come back from lunch, the State Department and, more specifically, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, went into action. The Iroquois had a choice. They could take U.S. or Canadian passports, which would solve everything, or they could merely take a one-time waiver and promise to straighten out their worthless pieces of paper before the next world championships. The Iroquois were not particularly interested in becoming citizens of a country that systematically destroyed their way of life, so they went for what was behind Door No. 2 and took the waiver.
Well, that settled that, and the Iroquois were all set to travel, until the English cleared their throats and said, "Not bloody likely," or something of the sort.
The United Kingdom was not sufficiently assured that the United States would allow the Iroquois players, coaches and family members -- a traveling party of 43 -- to reenter the United States after the tournament ended. The English have pieces of paper, too, and they like to abide by them. There may well be thousands of immigrants, many from their far-flung former colonies, now living in British cities plotting destruction and unrest on a daily basis, but the English are not going to accept the possibility of having an American Indian lacrosse team on their hands as well.
That is how things stood on Thursday as play began in the world championships and the Iroquois Nationals forfeited their opening game in round-robin play.
Time ran out on Friday for a team of Iroquois lacrosse players who have been blocked from traveling to a tournament in England because of a passport dispute.
The 23 members of the Iroquois Nationals -- whose ancestors helped invent the sport as much as 1,000 years ago -- refuse to use U.S. or Canadian passports, and the United Kingdom won't recognize their passports issued by the Iroquois confederacy.
After a week of appeals to British officials, the answer was still "no." The team decided Friday to bow out of the tournament because there was no longer time to get to the games, manager Ansley Jemison said. The Nationals already missed their first scheduled game of the World Lacrosse Championships and were bumped to a lower division.
"There comes a time when we finally have to pull the plug," Jemison said.
The team had been camped out in a New York hotel in limbo this week, but Jemison said players will now be returning home.

Full text: ON a breezy, clear summer morning, Eddie Izzard -- the British actor, comedian, transvestite and aspiring politician -- took a trip to Ellis Island. He'd wanted to go ever since he first set a stiletto-heeled foot in this country in the 1990s, but never got around to it.
"I would have absolutely been one of those people who got on the boat to the New World," said the goateed Mr. Izzard, 48, who is starring on Broadway in David Mamet's "Race," and whose documentary about his life, "Believe," was just nominated for an Emmy. "And if they didn't let me in, I would have jumped overboard."
This time, Mr. Izzard, who is spending the summer in New York during his Broadway stint, was determined to see the centerpiece of American immigration, which is why he was on a late-morning ferry, slathering sunblock on his neck and savoring the skyline. He had traded his girlie wear for black jeans, boots, blue blazer and sunglasses, and wore only a hint of foundation on his face. Not that he looked like he'd just stepped out of the Nebraska cornfields; still, for the moment anyway, he might have been just another tourist taking iPhone shots of the Statue of Liberty.
"Funny that France gave that to the United States," he said, admiring the statue. "What did the U.S. give them in return?"
It was a good question. But then, most of Mr. Izzard's observations are dead-on. That is a large part of his acclaim; he's known for his political and historical humor, for his accents and mimicry, for leapfrogging from topic A to topic Q, for being, as John Cleese once anointed him, the "Lost Python."
He is also known for his social conscience (he has raised more than $400,000 for a British charity) and his athleticism. He is a marathon runner and is contemplating triathlons ("Animals in the wild are lean, and I think we should be, too").
He speaks and performs stand-up routines in German and French (he uses the A.T.M. in French "to keep my brain working) and is planning to learn Russian.
And his politics are passionate; earlier this year, Mr. Izzard, who is a Social Democrat, voraciously campaigned for the Labour Party across England, Scotland and Wales. He plans on running -- "standing," in British parlance -- for mayor of London or a seat in Parliament "sometime around 2020, if not bang-on."
Indeed, it's hard to imagine a more engaged visitor on the 27.5-acre island; he wanted to see and do everything. "We're here, we might as well," he said, slipping a headset over his ears. "Look at that," he said, reading a display. "Those in first class were allowed to walk right off the ship. Those in steerage were stopped. I never knew that."
He wandered up the stairs and into the Great Hall, the soccer-field-size room where new immigrants waited for admittance into the country. Mr. Izzard, who was born in Yemen and raised in Northern Ireland and England, moved from exhibit to exhibit, taking in everything: a gurney ("in England we call that a trailer"), a buttonhook used to inspect eyes for infections like trachoma.
He glanced at a manifest of impossible-to-pronounce last names. "This would be a funny bit," he said. He pantomimed an immigration officer holding a clipboard. "Here we are at Ellis Island. 'What's your name?' 'Smith.' 'What?' 'Smith.' 'Again?' 'Smith.' 'O.K.-- Yacjgdaw.' 'You?' 'Jones.' 'What?' 'Jones.' 'Wazinskawnsky.' It's the reversal."
Every so often a fan approached. "Aren't you that bloke who did all those marathons?" "I love you in 'The Riches'!" " 'Dress to Kill' is my favorite!"
Mr. Izzard was polite, asking their names, where they were from, posing for pictures. Still, he seemed slightly hesitant, as if he were embarrassed by the attention -- odd for a guy whose iPhone screen saver is a shot of himself in heavy makeup, a sparkly shirt and elbow-length black gloves.
When a reporter suggested his fans see him on Broadway, he demurred. "They only have a few days -- go see a big musical like 'Billy Elliot,' " he said. "If you have more time, see my show."
After a while, he abandoned the audio tour -- it was difficult to follow, the walkways weren't well marked -- and latched on to a group tour with Jesse Ponz, a park ranger. Mr. Ponz explained the history, pointing to the medical facilities where those who were refused admittance were kept, as he led his charges through the bowels of one building and into another. Mr. Izzard was rapt.
"Did people escape?" he asked, nodding toward New York Harbor.
"We've heard of that," Mr. Ponz said. "But the current was pretty strong."
"It's like Alcatraz," Mr. Izzard said. "People said you couldn't swim, but now they have an Alcatraz triathlon."
A woman piped up. Actually, she said, prisoners in Alcatraz were allowed to shower with hot water so they wouldn't acclimate to the cold water.
"Did you hear that?" Mr. Izzard said later. He was almost glowing. "You never know what you're going to learn. That group was exactly like the people who came over here. A mix of everybody."
At the end of the tour, Mr. Izzard thanked Mr. Ponz, who, as it happened, is a great fan. He offered to take Mr. Izzard around privately, and Mr. Izzard happily accepted. As they wandered around the museum, the two men debated the merits of disco versus punk, the War of 1812, Winston Churchill (Mr. Izzard, who is dyslexic, is listening to a Max Hastings Churchill biography), capitalism and immigration.
"I don't know what it's like in the U.S., but immigrants in the U.K. do the jobs the citizens won't do," Mr. Izzard said.
Five hours later, Mr. Izzard was heading back to Manhattan, with a little less than 120 minutes to spare before he had to be on stage.
"I do find history fascinating, I find people fascinating, and I'm quite good at standing somewhere and taking out all the new stuff and imagining people coming in," he said, looking at the city unfold before him. "And I would have been with them."

Full text: The largest immigrant detention center in the mid-Atlantic will soon open in Prince Edward County, an effort to accommodate Virginia's unprecedented surge in detentions of illegal immigrants picked up on criminal charges.
The $21 million, privately run center will house up to 584 immigrant detainees when it opens its doors. Over the next year, it might grow to hold 1,000 prisoners, most of them snagged by the federal government's growing Secure Communities program, which aims to find and deport criminal illegal immigrants.
Last month, Virginia became the second state, after Delaware, to implement the program statewide, requiring jails and prisons to screen prisoners by immigration status and check their fingerprints against the country's immigration database.
With three months left in the fiscal year, the number of illegal immigrants with criminal convictions detained in Virginia and the District has increased by 50 percent from last year's total, to 2,414. Those numbers are expected to increase now that the program is being implemented statewide.
The new facility "is mostly here to address the impact of Secure Communities," said Robert Helwig, assistant director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "We do anticipate a surge in detainees."
The immigration debate has grown increasingly polarized, and the Secure Communities program has become a symbol of that division. John T. Morton, head of ICE, calls it the agency's attempt to "secure the nation and protect public safety." But many immigrant advocates, including Enid Gonzalez, a lawyer at CASA of Maryland, say the program "claims to keep violent criminals off the streets, but instead it's just incarcerating innocent busboys."
There's one point on which experts across the spectrum agree: Without additional detention space, the program cannot function. ICE has detained fewer than one-quarter of the immigrants identified by Secure Communities, a range of suspected criminals facing charges as varied as misdemeanors and murder.
"The Obama administration can't expect to increase enforcement measures without increasing detention capacity," said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies.
Enter: the new Farmville center, an expansive, single-story building that fills a 30-acre clearing in the woods on the outskirts of the town, which is about 170 miles southwest of the District.
Richmond-based Immigration Centers of America built the detention center in the last days of the Bush administration, as the number of immigrants in federal custody hit an all-time high. ICA began work on it even before the government committed to sending detainees there. The town was, and still is, largely united in support of the detention center, which is expected to bring 300 jobs to the economically battered town of 7,500.
"They have to send these people somewhere," said Farmville Mayor Sydnor C. Newman Jr. "Thank God they chose Farmville." The town, which has lost manufacturing jobs in recent years, stands to receive about $213,000 a year in revenue from a $1-per-detainee daily fee the company will pay.
Before construction was completed, the project hit a snag: The death of an immigrant detainee at the nearby Piedmont Regional Jail stirred talk of ICE negligence, only two years after an internal investigation found that the jail's medical unit did not meet minimum ICE standards.
Edward Gordon, the jail's medical director and a Farmville council member, still pushed for the new ICE facility.
Another potential holdup was uncertainty about the new Obama administration's immigration policy. In his first days in office, President Obama closed one of the nation's largest immigrant detention centers, in Texas. Would there be a need for a mid-Atlantic hub for ICE operations?
The administration's large-scale expansion of Secure Communities soon answered that question. Since October 2008, the program has checked the legal status of 262,930 immigrants who had been charged with crimes in 95 jurisdictions.
In Virginia, most of those immigrants have been detained in local jails, not ICE facilities. The Farmville center is part of an effort to reduce dependence on outside facilities that house both citizens and illegal immigrants, Helwig said.
The new facility is also meant to relieve a tension between enforcement and detention that began in 2007, when Prince William County gave local police the ability to enforce immigration laws.
Like Secure Communities, that program produced a surge in the identification of illegal immigrants -- "more than ICE could handle," said Tom Guterbock, a University of Virginia professor who led a county-endorsed study of the initiative. After about a year, the crush of detainees in Prince William "forced ICE to say that they would only take the most serious offenders," Guterbock said.
Although the agency maintains that "Secure Communities is not restricted by bed space," as ICE spokesman Cori Bassett said, the recent spike in criminal detainees forced it to announce that the program will allocate limited bed space first to violent offenders.
"They say they're prioritizing dangerous criminals, but we continue to see people suspected of minor crimes who are caught in their net," said Gonzalez, the CASA of Maryland lawyer. "It doesn't matter if they're convicted or not."
In Farmville, Pamela R. DeCamp, managing attorney for the Virginia Legal Aid Society, is waiting for a deluge of new clients. The federal government, which provides funding to Legal Aid, won't let DeCamp represent illegal immigrants.
"But these people have families, and many of them have husbands, wives or children who are U.S. citizens," she said. "If they move to Farmville to be close to their loved one, there's a good chance they'll need our help."

Full text: FRANCE
Rioters burned cars, attacked a tramway and shot at police in the southeastern city of Grenoble on Friday night to protest the death of a local man fleeing police after allegedly holding up a casino.
The violence began about midnight and lasted through the night in the impoverished suburban neighborhood of Villeneuve, home to the alleged thief. No casualties were reported.
The riot in Grenoble recalled civil unrest that exploded across France in 2005 after two teenagers from a Paris suburb died as they were fleeing police.
The deaths touched off weeks of riots across the country, often in the rough suburbs that ring France's major cities. These high-rise neighborhoods, built in the 1950s and 1960s to house a growing population of industrial workers and immigrants, have become near-ghettos where unemployment is high and public services are poor.
Since then, unrest has flared often after clashes between residents and police.

AFGHANISTAN
Five NATO troops died in roadside bombings in Afghanistan, the alliance said Saturday, as international forces announced they had foiled an attack on an upcoming conference in Kabul.
Security is being tightened across the capital for Tuesday's conference, which is attracting the heads of NATO, the United Nations and top diplomats, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Acting on intelligence, a NATO and Afghan commando force captured a Taliban bombmaking expert Friday night in Kabul, NATO said.
Elsewhere, three coalition service members were killed by homemade bombs Saturday, including an American in eastern Afghanistan and a British soldier in the south. A third service member died Saturday in the south, but NATO did not disclose the nationality.
Two others -- a British marine and an American service member -- died in an explosion Friday in the south.

PAKISTAN
Men armed with assault rifles ambushed a convoy of civilian vehicles Saturday in northwestern Pakistan, the scene of extensive military operations targeting Islamist insurgents.
Sixteen people were killed in the attack in Char Khel village, in the troubled tribal region of Kurram, while en route to the main northwestern city of Peshawar.
Kurram has witnessed scores of such attacks, robberies and kidnappings for ransom in the past three years.
-- Associated Press
MIDDLE EAST
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he will resume direct peace talks if Israel accepts its 1967 frontier as a baseline for the borders of a Palestinian state and agrees to the deployment of an international force to guard them.
Abbas, who is under growing U.S. pressure to resume negotiations, met Saturday with President Obama's Mideast envoy, George J. Mitchell.
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has refused to be pinned down on a framework for negotiations, insisting on talks without conditions.

Now that's some vintage bubbly: Divers have discovered what might be the world's oldest drinkable champagne in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea, one of the finders said. They tasted the one bottle they have brought up so far before they even got back to shore. The bottles are thought to be from the 1780s and part of cargo destined for Russia.

Full text: Even before 2007, when the last attempt at comprehensive immigration reform was killed in the Senate, immigration restrictionists made "sealing" the U.S.-Mexican border a precondition for supporting legalization of the more than 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States. For a lot of Americans, this idea has been orthodoxy ever since.
Now, with immigration reform again on the table, President Obama has duly taken up the call for a stronger border. In his speech on immigration earlier this month, he lamented the "porous" and "broken" state of U.S. borders, and he described controlling them as an "obligation" and a "responsibility," arguing that the nation has "more boots on the ground near the Southwest border than at any time in our history."
More than 670 miles of border fences, walls, bollards and spikes that Congress decreed in 2006 at an estimated cost of $4 billion (plus future maintenance) are almost completed. The Border Patrol, which was increased from 9,000 agents in 2001 to 20,000 in 2009, costs an estimated $4 billion annually.
Throw in the cost of occasional deployments of the National Guard, as Obama has ordered again; the cost of electronic sensors, surveillance aircraft, training of local police; the cost of detaining, incarcerating and deporting illegal immigrants; and the countless other expenses associated with border security, and the bill runs us nearly $10 billion a year.
But will more boots really seal the border? Immigration reform has a long history of unintended consequences: More than two decades of increased enforcement since the passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 has done little to reduce the number of illegal immigrants. In fact, its seems to have increased their numbers. Meanwhile, the question of jobs, which are the true driver of legal and illegal immigration, has been largely neglected.
Princeton University sociologist Douglas Massey pointed out nearly a decade ago that measures to secure the border seemed to produce almost the opposite of what was intended. By making the northward crossing more dangerous and expensive, Massey and co-authors Jorge Durand and Nolan J. Malone wrote in 2002, the border buildup discouraged seasonal laborers from going back to Mexico when they were not working.
With increasing border enforcement, workers who used to shuttle between jobs in California or Texas and home in Zacatecas or Michoacan simply began to stay put and sent for their families, becoming permanent, if sometimes reluctant, residents. According to Massey, post-IRCA border enforcement may have increased the size of the permanent Mexican population in the United States by a factor of nearly four.
More unintended consequences: The anti-immigrant backlash that sparked Arizona's string of anti-immigration legislation -- the new law seeking to drive illegal immigrants out of the state most famously among them -- was produced in large part by tighter border controls in Texas and California. That enforcement squeezed the smuggling of immigrants and drugs into Arizona's Sonoran Desert and mountains.
As noted by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California among many others, the element missing from this picture is that immigration, both legal and illegal, is driven more by the economy than it is restrained by border enforcement.
That's not all that different from the immigration patterns of the past century and a half, when immigration levels were almost invariably trailing indicators of the U.S. economy and its sometimes severe worker shortages. One hundred fifty years ago, after the dislocations and slaughter of the Civil War, some states even sent agents to Europe to recruit workers. When times were good, we beckoned to immigrants; when they were bad, we tried to expel them. "We wanted workers," says Philip Martin, an immigration economist in California, "but we got people."
Americans have historically been ambivalent about new arrivals. Ever since colonial days, immigration and immigration restriction have been tightly wound around each other like a double helix. In the same polls in which Americans express support for Arizona's immigration legislation, they also say that by paying fines and back taxes (which most already pay) immigrants should have the right to be legalized. Some places accept, even welcome, illegal immigrants. Some try to expel them. My own state of California grants illegal immigrants relatively low in-state college tuition but denies them driver's licenses.
In the past three years, the U.S. population of illegal immigrants has declined, perhaps by as much as 10 percent, from about 12 million to 11 million. Anti-immigration groups such as the Center for Immigration Studies credit tougher border and workplace enforcement for much of that decline. But some, if not most, has almost certainly been driven by the recession, beginning in the construction industry and continuing in many other sectors that employ large numbers of immigrants. During those three years, more immigrants returned to Mexico than came north.
None of this means giving up on border control, especially if it's focused on drugs and other criminal activities. But if the objective is to reduce the attraction of U.S. jobs for undocumented workers -- about a third to half of whom, in any case, have overstayed their visas, not crossed the border illegally -- it requires different strategies.
In the past year, the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has conducted "silent raids" -- auditing farms and businesses to check employee records and then, using the threat of large fines, forcing them to fire illegal immigrants. But given the dependence of tens of thousands of employers on such workers -- about 60 percent of U.S. farm workers are believed to be undocumented -- it's hard to imagine that quiet raids will be enough to drive out many of those 11 million illegal immigrants.
Probably the most promising workplace strategy, which has hardly been tried, would be far more rigorous enforcement of labor laws on wages, hours and overtime, and of worker safety laws. That would sharply reduce employer incentives to hire and exploit illegal immigrants. In a small step in that direction this summer, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis moved to crack down on the employment of young children in agriculture. But that's barely a start.
For the long term, immigration scholars such as Robert Pastor of American University argue that in order to deter illegal immigration we should shift funding from ever-tighter border control to collaborative efforts to bolster Mexican infrastructure and economic development. He cites the economic aid the European Union provided to Spain and Portugal when it admitted those countries in 1986: This aid seems to have effectively reversed the flow of immigrants from those nations to the rest of Western Europe.
The best way to pursue such a strategy, Pastor argues, would be to create something he calls "the North American Community." This body, which would include Canada, the United States and Mexico, would manage a range of matters, from crime control, drugs and continental security to transportation, the environment and labor.
But for the millions who cross between the United States and Mexico every day to work, study and shop, and for those involved in thousands of joint commercial and cultural institutions, the border is already more a region than a line. Thus, in many ways what Pastor proposes via formal institutions already exists on the ground.
"Our two largest trading partners are not England and China," he pointed out in 2007, "but Canada and Mexico. The two largest sources of energy imports are not Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, but Canada and Mexico. . . . There are roughly 500 million legal crossings of both borders each year, and the preferred tourist destination of Canadians, Mexicans and Americans is their neighbors in North America."
Given the world's integrated economy, and the rapidly changing nature of, and constraints on, the nation-state -- think terrorism, or the flow of illegal drugs, or the regulation of multinational corporations, or the Internet, or pollution -- no wall, moat or border patrol will be large or wide or deep enough to fully stop the flow of immigrants.
Trying to tightly seal any border will almost inevitably bring unintended consequences -- in reluctant illegal residents, in increased offshoring of industry and jobs, in cross-border smuggling and crime or, as with Arizona's new immigration law, in a whole new set of foreign policy problems.
"Show me a 50-foot wall," Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said when she was governor of Arizona, "and I'll show you a 51-foot ladder."

Consultants offer special U.S. delivery; For many pregnant Chinese, American passport is strong lure

Abstract: At a time when China is prospering and the common perception of America here is of an empire in economic decline, the proliferation of U.S. baby services shows that for many Chinese, a U.S. passport nevertheless remains a powerful lure. The spokesman, who said expectant mothers typically claim they are going to the United States as tourists, compared the baby consultancies to services that help foreign students apply for American universities: If you have the money, they give you the service.

Full text: Correction: July 18 Page One article about a Shanghai consulting service that arranges for expectant mothers to deliver their babies in the United States misstated the price of the firm's basic service. The firm charges 100,000 yuan, which is about $14,750, not $1,475. (Published 7/21/2010)
What can $1,475 buy you in modern China? Not a Tiffany diamond or a mini-sedan, say Robert Zhou and Daisy Chao. But for that price, they guarantee you something more lasting, with unquestioned future benefits: a U.S. passport and citizenship for your new baby.
Zhou and Chao, a husband and wife from Taiwan who now live in Shanghai, run one of China's oldest and most successful consultancies helping well-heeled expectant Chinese mothers travel to the United States to give birth.
The couple's service, outlined in a PowerPoint presentation, includes connecting the expectant mothers with one of three Chinese-owned "baby care centers" in California. For the $1,475 basic fee, Zhou and Chao will arrange for a three-month stay in a center -- two months before the birth and a month after. A room with cable TV and a wireless Internet connection, plus three meals, starts at $35 a day. The doctors and staff all speak Chinese. There are shopping and sightseeing trips.
The mothers must pay their own airfare and are responsible for getting a U.S. visa, although Zhou and Chao will help them fill out the application form.
At a time when China is prospering and the common perception of America here is of an empire in economic decline, the proliferation of U.S. baby services shows that for many Chinese, a U.S. passport nevertheless remains a powerful lure. The United States is widely seen as more of a meritocracy than China, where getting into a good university or landing a high-paying job often depends on personal connections.
"They believe that with U.S. citizenship, their children can have a more fair competitive environment," Zhou said.
There are no solid figures, but dozens of firms advertise "birth tourism" packages online, many of them based in Shanghai, and Zhao said the number has soared in the past five years. But he said that many are fly-by-night operations, unlike his high-quality service.
"The customers we serve are very successful and very affluent," he said.
Zhou and Chao insist that everything they do is legal, noting that the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1868, says anyone born on U.S. soil has the right to citizenship.
"We don't encourage moms to break the law -- just to take advantage of it," Zhou said. "It's like jaywalking. The policeman might fine you, but it doesn't break the law."
"We are not snakeheads," he added, using the common term here for Chinese gangsters involved in smuggling illegal immigrants.
U.S. officials confirm that it is not a crime to travel to the United States to give birth so that the child can have U.S. citizenship. "You don't deny someone because you know they're going to the U.S. to have children," said a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Beijing, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing embassy rules.
The spokesman, who said expectant mothers typically claim they are going to the United States as tourists, compared the baby consultancies to services that help foreign students apply for American universities: "If you have the money, they give you the service. They tell you how to prepare your dossier."
"I'm sure people in Congress would call it a loophole," the spokesman said.
Many anti-immigration activists in the United States agree. Some argue that the 14th Amendment -- aimed at guaranteeing citizenship rights to freed black slaves -- was never meant to provide an instant passport to the children of people who are in the country illegally or who travel there expressly to gain U.S. citizenship for their child.
The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department have no specific regulations regarding pregnant foreign visitors, which critics see as an issue.
"The problem here is not with the travel agencies or even the women," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies. "The real problem is the State Department. The regulations do not permit them to turn pregnant women down."
Krikorian said that it is unclear whether or how the 14th Amendment could be changed and that in any event, Congress has never seriously addressed the possibility.
Zhou, a former marketing director, and Chao, a former television producer in Taiwan, said they have helped between 500 and 600 mothers give birth to American babies in the five years they have been in business. They started with themselves, when Chao went to the United States to give birth to daughter Fiona, now 4.
Now, they said, their clients include Chinese doctors, lawyers, business leaders, government officials, well-known media personalities -- most of whom do not want media attention and, Zhao said, would not agree to be interviewed.
About 40 percent of their clients come from Shanghai, 30 percent from Beijing and the rest from Guangzhou and elsewhere, including Taiwan. Some, the couple said, were giving birth to their second child to skirt China's one-child policy. Most say they do not intend to live in the United States themselves.
And all are affluent, Zhou and Chao said. Unlike the poor illegal immigrants from Central America who try to cross the border to have their babies in the United States, Zhou said, these Chinese parents fly in on first-class seats.
"They also do some shopping," he said, "so they are contributing to the economy."
The reasons they want U.S. passports for their babies are varied, but most come down to two key factors -- education and setting.
"The mainland [China] moms believe the U.S. has better educational resources," Zhou said. This year, 10 million students are battling for 6.6 million spots at Chinese universities and the chance for a better life. "The competition is too fierce on the mainland," Zhou said.
In their pitch to prospective clients, Zhou and Chao point out that as a U.S. citizen, a child has access to free public education from primary school through high school and that a full education in the United States can be much cheaper than at the top Chinese private schools and universities.
Education was one thing Christina Chuo had in mind when, late in her pregnancy, she and her husband decided to have their first child in the United States in January and turned to Zhou and Chao for assistance.
Chuo, 35, said that her brother and sister both studied in the United States and that "my parents paid a huge amount of money for their education" because they were foreign students. Giving her newborn U.S. citizenship, she said, would "provide one more choice for our baby."
Equally important was the setting. "It's spacious and with no pollution," Chuo said. "We thought it would put us in a good mood looking at the nice scenery, the hills and the water."
Chuo said she and her husband like living in Taiwan and are not interested in migrating to the United States, except, perhaps, when they retire. She said they got their visas by saying their purpose was tourism. But she worries it will not be so easy for others.
"I am afraid in the future, with more people going to U.S., it will be harder to get a visa," she said.

Full text: Colorado restricts illegal immigrants from receiving in-state tuition. Nebraska requires verification of immigration status to obtain public benefits. In Tennessee, knowingly presenting a false ID card to get a job is a misdemeanor.
Arizona's strict new law has generated the most controversy, but there are hundreds of immigration-related laws on the books across the country. The laws regulate employment, law enforcement, education, benefits and health care.
The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit this month to stop the Arizona law from taking effect July 29, saying immigration policy is a national responsibility and "a patchwork of state laws will only create more problems than it solves."
But according to experts, that is precisely what exists.
In fact, the number of immigration-related laws and resolutions enacted by states surged to 333 last year, up from 32 in 2005, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"Lawmakers are frustrated with the federal inaction," said the organization's Ann Morse. "Until the federal government acts, states will still see this as an area where they see the need to play a leadership role."
Already, legislators in five states -- South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Michigan -- have introduced bills similar to Arizona's SB 1070, which makes it a state crime to lack legal residency and requires police to determine the status of people they lawfully stop and suspect are in the country illegally, according to the organization.
As of last month, six resolutions had been passed in five states regarding SB 1070 -- four opposing it and two supporting it.
"I frankly understand the position Arizona finds itself in," said Virginia state Sen. John Watkins, a Republican. "We all live in elected republics. The pressure gets put on, especially in tough economic times."
States have a long history of enacting immigration laws. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, state lawmakers passed bills aimed at protecting national security.
"People were concerned about dangerous immigrants in their midst and they thought they should take matters into their own hands," said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute's office at New York University School of Law.
Not all the laws are anti-immigrant, said Suman Raghunathan of the Progressive States Network. Ten states have passed laws to allow undocumented college students to pay in-state tuition, and several states have expanded access to health benefits.
"There is an alternative way to look at this ... for legislators to realize the value of integrating and welcoming immigrants and immigrant families to their states," she said.
Washington state Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos, a Democrat, said the conflicting laws from state to state can create confusion. For example, a company may have offices in two states -- in one that requires employment verification and in one that doesn't.
"It is exactly those kinds of issues that need to be worked out at the federal level so that there is no question across the 50 states as to what the rules are," Santos said.

Arrests dip, body discoveries rise
Arrests of people trying to cross the border in Arizona's Pima County are down slightly this year.
But one grisly aspect of illegal border crossings is on the rise, border patrol spokesman Omar Candelaria said.
"We have found 142 dead persons in the last eight months," he said.

Full text: Â  2 Utah workers suspended
Accused of leaking info on alleged illegal immigrants
SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah officials Friday suspended two state government employees identified as the source of a widely circulated list containing personal information on some 1,300 purported illegal immigrants in the state.
Disclosure of the 29-page list last week sparked a furor within Utah's growing Hispanic community just days after the Obama administration sued neighboring Arizona over that state's strict immigration law.
A group calling itself Concerned Citizens of the United States circulated the document to media outlets and law enforcement agencies demanding that people named on the list be deported.
The roster contained the names, addresses, birth dates, pregnancy due dates and Social Security numbers of some of those listed, all of them with Hispanic surnames.
At a news conference Friday, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and other officials announced that two employees of the state Department of Workforce Services found to have been behind the list were placed on administrative leave pending the conclusion of an investigation into the matter.
"They're not heroes," Herbert said. "This act is something that I think is deplorable and unfortunate. It is counterproductive to what we need to be doing and talking about here in Utah."
The identities of the two and their positions in the Workforce Services agency were not revealed. But officials said others may be pinpointed as the investigation proceeds.
"I'm confident that this is a small, rogue group," Herbert said.
Kristen Cox, director of the Workforce Services agency, described the two suspended workers as people who "have strong political opinions and certainly have frustration around the issue of immigration."
"This is not about leadership or any broad-based conspiracy. It was a small group of angry individuals who quite frankly have some other personnel issues going on at the same time," Cox said.
Officials said results of the investigation into the incident would be turned over to the Utah attorney general's office for review and possible further action. Herbert said he would convene a public hearing on immigration.
Rah, rah, rupee!
Indian schoolchildren form the shape of the new symbol for the Indian rupee in Chennai on Friday, a day after India selected the symbol for its currency. India hopes to make it as globally recognized as signs for the dollar, the yen, the pound and the euro. The design was inspired by the letter "R" in the Roman alphabet and "Ra" from an ancient script used in Hindi.

Scientist on leave amid Rhodes probe claim
DURHAM, N.C. -- A well-regarded Duke cancer researcher has been placed on leave and at least temporarily denied access to a research grant while the university looks into whether he falsely claimed to be a Rhodes scholar on applications for federal funding.
A report in The Cancer Letter, a newsletter that covers cancer research issues, says Duke cancer genomics researcher Anil Potti claimed to have won the prestigious scholarship but did not.
"Duke is aware of the allegations raised in the article regarding Dr. Potti and has instituted a formal internal investigation," Duke spokesman Doug Stokke said Friday afternoon. "Dr. Potti has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation."
Potti is an associate professor in Duke's medicine department. He and his research colleagues have done work on the genetic patterns of lung cancer tumors and have brought in more than $1 million in federal money for Duke.
Potti could not be reached Friday.
Iran group gets review
WASHINGTON -- The State Department must review its designation of the People's Mujahedeen of Iran as a foreign terrorist organization, a U.S. appeals court ruled Friday.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the State Department failed to give the group a fair chance to overturn the listing.
The People's Mujahedeen filed a petition on July 15, 2008, saying it should no longer be listed as a terrorist group by the U.S.

5 killed in Pakistan convoy attack
PARACHINAR, Pakistan -- Suspected militants in a Pakistani tribal region on the Afghan border attacked a convoy of vehicles being escorted by security forces Saturday, killing five people and wounding several others, officials said.
Militants opened fire on the convoy as it headed to the main northwestern city of Peshawar from Parachinar, the main town of the Pashtun-dominated Kurram region where the army has killed nearly 100 militants in operations in the past few months.
"Five people have been killed in the attack on the convoy which was being escorted by our levies' forces to Peshawar, and several wounded are in critical condition," a senior government official, Naeemullah Jan, told Reuters.
Unconfirmed reports from the area put the death toll at 16.
Militants have gone on the offensive again after a recent lull in violence, challenging government assertions that a major assault in the South Waziristan had dealt a major blow to insurgents.
Muslims in Indonesia told: Pray to northwest
JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia's Muslims learned Friday they have been praying in the wrong direction, after the country's highest Islamic authority said its directive had people facing Africa.
Muslims have to face the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia during prayer and the Indonesian Ulema Council issued a March edict stipulating west was the correct direction in which to pray. "But it has been decided that actually the mosques are facing Somalia or Kenya, so we are now suggesting people shift the direction slightly to the northwest," said Cholil Ridwan, the council's head.
Castro keeps talking
HAVANA -- Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro took his warning of impending nuclear war to Cuba's Foreign Ministry on Friday, where he explained the reasons for his prediction in his fifth public appearance in 10 days.
Castro's sudden re-emergence after four years in seclusion for health reasons has raised questions about his intentions, but his message has been consistent -- a devastating war is at hand if the United States, in alliance with Israel, tries to enforce international sanctions against Iran for its nuclear activities.
"The United States finds itself now in an unsolvable dilemma (in the Middle East). It cannot get out, nor can it stay," Castro told 115 ambassadors.
THE NEWSMAKER
Arthur Williams, a 63-year-old career criminal, was identified as the "oxygen robber." He attempted an armed robbery in New York City and fled to Maryland, where he allegedly robbed two hotels at gunpoint, led police on a short chase and died when his car left the road and crashed, authorities said Friday. New York police said Williams tried to rob Sarar, an upscale clothing store in Manhattan, last Saturday evening while carrying a cane and wearing a nasal tube connected to an oxygen tank. He fired three shots before fleeing, police said. The next day, a Maryland state trooper pursued him in a chase that ended with Williams' car going off the road, police said.

Abstract: James Madison, in Federalist No. 10, argued that a large republic is better than a small one because the larger number of citizens results in so many competing interests that no small-minded faction can ever gain a permanent upper hand. In much of the world, ethnic and religious differences remain a recipe for violence, yet citizens of all races and religions live together in peace in modern day America.

Full text: Â  I am a new citizen of the United States. In the months preceding my naturalization ceremony, many people asked me, half-seriously, half-jokingly, "Are you sure you want to do this?"
They were alluding, of course, to the dire forecasts of impending American decline. Commentators speak of imperial overstretch, government overspending and a broken political culture. Allusions to the final days of the Roman Empire are commonplace.
My answer was "Absolutely. I am sure." And I am in good company, too.
In 2008, a record 1,046,539 new citizens took the naturalization oath. Evidently, not everyone buys into the gloom and doom.
Optimism is an imperative for the immigrant. After all, it is never easy to start from scratch in a new country. When I came to the United States as a student almost 10 years ago, I took a big chance. I only knew a handful of Americans. I had to take out significant loans to pay for tuition, and there was no clear or guaranteed career path ahead of me. Yet I vividly remember how free and confident I felt. I was defining myself in a new country full of opportunities.
The immigrant's sense of rebirth and adventure has always been at the heart of the American experience. America is a country of people on the move and on a mission. Many native-born Americans are "immigrants" in a sense, having moved from another part of the country to start a new life.
America was deliberately designed to be vast, dynamic and mobile.
James Madison, in Federalist No. 10, argued that a large republic is better than a small one because the larger number of citizens results in so many competing interests that no small-minded faction can ever gain a permanent upper hand. Abraham Lincoln resented parochial stasis and fought to preserve a vibrant Union with opportunities for the kind of self-driven upward mobility that he had experienced.
It may be fashionable to speak of decline these days, but it will take a lot more than our current problems to wreck a republic as strongly rooted in the ideas of Lincoln and Madison as the United States remains today.
American dynamism strengthens the fabric of society rather than weakening it. Breathing room for the individual fosters good citizenship and strong communities. Alexis de Tocqueville noted the difference between the vibrant associations in the young American republic and the near absence of public spiritedness created by the repressive old regime in France.
Even today, the social democracies of Europe struggle to integrate young and restless immigrants while communities all over America welcome newcomers. In much of the world, ethnic and religious differences remain a recipe for violence, yet citizens of all races and religions live together in peace in modern day America. The difference is individual opportunity.
One of the first things I noticed when I arrived in this country was how often Americans use the word "leadership." In America, anyone can aspire to be a leader. American society actively encourages and celebrates leadership at every level in business, public service and voluntary associations.
The United States is unique in this cultivation of individual leadership. Raw leadership material exists in every nation, but most other countries tend to suppress aspiring leaders instead of developing them. Totalitarian regimes are the most obvious examples, but even many democracies are marred by cultural traits that discourage leadership. Take, for instance, the "tall poppy syndrome" in many English-speaking countries or the "Jante Law" in Scandinavia -- social rules telling you to stay in your place and not stick your head up too far.
No wonder America continues to attract ambitious people from all over the world. Millions of people -- both native-born and new arrivals -- have their hopes and dreams invested in America. We will not let this country decline.

Full text: I roll into Ashland, Wis., just around quitting time and head straight to Deep Water Grille, a block off U.S. Highway 2, a stone's throw from Lake Superior. The restaurant also is home to South Shore Brewery, and at the end of the bar, having one of his own ales before heading home, is Bo Belanger, the brewmaster.
I join him for a pint and hear about what he has brewing. He's busy, as always, and plans are under way to find a larger space to keep up with the demand. His Nut Brown Ale alone could keep him in business, he says. As his beer goes farther afield via distributors, his ingredients, ironically, are becoming more local.
"All of the base malt used in South Shore's beers is grown right here in the Chequamegon Bay/Bayfield Peninsula area," he says, sipping a cold one. "Essentially we're paying the farmer to grow his own feed. I just borrow it for a moment for the sugars." The leftovers go back to the farmers as livestock feed.
I'm lucky to catch Belanger, but like many brewers, he often will take a few minutes to chat with his clientele about the nitty-gritty of brewing beer or maybe about the game that's on at the bar. A visit to a brewery -- what I like to call a pils-grimage -- can be an enlightening experience, especially in the case of a small-town affair. And though a pils-grimage can be made in any season, summer just seems the most appropriate. So pack your growler -- a refillable half-gallon glass jug, available at most brewpubs -- a cooler and maybe a tent and sleeping bag: It's road-trip time, and the destination is Wisconsin beer. Just be sure you don't combine your beer with the road. Either stay over or designate a driver.
Wisconsin's brewing history goes back even before 1848, when it was granted statehood. Though the German heritage is strong here, the first commercial brewer was John Phillips, a Welshman who started keeping the local miners sated at Mineral Point in 1835. An influx of Germans came into the state soon after, turning their newly settled farms into self-sufficient breweries.
From the many breweries rose the few big shots, such as Miller, Pabst and Schlitz, who gradually grew to push out smaller competitors. Then Prohibition left all breweries for dead or for soda production (Pabst actually made cheese for a while). After the dry days turned wet again, the competition resumed.
A few brewing giants swallowed up many of the small-town breweries until by about the mid-1970s, when only the big boys remained: Schlitz, G. Heileman, Pabst, Miller and a few determined midsize places such as Leinenkugel, Point and Huber (now Minhas).
Then in 1985 Randy Sprecher, a victim of Pabst downsizing, struck out on his own to create a new original brewery: Sprecher Brewing Co. in Glendale (sprecherbrewery.com). What soon followed was a trickle of so-called microbreweries that led to a statewide playground of brewers. I count 74. By the end of the year it likely will be 77.
Whether you are already in one corner or another of Wisconsin, or sneaking in for the weekend from across the border, Wisconsin's got a brewery near you.
Come up from Iowa and visit the Potosi Brewery along the Mississippi River. The original brewery for tiny-town Potosi opened in 1852 but closed its doors in 1972. A massive local effort and fundraising restored the old brick building, put in a nice restaurant and started up the brewing once again. Additionally, the National Brewery Museum, with several rooms full of classic antique brewer paraphernalia (known as breweriana) makes its home here, as does a visitor center for the Great River Road.
Minnesota's tap lines to Wisconsin include Potosi, but coming in from Duluth, the first brewpub is right across the bridge in Superior: The Thirsty Pagan. Located in an old creamery, the Pagan hosts live music and serves its own pizza and more. Fill up a growler here and go have a picnic at one of the nearby Amnicon or Pattison state parks, where waterfalls tumble on toward Lake Superior.
La Crosse still has the world's largest six-pack over at City Brewery (once upon a time it was the supersized G. Heileman Brewery) as well as Pearl Street Brewery, with its cool tasting room for sipping after a Saturday brewery tour or also just settling in for a cold one most weekday afternoons.
Michigan's Upper Peninsula is just over the border from Rail House in Marinette, a brewpub by the railroad tracks with 11 of its own brews on tap. The antique wood-back bar comes all the way from Bavaria. Drive a bit farther south to Green Bay and check out dueling brewpubs, Titletown and Hinterland, right across Dousman Road from each other near the Fox River. Better spend some time between these two.
And southern Wisconsin has the biggest selection. Milwaukee's suds community continues to grow, with 10 breweries, the most recent being Horny Goat Hideaway, and the Madison area's eight breweries (or more, depending on where you draw the line). The most recently addition is Vintage Brewing, which filled the empty spot created by the demise of J.T. Whitney's.
And hey, Chicago, watch for September's Great Lakes Brew Fest just up the road in Racine on Sept. 17 and 18.
Brewery tours aren't just for adults. Kids like to see how things are made, too, and many of the brewers make their own root beer or sodas. A good brewpub often is as much a family restaurant as any other eatery.
The wood-fired pizza at Red Eye Brewing in Wausau says "family," while the taps of superb brews by Kevin Eichelberger say "craft beer heaven." Afterward, stop at Bull Falls Brewery to find out how Red Bull went after it about its name similarity. To get the hat trick, dine and drink at the latest incarnation of the inveterate Great Dane Pub and Restaurant right off Interstate Highway 39.
Though you can find Spotted Cow just about everywhere in Wisconsin now, there is no substitute for stopping in at New Glarus Brewery's recently opened expansion overlooking the little Swiss-themed town. Purchase some beer before you leave Wisconsin because distribution stops at the state line.
Corner Pub in Reedsburg makes a great refreshment stop. The food's good, and a pint of brewer Pete Peterson's smoked porter shouldn't be missed.
German heritage isn't just a holdover from the 19th century. Robert Wilbur apprenticed in Bavaria before immigrating and settling down with his Wisconsin-born wife. Today he owns Das Bierhaus, a Bavarian-style beer hall in Menomonie, just steps from a branch campus of the University of Wisconsin. The campus is called Stout. You can't make this stuff up.
Turn your road trip into a boat trip. In Madison, head out on Lakes Mendota and Monona for public and private boat tours all summer and into October with Betty Lou Cruises. On Thursday nights, Middleton's Capital Brewery joins local pizzeria Ian's onboard a Lake Monona cruise for an all-you-can-eat-and-drink excursion. On Friday evenings you can sail Lake Mendota with live music and Capital beer.
On weekends, the Brew City Queen II tours the Milwaukee River, stopping at three breweries. Lakefront Brewery, Rock Bottom and the Milwaukee Ale House provide tastings and tours, and the cruise offers a bit of sightseeing and history in between.

Full text: Keeping people healthier
Your July 5 editorial "Mending Medicaid" challenged the state of Illinois to improve this vital program's efficiency and effectiveness. I want your readers to know that we are meeting that challenge, finding new ways to save money and cut costs while continuing to provide decent health care to more than 2 million children and adults in Illinois.
Through the Medicaid program, Illinois offers health coverage to families with very low incomes and people with significant disabilities, including mental illness. To help us meet our responsibilities to those in need, the federal government this year will provide about $9.2 billion in matching funds -- dollars that help support thousands of health care jobs throughout Illinois.
Without Medicaid, doctors, hospitals and nursing homes that provide care to the poor and uninsured would face even greater uncompensated costs, forcing private health-insurance premiums even higher and resulting in layoffs of doctors, nurses and other health care providers.
As your editorial noted, Gov. Pat Quinn recently signed into law three bills to help fight fraud and bring more transparency to Medicaid spending. We also have other major reforms already under way, including:
* Top-to-bottom review to tighten eligibility and enrollment procedures, to make sure everyone who receives Medicaid services meets all state and federal eligibility requirements.
* A pay-for-performance initiative for Medicaid providers, so reimbursement will reflect the quality of care they provide.
* Transitioning more people who need long-term nursing care from institutions to less costly home- and community-based programs, as recommended by Quinn's Taxpayer Action Board.
* Expanded Medicaid managed care for families in Chicago and Cook County.
* An innovative managed-care pilot program for seniors and disabled adults in the collar counties.
We also are working statewide to better coordinate all Medicaid health care services -- saving money by preventing unnecessary hospitalizations, emergency-room visits and tests that cost money without improving health.
In this era of national health care reform, our goal is to prove that Illinois' Medicaid program can cut costs while providing higher-quality care and keeping people healthier. We already have taken major steps toward this goal, and I believe we will succeed.
-- Julie Hamos, director, Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, Springfield
Judicial candidates
The Chicago Tribune's recent editorial ("A disaster delayed," Editorial, July 9) correctly sounds the alarm about the coming higher medical-malpractice premiums in Illinois as a result of the Illinois Supreme Court's decision to strike down the state's medical-malpractice reform law.
Premiums are stabilized right now, but as the editorial notes, "it's the calm before the storm." Medical-malpractice premiums will likely increase in response to more lawsuits and higher judgments and settlements.
Unfortunately a legislative solution seems out of reach for the foreseeable future.
But this does not mean we have to let the four justices who voted to strike down the medical-malpractice law have the last word. Three of the four justices who voted to strike down the medical-malpractice reform law are up for retention this November.
Good judges do matter.
A judge has the power to on the one hand provide protection for those who have been harmed and on the other hand dispose of frivolous lawsuits that clog our courts. Good judges strive to wield this power wisely, which is why we as citizens need to pay attention to the individuals we elect to serve on the bench.
The high-profile races for governor and the U.S. Senate will dominate the news cycle, but we as a citizens have the right and the responsibility to educate ourselves about the judicial candidates on our ballots.
-- Travis Akin, executive director, Illinois Lawsuit Abuse Watch, Marion, Ill.
Uncivilized behavior
The great ship called America is sinking.
Not because greedy mortgage lenders allowed people to buy homes they could not possibly afford, which caused the ship to hit an iceberg and break a hole into its side.
Not because illegal immigrants are not allowed to get into a lifeboat.
Not because elected politicians used money, graft and greed to be able to grab all the lifesaver vests.
The ship is angling down on one side, which is sinking lower by the minute, because that side is loaded with guns.
Many requirements were issued to those bringing guns aboard.
They had to get applications and register their guns.
The city had to process the permits.
All handguns had to be registered with the police department.
Fingerprints and background checks were to take place.
They had to get an owner's ID card, submit two pictures taken in the last 30 days, etc.
Is anybody laughing like I am?
The real facts of the matter are that, if those who want guns for murder, robberies, revenge or for gangs, etc., there is no way such culprits are going to bother with all those and many more issued requirements.
To me, the real question remains: When is the Supreme Court going to join the 21st century?
If it thinks that Americans must have the right to own guns to protect themselves, then "civilization" as we thought we knew it, does not exist.
-- Lillian Miller, Chicago
Presidents' practicality
This is regarding columnist Charles Krauthammer's "Obama is modest about U.S., not himself" (Commentary, July 12). While Krauthammer touts American exceptionalism, history has proved that similar views have led to triumph and tragedy. By challenging America, President John F. Kennedy did spearhead astronauts toward the moon, but he also stated in his grandiose inaugural address that America would "pay any price, bear any burden . . . to assure the survival and the success of liberty." The war in Vietnam ultimately proved that some burdens were too difficult to manage and some prices too high to pay. Likewise President Lyndon B. Johnson wanted to herald a Great Society that would rival and surpass the New Deal, cementing his historical legacy as the greatest reform president in American history. Unfortunately, fighting a war in Southeast Asia, while promoting an expensive program to end poverty in America, proved to be an illusion.
American presidents have an obligation to inspire Americans, to bring out as Abraham Lincoln said "the better angels of our nature." However, presidents, when acting as motivators-in-chief, must also temper their words, recognizing the limits of American power and influence by advancing programs and policies that are practical.
-- Larry Vigon, Chicago

Full text: Author: Rachel Pannett; Lyndal McFarland
Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard launched her election campaign over the weekend, as polls indicated a close vote and a tough test of the ruling Labor party's fortitude after a number of political setbacks.
Ms. Gillard on Saturday set an Aug. 21 election date as she seeks to take advantage of a rebound in the Labor party's popularity following the ouster in June of her predecessor, Kevin Rudd. But polls suggested the opposition has gained ground again in recent days while Labor continues to struggle with political baggage that includes a proposed tax on the resource industry, a retreat on climate-change legislation and a surge in asylum seekers from other countries.
A poll conducted by Galaxy Research for Australia's Nine television network showed Ms. Gillard's Labor party and the rival Liberal-National Coalition each with 50% when including all the votes the parties would win under Australia's preferred-voting system.
On a straight match up, or primary-vote basis--which counts only voters' first preferences and doesn't include votes redirected from smaller parties and independent candidates--Labor's rating dropped to 38% versus the opposition's 44%, Nine network said.
The results follow another Galaxy poll for News Ltd. newspapers from just before the election date was set showing Labor with a narrow 52% to 48% lead on a two-party preferred basis. News Ltd. is owned by News Corp., which also owns The Wall Street Journal.
Still, Ms. Gillard holds an edge in popularity over opposition leader Tony Abbott, despite taking office less than a month ago. The Nine poll showed respondents preferred Ms. Gillard as prime minister over Mr. Abbott by 44% to 35%.
Both Ms. Gillard and Mr. Abbott have said they expect a close, hard-fought five-week campaign. Earlier Sunday, Ms. Gillard described the campaign as being "on a knife's edge," while Mr. Abbott told SBS television that he believes his opposition coalition can win.
"This is a winnable election, but we are in a position from which we can improve," he said.
Labor currently has a 16-seat majority in the 150-seat lower House of Representatives, where governments are formed. The Liberal-National coalition may need to win as many as 17 seats to take office, based on electoral boundaries redrawn since the 2007 election.
Ms. Gillard kicked off her campaign holding babies in Brisbane, Queensland state, and during an address at a public-policy think tank stressed issues facing workaday Australians, such as long waiting times for health services, overcrowded public transport and long peak-hour commutes.
Mr. Abbott visited a home in Western Sydney where, over tea and scones, he discussed similar issues.
The campaign stops signal that the race will be more about who can win the hearts and minds of everyday Australians than about sweeping policy initiatives.
The ruling Labor Party has moved to neutralize issues where the conservative Liberal-National coalition enjoy an advantage among voters, moving toward more-populist stances on issues such as immigration and population growth. Both sides agree on some issues, including Australia's commitment to the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan and encouraging the economic relationship with China.
Ms. Gillard said her top priority upon becoming prime minister was to end the fight over plans for a new 40% tax on so-called super profits in the resources sector. The issue hurt the popularity of Mr. Rudd before he stepped down, as the industry criticized the proposal as damaging the economics of doing business in Australia. Ms. Gillard sought to placate furious mining-industry executives by reducing the headline-tax rate to 30% and limiting the new levy to coal and iron ore.
Mr. Abbott is determined to keep the issue on the agenda, warning that the tax will "choke the golden goose" by penalizing one of Australia's strongest export sectors, and vowing to scrap it if he wins power.
Clem Macintyre, head of the University of Adelaide's school of politics, said the changes Ms. Gillard pushed through on the tax proposal had at least taken the sting out of the debate. "It may not swing votes to Labor but it will ease concerns and minimize its importance as a divisive political issue," he said.
He said Ms. Gillard would seek to re-establish credibility on climate change after Labor postponed the implementation of a carbon-emissions trading plan, to the dismay of environmentalists.
Mr. Abbott rejects emissions trading outright, preferring measures such as carbon sinks and forestry plantations, which he says can deal with the problem at a fraction of the cost.
Another key difference between the two candidates is on asylum-seekers, where Mr. Abbott has adopted policies that proved popular for conservatives in the past, including holding "boat people"--many from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka--in offshore detention centers.
Mr. Macintyre said Ms. Gillard must find a balance between Labor's blue-collar supporters, who want tough action, and the party's progressives, who favor a softer approach. She has proposed processing asylum seekers outside Australia in a regional center, raising the idea with East Timor President Jose Ramos-Horta.

Full text: Poor France. On Tuesday, just in time for Bastille Day, the lower house of Parliament overwhelmingly passed a measure aimed at changing the offensive sartorial habits of 2,000 Muslim women who critics say are a threat to French values and identity.
The offending garments? The burka and the niqab, which cover the faces of a miniscule percentage of Muslim women in France (a quarter of whom are thought to have converted to Islam) and are at the center of a national debate over what it means to be French. President Nicolas Sarkozy, who championed the legislation, has said that such veils are "not welcome in France," and he characterized them as fundamentally incompatible with French values.
The legislation, expected be approved by the Senate in the fall, will subject violators to a $185 fine and/or a citizenship course for a first offense, but those found to be forcing women to veil themselves in public could face fines of up to $38,000 and a year in prison.
I'll start by saying that in this era of heightened globalization, every immigrant-receiving country has the right -- even the duty -- to reassess the boundaries of its culture, to carefully consider how newcomers should ideally be integrated into society. (I'm reminded of the U.S. urging the Mormons to drop the practice of polygamy so that Utah could be accepted into the Union.) But it seems to me that framing your national identity against -- and drawing a line in the sand over -- 2,000 women wearing veils, even ones as extreme as the burka, which covers even the eyes, or the niqab, which leaves a slit for the eyes, is a little pathetic.
I've seen women covered head to toe in Paris and in London. It's an unsettling sight. Certainly, the beliefs that encourage the hiding of women behind robes are incompatible with basic Western concepts of equality and human rights. But then again, so is the state's infringing on religious freedom or taking away a woman's right to choose what to wear.
Clearly, the French public, which news reports say supports the ban overwhelmingly, sees the face veil as deeply threatening and symbolic of more than an affront to women's rights. It is, in the words of French lawmaker Andre Gerin, the "tip [of] a black tide of fundamentalism."
Yet the trouble France is having incorporating its Muslim population, which is the largest in any European country, has little to do with religion. By most accounts, the angry young men throwing firebombs in Parisian suburbs in 2005 were driven by feelings of socioeconomic disaffection, not religious faith. In fact, according to a 2006 Pew Center poll of Muslim attitudes, France is the only major European country in which the majority of Muslims did not claim loyalty to religion before nation.
So what can the so-called burka ban gain France? Those who oppose it think it will mostly serve to foment generalized anti-Muslim sentiment. That explains why -- with some prominent exceptions -- French Muslims generally oppose the ban, as well as why it can only make successful integration all the more difficult in the long run. It's also not likely to have much of a liberating affect on the veil wearers themselves. Indeed, it may leave them even more isolated from society.
When you think about the ban in the context of liberte, egalite and fraternite, it's hard not to be more worried about the state than the veiled ladies. France is a discombobulated country -- according to one poll, 80% of French feel that their national identity is "weakening" -- and it appears to be willing to risk the integrity of its political values in an attempt to reinforce a culture it fears losing.
Last fall, Sarkozy led his country through a disastrous three-month dialogue on national identity. The town hall meetings tended to quickly devolve into racist ranting. In a televised New Year's address, Sarkozy was reduced to imploring his countrymen "to debate without tearing ourselves apart, without insulting each other, without losing unity."
And that's the problem. Wherever Westerners feel beleaguered and threatened by high immigration, they too often mistake disdain of others for pride in themselves, fear for love of country, xenophobia for patriotism. The French legislation may feel right for the moment, but it does nothing to solve the larger challenge of integration later.

Full text: Correction: Wednesday, July 28, 2010: Chinese immigrants: A story that ran July 19 in the LATExtra section about early Chinese immigrants to the U.S. noted that one individual, Jook Sue, who was traveling from Hong Kong, was granted permission to fly west. The story should have said that Sue was granted permission to fly to the West from Hong Kong.
The photograph that changed Charles Wong's life went on display Friday at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles. It is a small black-and-white portrait of a somber woman, a little boy in a new suit and a handsome youth on the cusp of manhood.
Wong found the family portrait -- his family portrait -- tucked in a suitcase, hidden in a closet, on the day his father, Gun Chown Wong, was buried. The woman in the photo was his mother, Jook Sue. The boy was Wong himself, 6 and scared. And the young man? He was the family secret.
In 1935, Gun Chown boarded the U.S. liner Coolidge and headed to Los Angeles via San Francisco, leaving his family behind in the Chinese village of Hoi-Seun. His first stop was Angel Island, the notorious immigration station in San Francisco Bay, which processed more than a million immigrants before closing in 1940.
By the time the Wong family could afford to reunite, Angel Island was history. So Jook Sue took her sons to Hong Kong. That was where the portrait was taken, where she was interviewed repeatedly by immigration officials, where she was finally granted permission to fly west.
Charles was allowed to go with his mother. But Liang, 18, was denied entry. Forced to stay behind, he eventually jumped to his death from a five-story building. His family never spoke of him again.
Until Wong found the portrait, "I didn't know I had a brother. I had suppressed his memory," he recalled, as he wandered the Chinese American Museum, where workers were busy installing an exhibit called "Remembering Angel Island."
"Our story is representative of Angel Island, of the possibility, of the difficulty and traumas that many others went through," said Wong, now 62, as he spoke of immigration's effect on his life, of his mother's depression, his father's silence, his own ongoing survivor's guilt. "It was not just our family."
The immigration station opened 100 years ago, and the exhibit highlights the stories of Angelenos who entered America through its doors. "Remembering Angel Island" is on view through May 29, 2011.
There are photos of the station's cramped quarters and dining halls, reproductions of poems that were etched on the walls by Chinese immigrants aching for home and fearing the future. The passport of 9-year-old Florence See is on display; a U.S. citizen, she was still detained and interrogated. See was the great-aunt of Los Angeles author Lisa See.
Actor Jack Ong created an installation in honor of his mother, Jeung Shee Ong, who fled Japanese troops in 1939 with five children in tow. She made it to Hong Kong, then sailed to America aboard the Coolidge only to languish for more than a month on Angel Island, according to the exhibit, "terrified of the ghosts of those who committed suicide in the barracks rather than face deportation back to China."
Angel Island is often described as the Ellis Island of the west. But Pauline Wong, executive director of the Chinese American Museum, is quick to point out that most immigrants processed in New York Harbor were quickly sent on their way, while those who came through the California facility were often held for weeks, months, even years.
Opened after the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act, it became the physical symbol of America's aggressive policies. Although immigrants from more than 80 countries spent time on the inhospitable island, Chinese immigrants arrived in greater numbers, were detained longer and deported more often than Europeans.
"The Angel Island experience is a very painful chapter in Chinese American history, a hidden chapter," said Eddie Wong, executive director of the Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation. Being held in the spartan barracks, repeatedly interrogated and subjected to invasive medical exams was an experience that "seared the psyche."
"For people like Tyrus Wong to speak out now," he said, "is a way of reconciling inner turmoil."
Artist Tyrus Wong, who is almost as old as the Angel Island Immigration Station itself, spent two weeks there alone as a young boy, a so-called paper son.
Because the exclusion act capped the Chinese population in America, very few new immigrants were allowed into the country. When the 1906 earthquake and fire destroyed the San Francisco Hall of Records, many Chinese immigrants claimed the identities of those whose paperwork was lost.
They became free to travel to China and bring back relatives or sell their documentation. Paper sons would study "coaching papers" with information about their stolen lives so they could pass detailed interrogations on Angel Island.
The coaching papers of Tyrus Wong's brother are on exhibit at the Chinese American Museum, and visitors can listen to a reenactment of his own interrogation.
His sojourn on Angel Island, he said, was a combination of terror and boredom: "I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. To me, it was just like jail."

Abstract: According to data compiled by his Creative Class research group, California has the highest Creativity Index in the United States.

Full text: To Californians weary of reports of government insolvency, soaring unemployment and foreclosure nightmares, economic development expert Richard Florida has a sunny forecast -- sort of.
According to data compiled by his Creative Class research group, California has the highest Creativity Index in the United States. This means the state has what the University of Toronto professor considers the prime ingredients for future growth: technology, talent and tolerance.
"Even though the whole state has been hit hard and you're in this terrible budget situation ... you have some economies that are proving resilient," says Florida, whose new book, "The Great Reset: How New Ways of Living and Working Drive Post-Crash Prosperity," picks up where his 2002 bestseller "The Rise of the Creative Class: And How It's Transforming Work, Leisure, Community, & Everyday Life" leaves off.
Florida has an admirable if somewhat quixotic tendency to make lemonade out of lemons. He chose the name for his new book, which deals with the economic crisis, because "reset" sounded better than "depression" or "recession." Tell that to an unemployed carpenter or photojournalist.
Expanded from a 2009 article in the Atlantic, "The Great Reset" compares what we're living through now to the Long Depression and the Great Depression, and his findings aren't encouraging.
"Today's Reset will affect our society at a deeper level than did the Resets of the past," writes Florida, who directs the Martin Prosperity Institute at Toronto's School of Management. "We are living through an even more powerful and fundamental economic shift, from an industrial system to an economy that is increasingly powered by knowledge, creativity, and ideas."
Florida urges financial and governmental systems to take radical steps to adjust to this new economy. That includes avoiding the impulse to salvage the very dead weights that are dragging us down: the automobile, home and financial-derivatives industries.
People too must fundamentally change their ways of living. That 20th century suburban dream of car and home ownership? Fuhgeddaboutit. Mobile and independent workers of the future will flit from job location to job location by high-speed train around "mega-regions" such as Southern California.
As for California -- a state that essentially defined the 20th century suburban dream -- the outlook is decidedly mixed, Florida says. Tech-driven San Jose is third out of about 350 regions nationwide on the Creativity Index, while industrial and agricultural regions such as Chico and Stockton linger in the bottom half. "What strikes me," he says, "is the range. You have three or four metros that perform near the top of the economic pile. And then a bunch that perform at the very bottom."
Of course, as goes the Golden State, so goes the country. The varying ranks of California urban areas on Florida's index correspond to the way the recent crash -- er, reset -- has affected Americans with and without higher education.
"The U.S. unemployment situation is another tale of two resets," says Florida. "Unemployment is ungodly high for blue-collar people and construction workers and more modest for people who work in professional jobs, technical jobs, creative jobs, or people who have a college degree."
The Reset thus proves the resiliency of what Florida has dubbed "the creative class," a group of brainiacs including not just artists and musicians but also knowledge, professional and technical workers -- what some might term the cultural elite.
As opposed to Richard Sennett, Matthew B. Crawford and other advocates, Florida sees little hope for the economic growth of American tradesmen. He's nonetheless a champion of the proletariat and has a broad understanding of creativity as a universal quality that should be nurtured in all. "Service jobs offer lots of potential for innovation, entrepreneurship, and the upgrading of employment opportunities," he writes.
Not surprisingly for a tenured academic, Florida places a strong emphasis on the importance of education. California's technology and entertainment industries and its residents' progressive pursuit of green lifestyles will pull the state out of its current quagmire, he thinks. But he's appalled by the way government is undermining one of its prime resources: the University of California system.
"This is just a great tragedy," Florida says. "It's the envy of the world, the greatest university system in the world. The colleges are the driver of the whole economy. It makes no sense. It's anti-Reset policy."
The only government move Florida sees as more inimical to the Great Reset is Arizona's clampdown on immigrants. Many crucial U.S. knowledge and tech workers are foreign-born, and Florida's research demonstrates that highly skilled labor needs lesser-skilled workers to support and sustain it.
"Arizona is doing the dumbest thing of all," he says. "Arizona sends out a message to the world that you're not welcome here. 'We don't want new and different people here.' It's tragic for Arizona and it's bad for us as a whole."
Tolerance is one of the three main factors in the Creativity Index. California's reputation for open-mindedness has taken a blow with the ban on gay marriage but not enough to knock the state off its top perch.
"There's something that happens in big, vibrant, economically diverse cities: metabolism," Florida says. "A city like Los Angeles is able to overcome problems because it's a fast place."

Full text: On a typical day, John Morton finds himself under assault from the political right for failing to crack down on illegal immigration and from the left for cracking down too aggressively.
And that's a good day.
Morton holds what might seem like one of the federal government's most thankless jobs: director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE. He is a key public face of Obama administration policy on a bitterly divisive issue, and the divide has only grown in the weeks since the Justice Department sued Arizona over the state's tough new immigration law.
If that law is allowed to take effect July 29, Morton and his agency will be even more in the center of the controversy: His agents will take most of the calls from Arizona authorities seeking to turn illegal immigrants over for deportation. Morton has already said they won't necessarily respond, drawing a rebuke from Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) on Fox News.
"I am not going to shut down immigration enforcement in the 49 other states of the union to commit to responding to every potential immigration violator in the state of Arizona,'' Morton reaffirmed in a recent interview in his Southwest D.C. office overlooking his native Northern Virginia. ICE, he said, has the resources to deport about 400,000 illegal immigrants a year nationwide -- and there are an estimated 460,000 in Arizona alone.
"We can't respond to each and every call," he said, adding that agents will focus primarily on immigrants with criminal records.
Morton, 43, is a boyish-looking former career federal prosecutor who took over ICE last year in May. Described by colleagues as earnest and apolitical, he said he is seeking a middle ground on the debate, enforcing immigration laws while calling for comprehensive reform in Congress and viewing legal immigration as "a good thing for our country.''
"You develop a thick skin in a job like this," said Morton, who admits to reading many of the brickbats that come his way but says they don't consume him. "I'd imagine that for some other senior leaders in government, the day when someone calls for their resignation would be the day they'd remember throughout their career. That's just part of the territory here.''
Sure enough, Morton and his agency evoke strong opinions from all sides. Crystal Williams, executive director of the pro-immigrant American Immigration Lawyers Association, faults him for overaggressive deportations and moving too slowly on promises to reform the immigrant detention system.
"If he's throwing people out without a lot of focus, he's hearing about it from the left, and that's what's going on here," she said. "If he's not doing enough enforcement, he'll hear about it from the right.''
Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), a persistent critic, accused Morton of "letting known illegal immigrants take American jobs and turning a blind eye to those who overstay visas or illegally cross our border.''
Similar criticisms are voiced by the American Federation of Government Employees Council 118, which represents about 7,000 ICE workers and recently cast a vote of no confidence in Morton's leadership. The union accuses Morton of abandoning ICE's "core mission" of enforcing immigration laws and focusing on "policies related to amnesty."
Morton's defenders are equally fervent. "We often say we are a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. John brings a great deal of sensitivity to both aspects of our identity," said Alejandro Mayorkas, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which, like ICE, is part of the Department of Homeland Security.
Doris Meissner, who worked with Morton when she was commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, known as the INS, in the 1990s, chalked up his difficulties to the growing pains of a young agency and "resistance to change" within it. She credited Morton for taking on detention reform and for trying to focus ICE on "serious and complex criminal investigations."
Though public perceptions of ICE are dominated by its enforcement of immigration laws, its agents also investigate terrorism, narcotics smuggling, child pornography and other criminal cases. ICE was the principal investigative agency for nearly half the intellectual property theft cases the Justice Department filed in 2009, federal figures show.
ICE was created by the 2002 merger of the immigration service and the U.S. Customs Service, which gives it the wide authority customs had to stop contraband from entering or leaving the country. Morton is trying to increase awareness of ICE's criminal investigative work, saying it is "poorly understood and poorly celebrated.''
Born in Scotland, Morton grew up in Loudoun County as the son of an American father and an immigrant mother -- a British citizen who still has her green card. His career track, after law school and a Peace Corps stint in Africa, was immigration-focused: He worked for INS, for a Justice Department team that ran INS, as a federal prosecutor in Alexandria and as a senior official in Justice's Criminal Division during the Bush administration.
In Alexandria, Morton prosecuted immigration-related terrorism cases after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, including against defendants who supplied the Sept. 11 hijackers with false Virginia identification.
"He was a leader, was frequently in my office with ideas,'' said Paul J. McNulty, U.S. attorney at the time. "He's not the kind of guy who just sits behind a desk and processes piles of papers.''

Full text: The union representing Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers is accusing the agency of unfairly targeting an agent investigators apparently suspect of leaking information about controversial arrest quotas to the media.
Officials with the American Federation of Government Employees National Council 118 said Friday that they suspect that the agent is being harassed because his surname is Asian, as is that of the reporter from The Washington Post who wrote about the quotas. The union declined to identify the agent.
In a story published in March, Post reporter Spencer S. Hsu and the Center for Investigative Reporting wrote about an e-mail that a senior ICE official sent to agents announcing new arrest quotas. ICE distanced itself from the e-mails and said it has since clarified its policy to agents.
"ICE leaders got caught doing something they shouldn't have been doing, and now they want revenge and are targeting their own employees," Council 118 President Chris Crane said Friday.
Crane said the agent, who does not want to be identified for fear of retribution, has been questioned about the matter by ICE's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR). The agent has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Crane said.
ICE spokesman Brian Hale said Friday that "senior leadership in ICE did not pursue or request any investigation into this matter." Hale declined to comment further on who might have asked OPR to investigate the leaks. He also declined to comment on the allegation that the agent was targeted because of his Asian surname.
OPR probes allegations of misconduct, but Crane said it unfairly targets rank-and-file workers.
Allegations of whistleblower retribution at ICE come amid a clampdown on leaks and exposure to the media across the Obama administration. The Defense Department is limiting media access to military officers after Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's comments to Rolling Stone magazine. It also charged an Army intelligence officer this month with leaking a controversial video of a U.S. airstrike in Iraq. Former National Security Agency official Thomas A. Drake was indicted in April on charges of leaking classified information to a Baltimore Sun reporter.
The Internal Revenue Service is facing criticism for not paying rewards to whistleblowers who come forward with information on tax-evasion schemes.
"Some of these prosecutions wouldn't have happened when [George W.] Bush was president, because there would have been a more partisan backlash," said Stephen M. Kohn, executive director of the National Whistleblowers Center. "The problem when you have a Democratic president -- it's not like Obama is signing the indictment, but it mutes the criticism."
Federal whistleblowers face greater risks because of a weak Office of Special Counsel (OSC), which lacks permanent leadership almost two years after Scott J. Bloch resigned, Kohn said. Bloch resigned in 2008 after years of misconduct investigations and is scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday on a misdemeanor charge of contempt of Congress.
Rep. Darrell Issa (Calif.), ranking Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Friday that the lack of stable leadership at the independent OSC is "weakening an important whistleblower protection."
Issa's comments were made in a letter sent Friday to President Obama about the lack of permanent leadership in at least 15 offices of inspector general.
The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

Full text: In the political marketplace, there's now a run on Obama shares. The left is disappointed with the president. Independents are abandoning him in droves. And the right is already dancing on his political grave, salivating about November when, his own press secretary admitted, Democrats might lose the House.
I have a warning for Republicans: Don't underestimate Barack Obama.
Consider what he has achieved. Obamacare alone makes his presidency historic. It has irrevocably changed one-sixth of the economy, put the country inexorably on the road to national health care and, as acknowledged by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus but few others, begun one of the most massive wealth redistributions in U.S. history.
Second, there is major financial reform, which passed Congress on Thursday. Economists argue whether it will prevent meltdowns and bailouts as promised. But there is no argument that it will give the government unprecedented power in the financial marketplace. Its 2,300 pages will create at least 243 new regulations that will affect not only, as many assume, the big banks but just about everyone including, as noted in one summary (The Wall Street Journal), "storefront check cashiers, city governments, small manufacturers, homebuyers and credit bureaus."
Third is the near $1 trillion stimulus, the largest spending bill in U.S. history. And that's not even counting nationalizing the student loan program, regulating carbon emissions by Environmental Protection Agency fiat, and still-fitful attempts to pass cap-and-trade through Congress.
But Obama's most far-reaching accomplishment is his structural alteration of the U.S. budget. The stimulus, the vast expansion of domestic spending, the creation of ruinous deficits as far as the eye can see are not easily reversed.
These are not mere temporary countercyclical measures. They are structural deficits because, as everyone from Obama on down admits, the real money is in entitlements, most specifically Medicare and Medicaid. But ObamaCare freezes these out as a source of debt reduction. ObamaCare's $500 billion in Medicare cuts and $600 billion in tax increases are siphoned away for a new entitlement -- and no longer available for deficit reduction.
The result? There just isn't enough to cut elsewhere to prevent national insolvency. That will require massive tax increases -- most likely a European-style value-added tax. Just as President Ronald Reagan cut taxes to starve the federal government and prevent massive growth in spending, Obama's wild spending -- and quarantining health-care costs from providing possible relief -- will necessitate huge tax increases.
The net effect of 18 months of Obamaism will be to undo much of Reaganism. Both presidencies were highly ideological, grandly ambitious and often underappreciated by their own side. In his early years, Reagan was bitterly attacked from his right. (Typical Washington Post headline: "For Reagan and the new right, the honeymoon is over" -- and that was six months into his presidency!) Obama is attacked from his left for insufficient zeal on gay rights, immigration reform, closing Guantanamo -- the list is long. The critics don't understand the big picture. Obama's transformational agenda is a play in two acts.
Act One is over. The stimulus, ObamaCare, financial reform have exhausted his first-term mandate. And the Democrats will pay the price for ideological overreaching by losing one or both houses, whether de facto or de jure. The rest of the term will be spent consolidating gains (writing the regulations, for example) and preparing for Act Two.
The next burst of ideological energy -- massive regulation of the energy economy, federalizing higher education and "comprehensive" immigration reform (i.e., amnesty) -- will require a second mandate, meaning re-election in 2012.
That's why there's so much tension between Obama and congressional Democrats. For Obama, 2010 matters little. If Democrats lose control of one or both houses, Obama will likely have an easier time in 2012, just as Bill Clinton used Newt Gingrich and the Republicans as his foil for his 1996 re-election campaign. Obama is down, but it's very early in the play. Like Reagan, he came here to do things. And he's done much in his first 500 days. What he has left to do he knows must await his next 500 days -- those that come after re-election.
2012 is the real prize. Obama sees far, farther than even his own partisans. Republicans underestimate him at their peril.

State legislatures move to combat human trafficking; Laws against forced labor get tougher, and victims get more help

Author: Savage, Michael W

Publication info: The Washington Post ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]19 July 2010: A.3.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/613629590?accountid=14496

Full text: A burst of activity among state legislatures to target human trafficking has ushered in dozens of laws to step up criminal penalties against traffickers and offer new help to victims.
The laws focus on practices that have remained largely hidden -- traffickers' coercion of victims into becoming prostitutes, forced laborers or domestic slaves. Some states have introduced measurers that criminalize human trafficking specifically for the first time. Advocates say the efforts signal that lawmakers are gaining a fuller appreciation of the scope of human trafficking.
So far this year, more than 40 bills have been enacted and roughly 350 introduced. That compares with just eight bills adopted across the country in 2006, according to the Polaris Project, an anti-trafficking group based in Washington.
Ann Morse, a director at the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), said bills tackling human trafficking are "the latest big trend." The efforts have followed coverage of high-profile cases and a growing grass-roots campaign among advocates.
The term "trafficking," said Bradley Myles, executive director of the Polaris Project, "makes people think of whips, chains, brute force and channel slavery." In reality, he said, traffickers may simply use threats or blackmail, or confiscate a victim's travel documents to gain control over them. Victims have included U.S. citizens forced into work without being moved across a border.
Washington state, which has been at the forefront of the issue, expanded its efforts this year amid fears that the Winter Olympics in nearby Vancouver, B.C., would be a major draw for traffickers. Among other things, new legislation ensured that hotline posters were displayed at rest stops throughout the state.
"We were the first state to start all of this," said state Sen. Jeanne Kohl-Welles (D), the sponsor of much of the state's anti-trafficking legislation. "We've strengthened the law every year." In 2009, she said, the state forced employers who bring in foreign workers to notify them of all labor laws and allow them to keep their travel documents.
Laws also were passed this year in Vermont and Oklahoma, among other states, and they take a range of approaches.
The D.C. Council passed a wide-ranging bill in June that criminalizes labor and sex trafficking. The law allows police to seize the assets of traffickers and includes more legal support for victims. A third party who benefits from trafficking can also be prosecuted. The new law also requires authorities to collect statistics to get a better understanding of the problem.
Virginia has set up a commission to look at sex and labor trafficking in the state, with a report expected by January. The state adopted legislation in March 2009 that allowed abduction charges against anyone who used force, intimidation or deception to compel another person to perform work. This year, a new Virginia law allows vehicles used for trafficking to be confiscated.
"I represent a large number of immigrants and learned more and more about the issue of trafficking," said Virginia Del. Adam P. Ebbin (D), who sponsored one of the new laws. "By putting the code in place, I'm hopeful we can now combat it."
One woman in Virginia said she had come to the United States from her native Angola to become a domestic worker because of the promise of medical treatment for a long-term illness. Once here, she found herself working as a housebound slave for as much as 20 hours a day. The medical attention she was promised never arrived. Her captors would not allow her to leave the house alone, even chaperoning her to the grocery store, she said. Unable to speak English, she was trapped.
A driver working for her employer told her she was not the first. He said "there were other women that were brought to work at the house, and they were all treated very badly, like slaves," said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear her captors would find her. "I don't know what happened to them."
The woman said she cried every day during her incarceration, sometimes searching the house for pills she could use to kill herself. Only a chance encounter with a woman at a store who spoke her native language, and the intervention of a church group, led to her rescue.
Given the volume of new legislation, the NCSL will formulate a policy statement on trafficking for the first time at its annual summit, to be held this month. The statement will allow the bipartisan group to work more closely with the federal government on the issue.
Trafficking, said Sheri Steisel, an attorney for the NCSL, "touches both foreign and U.S.-born citizens, and it's certainly an area that a lot of legislators have determined is a high-priority issue."
A significant rise in calls to the national human trafficking hotline, run by the Polaris Project since December 2007, suggests there is also a higher recognition of the problem among the public. "In the first month, we were getting around 300 or 400 calls," Myles said. "Now we're getting 900 to 1,000 a month."
Advocates said the next step is to translate the laws into convictions. So far, even in Washington, prosecutions remain relatively rare.
Statistics documenting the problem are vague and vary widely. The government estimates that 14,500 to 17,500 victims of trafficking are brought to the United States each year. A study funded by the Justice Department found that almost 250,000 children fall into a category of trafficking victims because they are at risk of sexual exploitation.
"The majority of the people who are implementing law enforcement and criminal justice responses across the country aren't necessarily trained to identify it," Myles said. "I think most estimates of this out there are underestimates."

Full text: We haven't heard much lately from the folks who say the Obama administration is making America vulnerable by trying terrorists in federal criminal courts instead of in military commissions.
It's probably because their rhetoric has been dealt a serious blow by the flurry of guilty pleas this year by high-profile terror suspects. They include:
* Faisal Shahzad, who pleaded guilty in June to attempting to blow up a bomb-laden SUV in Times Square in a plot supported by the Pakistani Taliban.
* David Headley, who admitted in March to helping plan the deadly 2008 attacks in Mumbai and to plotting to bomb a Danish newspaper.
* And Najibullah Zazi, who admitted in February to a suicide bomb plot aimed at New York's subways and supported by Al Qaeda.
All three pleaded guilty in federal courts, and all three now face maximum terms of life in federal prison -- where there is no possibility of parole. All three are also cooperating with authorities.
In another case, this month, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn unsealed an indictment charging five men in an Al Qaeda plot to attack targets in Britain and the United States, including the New York City subway system. It is believed the indictment was crafted, at least in part, with information supplied by Zazi and a co-defendant.
So much for the claim that our federal courts aren't up to the job.
These cases are not anomalies. They are the latest in a long line of successful terror indictments and prosecutions that underscore our federal criminal justice system's unparalleled ability to elicit intelligence, charge and prosecute terrorists and deliver substantial prison sentences.
Swift guilty pleas and cooperation are hardly the stuff of a weak justice system. And it's important to note that cooperation happens often in federal criminal prosecutions, but not in military commissions. Terrorist conviction statistics, provided by the Justice Department's National Security Division, are impressive:
* By mid-March of this year, 403 terrorism suspects had been tried and convicted in federal district courts since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
* Of these, 159 were convicted of Category I crimes -- violations of federal statutes directly related to international terrorism.
* The other 244 were convicted of Category II crimes -- violations of fraud, immigration, firearms, drugs and other statutes in cases with identified links to international terrorism.
A dozen of these convicted terrorists were sentenced to life in prison. One was sentenced to 155 years, and 18 others received sentences of 20 years or more.
The average sentence handed down to defendants charged with terrorism, between 2001 and 2009, is 19.7 years, according to the Center on Law and Security at New York University's School of Law.
And the most dangerous have been jailed in the highest-security facilities operated by the Bureau of Prisons. This includes roughly three dozen terrorists, many with ties to Al Qaeda, incarcerated at the "Supermax" prison near Florence, Colo.
How have military commissions done by comparison?
Since 9/11, only four Guantanamo detainees have been prosecuted in military commissions. Two of them received light sentences and are now free.
That's not to say that there may be instances in which a military commission might be a superior venue, such as cases involving attacks aimed at U.S. military facilities.
But results matter. And the lopsided statistics clearly show that military commissions should be the exception, not the rule.
In any event, the decision of the best venue in which to prosecute a terror suspect should be the president's to make, and the call should be made based on facts, not political rhetoric.
Our federal courts have an unmatched record of putting terror suspects on trial, collecting intelligence when possible -- and sending them away for good.

In addition to the deployment of National Guard troops, about 300 Customs and Border Protection agents and officers will be sent to the border region along with additional helicopters and other surveillance equipment, they said.
The administration has pledged to send up to 1,200 National Guard troops to the area for a year and to seek $600 million for, among other things, 1,000 new Border Patrol agents and unmanned aerial detection systems.
The largest share of the National Guard force -- 524 troops -- will go to Arizona, where state officials have complained about lack of security.

Full text: Federal agents have arrested 105 people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in a crackdown on foreign-born gang members, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said.
In a five-day operation that ended Saturday, the agency said, it arrested 67 gang members and five known local gang associates. Seventy-two were arrested on criminal warrants or charges, and 33 were arrested on immigration violations, the agency said. Of those arrested, 57 are from Mexico, 42 are U.S. citizens, four are from El Salvador, and two are from Honduras, the agency said.
Two firearms, U.S. currency, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine and hydrocodone were also seized, the agency said.
"Gangs are responsible for a significant amount of crime throughout" the area, said federal agent John Chakwin.

Full text: GREAT LAKES
Five States Sue U.S.
Over Asian Carp Threat
Despite being rebuffed twice by the U.S. Supreme Court, five states filed suit Monday with a lower federal court demanding tougher federal and municipal action to prevent Asian carp from overrunning the Great Lakes and decimating their fishing industry.
Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota and Pennsylvania said in their complaint the situation had become more dire since a live bighead carp was found last month in a Chicago-area waterway only six miles from Lake Michigan -- well past an electric barrier designed to block the voracious fish's path.
"Asian carp will kill jobs and ruin our way of life," Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox said in a statement. "We cannot afford more bureaucratic delays -- every action must be taken to protect the Great Lakes."
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in northern Illinois. It accuses the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago of creating a public nuisance by operating locks, gates and other infrastructure through which the carp could enter the lakes.
The Justice Department, which represents the Army Corps, is reviewing the suit and will file a response later, a spokesman said.

UTAH
Eight More Investigated
In Immigrant List Probe
Utah officials are investigating whether eight more state workers may have accessed confidential documents to create a list of 1,300 purported illegal immigrants that was mailed to law enforcement officials and the news media.
A Department of Workforce Services spokesman said the employees were being interviewed Monday. Two other state workers were placed on administrative leave with pay last week.
The department administers food stamp programs and other benefits. State officials have said most of those identified on the list have children who are receiving benefits.
The list that was mailed contains Social Security numbers, birth dates, workplaces, addresses and phone numbers. Names of children are included, along with due dates of pregnant women.

Everglades Preservation
To Cost $89 Million
The federal government will spend $89 million to preserve almost 26,000 acres of wild ranch in a northern swath of the Florida Everglades in the biggest expenditures of its kind, officials said Monday.
Under the plan, the federal government will acquire the right to protect wetlands in the Fisheating Creek watershed located in Florida's rural Highlands County, although the four ranching families who own the properties will keep title to the land.
The outlay represents a quarter of what the federal government will spend this year as part of its Wetlands Reserve Program. It also is one of the largest contiguous easement purchases in the history of the program.
The entire Everglades once covered more than 6,250 square miles but has shrunk by half, replaced with homes and farms and a 2,000-mile grid of drainage canals.

NEW YORK
Judge Says State Can Try
To Detain Sex Offender
New York can continue its efforts to keep a sex offender who infected at least 13 women with the AIDS virus locked up beyond the 12-year prison sentence he completed in April.
A state Supreme Court judge in Buffalo refused a request by Nushawn Williams' lawyer to throw out the attorney general's case to have Mr. Williams held indefinitely under a civil-confinement law.
Defense attorney Daniel Grasso had argued that Mr. Williams isn't subject to that three-year-old law because it was passed after he had finished a sentence for statutory rape and while he was serving time for reckless endangerment.
But the judge agreed Monday with the state that sentences merge together in prison.
Mr. Williams' civil-confinement trial is set for October.

RHODE ISLAND
Ex-Judge Takes Charge
Of Struggling Central Falls
Rhode Island's first state-appointed receiver wasted little time in trying to help the distressed city of Central Falls get its finances in order.
The receiver, retired judge Mark Pfeiffer, fired the city's personnel director on Monday, his first full day on the job, and cut the mayor's compensation to $1,000 every other week. The mayor has been reduced to an advisory role and has to give up perks such as cellphones. The receiver, whose powers supersede those of elected officials, will be tackling a $9 million budget deficit, equal to half the budget for the city of 47,000.

Three Accused of Piracy
Claim Harsh Treatment
Three Somali men being prosecuted on U.S. piracy charges say they were held naked, blindfolded and handcuffed for days without an interpreter, while another says an interpreter threatened to toss him overboard, attorneys argued in court papers Monday.
Attorneys representing the Somalis also claim charges against one of the defendants should be dismissed because he is a juvenile.
In the case of two defendants, attorneys said statements the men made shouldn't be allowed in court because they weren't advised of their Miranda rights to remain silent and have an attorney.
The motions filed electronically Monday were among several submitted in U.S. District Court in Norfolk, where five Somalis are being prosecuted for the alleged April 1 attack on the USS Nicholas off the coast of Africa.

WASHINGTON, D.C.
National Guard to Deploy
Along U.S.-Mexican Border
National Guard troops will head to the U.S.-Mexico border Aug. 1 for a yearlong deployment to keep a lookout for illegal border crossers and smugglers and help in criminal investigations, federal officials said Monday.
The 1,200 troops will be armed but can use their weapons only to protect themselves, Gen. Craig McKinley, chief of the National Guard Bureau, told a Pentagon news conference. The troops will undergo initial training and be deployed fully along the nearly 2,000-mile border by September.

Abstract: While the performance-management systems your agencies use can provide a starting point for structuring feedback, I often hear they aren't enough to prepare you for the complete conversation. To gain a well-rounded understanding of an employee's performance and uncover the root causes of performance issues, take the time to review previous appraisals and to collect feedback from people who work with the employee, as appropriate.

Full text: The nonprofit Partnership for Public Service and The Washington Post's On Leadership site jointly produce the Federal Coach, hosted by Tom Fox, director of the partnership's Center for Government Leadership.
The goal is to "engage, inspire and learn from you, the federal worker, whether you are a new hire, a contractor or a manager at the highest level."
For many people, top fears include spiders, heights, public speaking and crowds. For many government managers I speak to, it's delivering criticism at performance time.
It's no wonder that delivering feedback -- particularly feedback on improving -- produces so much anxiety. Even under the best of circumstances, delivering feedback and coaching is difficult. But when an employee is not performing to expectations, emotions often run high. The performance conversation is the scenario that makes even experienced managers sweat. No one wants to be the bad guy.
While the performance-management systems your agencies use can provide a starting point for structuring feedback, I often hear they aren't enough to prepare you for the complete conversation. I tell managers that their key goal is not to provide a litany on all the ways their employees failed but rather the goal is to provide them with a list of ways to improve.
Here are some ideas for delivering effective, constructive feedback on how to improve:
1. Prepare for the best and the worst. As a general rule, supervisors should spend at least twice the amount of time preparing to deliver feedback as they actually spend delivering the feedback. To gain a well-rounded understanding of an employee's performance and uncover the root causes of performance issues, take the time to review previous appraisals and to collect feedback from people who work with the employee, as appropriate. Write down the points you want to make so you can be as clear as possible, and select your words carefully.
2. Ask for their assessment. When it comes time to deliver feedback, listen first and talk later. Start by asking your employee some key questions before going into your list of performance themes such as: How have you been doing? What do you consider your greatest achievements this year? What do you wish you had done better? Which aspects of the job are you still learning? Consider asking for a written assessment in advance of the meeting.
3. Diagnose key performance themes. When preparing and delivering feedback, you should consider the strengths and weaknesses of an employee and communicate both. When you're identifying issues, be certain to find descriptive, results-oriented examples to highlight a broader theme. Begin with positives, move to areas for improvement and close on a positive point. The goal, after all, is to motivate your poor performer to improve.
4. Always consider the human element. Have a box of tissues on hand and understand that emotions might overtake the moment, and that's okay. Offer the tissues if needed, be empathetic, but keep providing your feedback.
5. Work together to define next steps. To help your team process the feedback and focus on improving, be prepared to have an open dialogue about the best ways you can work together to help them. Whatever the conversation, you should be ready to outline a set of specific, measurable, action-oriented, realistic and time-bound goals for getting better.
Recognizing how difficult performance feedback and coaching can be, I'm sure you have ideas to add to this starting point.
How would you advise others to deliver critical feedback? Leave a comment or send ideas to fedcoach@ourpublicservice.org.

National Guard troops will head to the U.S.-Mexico border Aug. 1 on a year-long deployment to keep a lookout for illegal border crossers and smugglers and assist criminal investigations, federal officials said Monday.
The troops will be armed but can use their weapons only to protect themselves, said Gen. Craig McKinley, chief of the National Guard Bureau. The troops will undergo initial training and be fully deployed along the nearly 2,000-mile southern border by September.
The deployment announcement comes as drug-related violence escalates in Mexico. Several people were killed over the weekend in a car bombing and in a separate massacre at a private party in Mexico. It also comes as the U.S. debate over illegal immigration has intensified in this election year.
The 1,200 troops will be distributed among four border states, with Arizona getting 524; Texas, 250; California, 224; and New Mexico, 72. An additional 130 would be assigned to a national liaison office. More can be deployed at state cost, he said.

New York can try to keep a sex offender locked up beyond the 12-year prison sentence he completed in April, a judge ruled Monday.
Prosecutors can use the state's civil-confinement law, meant to keep the most dangerous sex offenders out of communities after prison, to try to detain Nushawn Williams indefinitely, State Supreme Court Justice John Michalski said. Williams infected at least 13 women with HIV before pleading guilty in 1998 to statutory rape and reckless endangerment.
Williams is scheduled to face a civil-confinement trial in October.
Defense attorney Daniel Grasso had argued in June that Williams should not be subject to the civil-confinement law because it was passed in 2007, long after his guilty plea. He also said Williams had already finished the rape sentence at the time and had begun serving his consecutive sentence for reckless endangerment, a crime not eligible for civil confinement. But Michalski ruled that sentences merge together in prison, so Williams was still in prison for a sex crime when the law was passed.

Judge extends action against Okla. abortion law: An Oklahoma judge granted an injunction Monday blocking enforcement of a state law that would require women seeking abortions to have an ultrasound and listen to a detailed description of the fetus. Oklahoma County District Judge Noma Gurich set a pretrial hearing for Jan. 21 and directed that the state not enforce the law, which was passed by legislators this year. A temporary restraining order against the law had been in effect since May.

A Fairfax County man was fatally shot Sunday night on a street in downtown Oakland, Calif., where he had traveled for a job interview with Google, Oakland police said Monday.
Jinghong Kang, 45, was a computer engineer who lived in the Fair Oaks area of Fairfax with his wife and three children, police said. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that he was in his rental car, entering directions to his hotel into his GPS system, when two men approached him. The men demanded money, then one shot Kang while he sat in the car, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

Immigration authorities have arrested 30 alleged gang members and associates in Northern Virginia, all but one of them foreign nationals, and charged them with an array of crimes, including entering the United States illegally, federal officials said.
The three-day operation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents targeted members and associates of such Latino gangs as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), Mexican Pride and Southside Locos, the agency said in a statement. One of the arrestees is a U.S. citizen, and the others are from El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico.
Charges include assault, grand larceny, destruction of property, carrying a concealed weapon and reentering the county illegally after being deported, authorities said. They said the 29 foreign nationals will face deportation proceedings in the near future or after they have been prosecuted on the criminal charges against them.
The immigration agency said it was assisted in the operation by Fairfax County police officers and sheriff's deputies.

Full text: U.N.: Lebanon force is active
Peacekeepers not shirking mandate, spokesman says
BEIRUT -- In the wake of violent confrontations in southern Lebanon in recent weeks, the spokesman for U.N. troops on Monday rejected accusations that peacekeepers were stepping timidly for fear of provoking Hezbollah's Shiite militia.
Clashes between troops and villagers have sparked a debate about the role of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in the south.
But U.N. peacekeepers have not reduced their footprint in the south, conducting 350 to 400 patrols daily just as before, said Neeraj Singh, the international force's spokesman.
"There's a lack of understanding about UNIFIL's role here," Singh said. "A lot of things attributed to UNIFIL as being active or inactive are actually outside the mandate. It's the primary responsibility of the Lebanese army to make sure there are no weapons between the Litani River and the Israeli border."
According to Singh, Shiite villagers confronted the UNIFIL troops in a minor incident June 29 and then more seriously July 3, when they used stones to pelt French soldiers conducting a patrol about five miles from Israel, and dragged one soldier away, injuring him. The residents feared that the UNIFIL exercise signaled impending raids on their homes, he said.
Lebanon recently said it would move up to 5,000 more troops to the south. Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon until 2000, has accused the peacekeeping force of simply providing international cover that masks Hezbollah's efforts to rearm.
Singh, however, said UNIFIL had found no evidence of weapons smuggling to the south since the 2006 war.
Meanwhile, Israeli officials said a system that shoots down short-range rockets passed final tests Monday and will be deployed by November.
President Barack Obama in May asked Congress for $205 million to support the development of "Iron Dome."

Aftermath of Indian rail disaster
SAINTHIA, India -- Onlookers crowd the site of a train accident in the eastern state of West Bengal on Monday after a speeding passenger train crashed into another that was waiting at a station, killing at least 60 people. It was India's second major rail accident in as many months. In late May, a passenger train derailed and collided with a cargo train, killing 145 people, in a crash authorities said was an act of sabotage by Maoist rebels.

Intelligence chief rebuts charges of bloat, waste
WASHINGTON -- The nation's top intelligence official sought Monday to rebut a Washington Post series charging that intelligence agencies have become bloated and inefficient, insisting they "are achieving untold successes every day."
David Gompert, acting director of national intelligence, said in a statement the agencies strive to be efficient, but that some overlap is by design.
"We work constantly to reduce inefficiencies and redundancies, while preserving a degree of ... overlap among agencies to strengthen analysis, challenge conventional thinking and eliminate single points of failure," he said.
The Post's series, which began Monday, said that the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks set off an explosion in the growth of the counterterrorism bureaucracy. Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies are now part of a sprawling secret network of agencies that lacks thorough oversight.
U.S. targets Texas gangs
A five-day operation focusing on foreign-born gang members resulted in the arrests of 105 people in Texas, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said Monday.
Of those arrested during the operation, which targeted people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area allegedly involved in organized crime, 67 are documented gang members, the agency said, and five are known gang associates. Investigation is under way to determine other suspects' possible gang involvement.
8 more Utah workers probed in leak of data
Eight more employees from the Utah Department of Workforce Services are being questioned in connection with a leaked list containing personal information of 1,300 alleged illegal immigrants, a department spokesman said Monday.
That makes a total of 10 employees questioned, including the two placed on administrative leave last week.
Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said he expects to launch a formal investigation into the data leak very soon.
The list was anonymously distributed last week to news media and government offices across the state. An accompanying letter from "Concerned Citizens of the United States" insisted that those on the list should be deported immediately.
Guard troops to start border duty in August
National Guard forces will begin deploying along the U.S. border with Mexico in August, officials said Monday.
Some 1,200 Army and Air National Guard troops will serve for a year as a "gap-filler" while the Customs and Border Patrol agency hires additional staff to increase monitoring of the almost 2,000-mile-long border with Mexico.
Troops from California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas will be fully trained and in place by Sept. 1, but will not be involved in such activities as arrests, Guard officials said. They will assist the Border Patrol in looking for illegal border crossers and smugglers as well as taking part in intelligence gathering.

SEOUL, South Korea -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates arrived in Seoul on Monday for a high-level show of unity expected to include the announcement of major military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea.
Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton plan talks with their South Korean counterparts that U.S. officials said were aimed at sending a signal to North Korea in response to the sinking of a South Korean warship, allegedly by Northern forces.
Officials said the military exercises involving air and naval units have been in the works since the March 26 sinking, but an official announcement was delayed until after U.N. Security Council deliberations on the incident concluded.
The council's response condemning the sinking but stopping short of blaming the North has elevated the importance of the Gates-Clinton visit and the exercises.

Iraqi pol searches far afield for support
Pro-Western Iraqi politician Ayad Allawi sought support Monday to form a government from Iranian-backed cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, in the first meeting between the once bitter rivals. Al-Sadr, an anti-U.S. figure who has emerged as a kingmaker in Iraqi politics, did not endorse Allawi but said Allawi had shown more willingness to compromise than Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. The two met in Syria.

Full text: U.S. National Guard forces will begin deploying along the U.S. border with Mexico in August and will be fully trained and deployed by the end of the month, government officials announced Monday.
Some 1,200 Army and Air National Guard troops will be in place for a year to assist the Border Patrol in monitoring and capturing illegal immigrants crossing the border into the U.S.
They will serve as a "gap-filler" while the Customs and Border Patrol agency hires additional staff to fill the demand in protection along the almost 2,000-mile-long southern border with Mexico.
The Guard troops will not be involved in law enforcement activities such as arrests of illegal immigrants, but will assist the Border Patrol in looking for the illegal border crossers and smugglers as well as in intelligence gathering.
The airmen and soldiers will be armed, but they will be limited by rules of engagement that allow them to shoot only to defend themselves, said Gen. Craig McKinley, commander of the National Guard.
"The rules for the use of force will be well coordinated, and they're the same as our counternarcotics teams that are there now -- for self-preservation only, self-defense only," he said.
The deployment is part of President Obama's border plan announced in late May, when he also requested $500 million in supplemental funds to try to reduce the number of immigrants and smugglers crossing the border daily.
Guard troops will be doled out along the border where the needs are the greatest, according to federal officials.
"We're placing a particular emphasis on the Tucson sector in Arizona, an area favored by smugglers and the principal point of illegal entry into the United States along the southwest border," said John Morton, assistant secretary for immigration and customs enforcement at the Department of Homeland Security.

WHERE AND WHEN?
The troops, from the four border states, will be fully trained and in place in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas by Sept. 1, according to Gen. Craig McKinley, commander of the National Guard.

Full text: Orange County supervisors approved a contract Tuesday to house federal immigration detainees at two county jails, a deal that will bring in more than $30 million a year and help save jobs in the Sheriff's Department.
The Sheriff's Department has been negotiating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for months to house more than 800 detainees at the James A. Musick Facility near Irvine and the Theo Lacy Facility in Orange.
The jails could see the first influx of detainees as early as the first week of August. Sheriff Sandra Hutchens said the flow of detainees to the jails will be gradual -- arriving in groups of a couple of dozen -- building up to a maximum of 838.
The jails have dorm-like facilities that Immigration and Customs Enforcement prefers for holding detainees, former inmates who have completed their sentence and have been transferred to federal custody pending resolution of their immigration status.
Often, the detainees are ultimately deported and those who are released will be transferred to federal institutions and released there.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement has no facility of its own in the greater Los Angeles/Orange County area and contracts with local jails to house detainees or sends them to other states. Both the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Santa Ana Police Department jails house immigration detainees.
The five-year contract will bring in about $31 million for the current fiscal year and $35 million each for the next four years, at a daily rate of $118 per detainee. The Sheriff's Department will get $94.15 of that and the remaining $23.85 will go to the Orange County Health Care Agency, which will provide medical and mental health services.
The money will help the Sheriff's Department offset a projected $65-million budget shortfall next year and stave off additional cutbacks and layoffs.
"We did save jobs," Hutchens said after the meeting, but added that it was difficult to say how many.
As part of the contract, both jails will undergo some renovations for Immigration and Customs Enforcement staff office space. Space suitable for courtrooms will be found at Musick for deportation proceedings.
Orange County has more than 6,600 jail beds, the Sheriff's Department said, and more than 2,000 of them are empty.
Earlier this year, the Sheriff's Department released several hundred inmates before the completion of their sentences. At the time, critics accused Hutchens of timing the early releases to make room for federal detainees. The sheriff, though, said the releases were mandated by a new state law that recalculated how much of an inmate's sentence needs to be served.
Though the contract's approval is welcome news for the department's budget, it faces opposition from the city of Orange.
On Monday, that city's attorney sent a letter to county supervisors, saying the contract could violate a 1995 agreement that prevents Theo Lacy from being expanded, physically or operationally. The jail is in the middle of a sprawling county complex, across the street from the Block at Orange shopping center. The city will take up the matter at next Tuesday's meeting.

Is it any wonder our nation is sinking deeper into debt when Homeland Security's inspector general thinks $4,535 on average is "a reasonable cost" for each untrained dog purchased to join our customs and border protection efforts?
I recommend the inspector general assign a team to do a search at the local animal shelters and on PetFinder.com, where they will find thousands of retrievers, shepherds and other working breeds for a mere $100 or so adoption fee.
That would equate to a savings of $13,605,000 over the next five years for the 3,000 dogs they plan to purchase from breeders -- and would also give smart, hardworking dogs a second chance at life.

I am not in favor of using animals for any form of work.
These dogs are put in danger constantly. If they sniff for bombs, there is a chance they will get blown up. If they sniff for drugs, there is a chance they will be shot. Some of them will be screened for "the ability to disregard blows from a stick." I couldn't imagine giving a dog to someone who told me the dog might get hit now and again -- and will have to put up with it.
This is just another example of how we use
and abuse animals in our society.

Wielding the budget ax
Re "Chiang hitches wagon to an ax," July 16
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's spokesman, Aaron McLear, thinks that 3 1/2 years "is more than enough time [for John Chiang] to figure out how to do his job" -- as though Chiang's job description includes taking advantage of state employees.
Ha ha. Very funny, McLear. The Legislature has had decades to learn how to come up with a budget, yet it and the governor still can't figure it out.
It is time for Californians to get serious about constitutional reform, which could end this state's budgeting deadlock.
State workers are
not pawns. They did
not agree to fund the
state deficit from their personal savings, as Chiang knows.
In this battle, Chiang is David fighting Goliath.
I am rooting for Chiang.

The $64,000 question
Re "A rich political question," July 17
Few of us begrudge the successful accumulation of wealth through hard work, wise business practices or smart financial decisions, however unpopular.
But when wealth is gained at the expense of integrity and moral certitude, then something is seriously wrong.
Carly Fiorina got rich as she (unapologetically) drove U.S. tech leader Hewlett-Packard into the ground. How would she do with the federal budget? Would she care?
Meg Whitman apparently feels it's OK to use Goldman Sachs' advice to profit personally at the expense of her company, to the tune of $1.78 million. Would she feel the same way about abusing her position as governor?
Wealth has nothing to do with it. The real question is: Do we really want these women running our state?

Deaths in the desert
Re "Immigrant deaths in Arizona desert soar with temperatures," July 17, and "Mexico arrests shed light on migrant-kidnapping outfits," July 18
It's a tragedy that 40 illegal immigrants have died of heat-related problems so far in July.
Add to this the kidnappings of migrants on the Mexican side of the border by heavily armed bandits, as reported by The Times, and the failure of our federal government to enforce border controls, and you see a cynicism beyond belief.
How many more of these unfortunates must be tempted in our direction before we realize that lax border enforcement can be deadly -- very deadly?
Perhaps Arizona's SB 1070 is more humane than the current federal administration can appreciate.

Ask again
Re "The Arizona effect," Opinion, July 16
Maria Elena Durazo's poll of Latino voters produced responses that might have been expected. The question the executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor didn't appear to have asked was how Latino voters -- legal California residents -- feel about unchecked illegal immigration and the resulting competition for housing, services and jobs. I would like to hear an answer to that question.

No sympathy for a lawyer
Re "Chill the lawyers," Opinion, July 15
The case against Lynne Stewart couldn't be more clear, despite Petra Bartosiewicz's apologetic article on her behalf. Stewart represents all that's wrong with our legal system, and her strident anti-American activities have finally come back to haunt her.
It is to our society's benefit that she has been judged in a post-9/11 context, and not the contrary, as Bartosiewicz suggests. With supporters such as Ramsey Clark and George Soros rallying to her side, it's no wonder the government took another long look at her case and decided that 2 1/2 years was far too lenient.
Stewart knew the rules and blatantly violated them because she believed her status would overcome any legal improprieties. If she had followed the letter of the law, she wouldn't be facing her current dilemma. She deserves no sympathy and should receive none.

Live music and paying the piper
Re "The tour has lost its force," July 16
After six years of evenings at home with our young children, my husband and I recently enjoyed an incredible performance by Sugarland at the Greek Theatre.
Two tickets (with partially obstructed views), parking, one drink and a babysitter for the evening added up to $220. Additionally, with commute and parking times included, the whole ordeal took six hours -- for one solid hour of performance time.
$220 would buy 20 albums on iTunes and give us the opportunity to share new music with our family at home.
With this in mind, I am not surprised to read that large concerts are losing their audience. Luckily, there are many venues in Southern California that offer low-cost or free concerts so that I can enjoy live music on a regular basis.

::
Though I feel for investors whose dividends have slimmed as Live Nation's stock continues to slide, I have no sympathy for a company that, after acquiring Ticketmaster, charges exorbitant prices for tickets and other so-called convenience fees -- so much so that I found it preferable to drive to a venue and stand in line for tickets.
Perhaps all the canceled shows will serve as a wake-up call for them to take off their ski masks and stop robbing us blind.

What children bring to the table
Re "Kids -- to have or have not," Opinion, July 15
A famous anthropologist is alleged to have said: "When you calculate the cost of raising a child, it is hard to justify having them. But if one does not have children, he will find himself in old age and discover that his life has been meaningless."
That doesn't mean that people can't have fulfilled lives without children, and there are wrong ways of raising children that aren't fulfilling.
But there are right ways, and for me, being a daddy has been the most important and rewarding thing I have ever done.
My children, now adults, add to that enjoyment and reaffirm my feelings. This isn't important, but both were adopted -- so it really was a choice to have them.

Full text: In January, President Obama pledged not to forsake or forget Haiti during what promised to be a long and painful recovery from the worst earthquake to hit the island nation in 200 years. To that end, the administration immediately sent military assistance and millions of dollars in emergency aid. But it has yet to take another crucial step: expediting the immigration to the United States of the 55,000 Haitians who already have been approved for visas by the Department of Homeland Security.
These Haitians, sponsored by relatives who are either legal residents or citizens, have met all requirements; among other things, they have provided the government with legally binding affidavits from family members guaranteeing financial support so that they do not become a public burden. Due to a monumental backlog of visas available for Haitians, however, the process can take from four to 11 years. Given the dire circumstances in Haiti and the administration's promise of staunch support, it is both logical and humane to accelerate this process. And there is precedent for doing so. In 2007, President George W. Bush allowed Cubans whose family petitions had been approved to enter the country ahead of schedule, and he did the same for refugees from Indochina and Kosovo. Haitians certainly need visas just as badly, so why the disparate treatment?
Removing tens of thousands of people from Haiti's ruins and allowing them to live and work in the United States would automatically turn them into providers and benefactors, speeding the country's recovery. Even before the 7.0 earthquake, remittances were crucial to its survival, but now they are indispensable. Millions of Haitians living abroad, including about 800,000 in the U.S., sent home nearly $2 billion last year, and World Bank economists expect to see a 20% surge this year. And the bang for the buck is significant, with up to 10 people benefiting from the funds sent home by each emigrant.
Legislation to create a family reunification program for Haitians, modeled on the Cuban program, is pending in Congress. But it is unnecessary. Obama only has to give the order and the Department of Homeland Security will move Haitians to the front of the line. Time is of the essence; 1 million people remain displaced, and hurricane season has begun.
The Obama administration has kept its word about sending money to Haiti, but the country's recovery cannot progress without the assistance of its diaspora. Obama should help Haitians to help themselves.

Full text: On a patch of asphalt outside the White House this week, Renata Teodoro, Maricela Aguilar and scores of other students are risking deportation simply by sharing their full names and immigration status with anyone who asks.
In an act of defiance unimaginable to many in their parents' generation, they are publicly declaring that they are in the United States illegally as a way to push for change that would help thousands of undocumented young people like them. And they are doing so in one of the most highly patrolled -- and politicized -- spots in the country.
"I'm not going to lie and say that I'm not afraid of someone coming in and trying to arrest me, but I can't let that fear take over my life," said Teodoro, 22, a student at the University of Massachusetts in Boston whose parents were deported back to Brazil a couple of years ago. "The only way of people finding out about my situation is to tell my story."
She and other undocumented high school and college students and graduates have been streaming into Washington this week to demand passage of the Dream Act, legislation that would give unauthorized young immigrants a path to legal residency if they contribute to the country by serving in the military or getting a college education.
Most of the students have lived in the United States from a young age and consider themselves Americans. They are attending "classes" at what organizers have dubbed the "Dream University," meeting with legislators, and, in a notable shift from previous years, giving out their full names and personal histories.
On Tuesday, almost two dozen activists went one step further, staging sit-ins inside the Senate Hart Office Building that resulted in 21 arrests for disorderly conduct. Those charged could be referred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, although it is not a given that they would face deportation as a result.
"We don't necessarily take action on everyone who is referred to us," said Gillian Brigham, a spokeswoman for ICE.
The willingness of these young people to confront authorities in Washington and elsewhere is a far cry from the approach of most illegal immigrants, who are usually anxious to avoid calling attention to themselves. Many are deeply worried about the passage of a controversial law in Arizona that will give police the power to question people they suspect of being illegal immigrants. Other states are considering similar measures.
"It is a bit of a surprise to see how bold and open a lot of the young people are about their status, and that's changed from the past," said Margie McHugh, co-director of the nonprofit Migration Policy Institute's National Center on Immigrant Integration Policy, who said it was unclear what the consequences for them could be.
The students typically come from families that have strived to stay off the radar of immigration authorities. Sometimes they do not even tell their children that they are here illegally, hoping that they will absorb the confidence and ambition of their American friends and neighbors.
Many have done just that, and increasingly are acting like typical American college students: openly embracing a cause they believe in.
"I think there's an empowerment that comes with giving your name," said Aguilar, 19, a political science and English major at Marquette University in Milwaukee who calls herself a Midwesterner and has the accent to prove it.
She and others said their public declarations are a relief from the tension of always hiding. In fact, they hope the tactic will advance their cause and protect them from deportation.
"Our friends and our family are always telling us not to do it," said Francisco Gutierrez, 18, a Georgetown University student who moved to the United States from Mexico when he was 3 and had just started giving out his name. "I tell them we can't be fearful any more. We can't live our lives afraid that there's always something going to happen to us, just because we are undocumented."
Carlos Saavedra, national coordinator of the United We Dream Network, agreed. "We are losing the fear," said Saavedra, whose organization, a coalition of immigrant youth groups, organized many of the events and plans to continue them into August.
He gestured at the 20 or so students sitting in rows, some holding umbrellas in sweltering Lafayette Square. No one in the group -- which included his brother Rodrigo, who is 16 and undocumented -- appeared nervous, although ICE headquarters is not far from the White House.
"They know we're here," Saavedra said, "and we have not seen anything more than park police telling us to move here and move there."
Brigham would not comment specifically on the students outside the White House, but she said ICE puts a priority on deporting illegal immigrants with criminal backgrounds. In the past two years, the percentage of those deported with criminal backgrounds has risen from 31 percent to 50 percent, she said. Of the 227,163 people removed in the first half of this year, 113,453 were identified as criminal aliens.
Meanwhile, an estimated 65,000 illegal immigrants graduate from U.S. high schools each year. Some are able to enroll in college, but they can have difficulty obtaining financial aid because of their status.
Although ICE could go after the students, they are making a calculation that publicity, even arrest, can work in their favor, said observers on both side of the immigration issue.
"In a sense, going forward to the media affords protection," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tighter immigration controls. "They're striking a pose of bravado knowing perfectly well that there's absolutely no chance that they're going to be [deported] once they've given an interview to the newspaper."
Immigration activists cite the case of Eric Balderas, a Harvard undergraduate and immigrant from Mexico who was arrested last month for being in the United States illegally. Deportation proceedings against him were halted after extensive publicity and lobbying by Harvard officials and Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).
Deportation has been deferred for others in similar straits after their stories appeared in the news. Brigham said ICE grants deferments on a case-by-case basis.
But not everyone wants to test immigration authorities.
At a "Coming Out" rally in Chicago in March, some students gave only their first names. At a May 1 rally in Washington, several gave their names to reporters but avoided being arrested at a sit-in. In Arizona a few days later, undocumented students staged a protest in front of Republican Sen. John McCain's office. Three were arrested and are in deportation proceedings.
One of them, Mohammad Abdollahi, 24, whose family moved to Michigan from Iran when he was 3, said he is hoping the publicity surrounding his case will lead to a deferment, though he knows that there is no guarantee.
Aguilar, whose family moved to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 3, said she didn't reveal her status for years, even while working as an activist for undocumented students.
"You'd always say everything in the third person," she said. But this year, when activists were planning a series of "coming out" events, she decided it was time to switch to the first person.
Whether giving out their names will help the students achieve their goals remains to be seen.
"I think it's not possible to say yet if it's a safe or an extremely risky thing for them to do," McHugh said. "They are taking a great risk in putting themselves out there so publicly. In the end, they'll be judged to have been quite prescient if the law does end up happening and naive if it doesn't."

Gov. Manchin Announces
Bid for Byrd's Senate Seat
West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat with high statewide approval ratings, announced his bid Tuesday to fill the Senate seat formerly held by the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd.
Mr. Manchin could boost Democrats' chances to hold onto the Senate seat. But the 62-year-old former state lawmaker isn't expected to fall in line behind some of the more liberal elements of the Democrats' agenda, in particular an energy bill that would affect his coal-producing state.
No Republican candidate has officially entered the race. State lawmakers late Monday approved a bill that would set an Aug. 28 primary and Nov. 2 election for the Senate seat.

FDA Panel Rejects Avastin
For Treating Breast Cancer
A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel Tuesday called on the agency to revoke its approval of Roche Holding AG's Avastin as a breast-cancer treatment after studies failed to show benefit.
The FDA will make the final decision on whether to remove the indication. If that happens, it would mean that Roche couldn't market the product for use in treating breast cancer, but it wouldn't affect the marketing status for colon, lung and other cancers for which Avastin is approved.
The panel voted 12-1 in favor of removing Avastin's use in treating advanced, or metastatic breast cancer. The FDA is expected to make a decision by Sept. 17.

FLORIDA
House Ends Special Session
Without Vote on Drill Ban
The Republican-controlled Florida House ended a special session just 43 minutes after it began without voting on Gov. Charlie Crist's proposed state constitutional amendment to ban offshore drilling in state waters.
The nearly party-line vote to adjourn might have dealt a legislative defeat in record time to Mr. Crist, who quit the GOP to run for the U.S. Senate as an independent. But the move handed Mr. Crist, as well as Democrats, a campaign issue.
Mr. Crist had called lawmakers into special session in a bid to put the drilling ban on the November ballot in response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which has put the state's tourism industry under a cloud. Republicans say the amendment isn't needed because state law already bans drilling and that the issue can wait until 2012.

GEORGIA
Rough Republican Runoff
Set in Governor's Race
Georgia voters set the stage for a tumultuous November gubernatorial race in which Roy Barnes, a Democratic former governor, threatens to wrest the office back from Republicans in a conservative Southern state.
Former Secretary of State Karen Handel and former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal are headed for the Aug. 10 runoff for the Republican nomination, according to the Associated Press. Ms. Handel was endorsed by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin; Mr. Deal, by former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich. The runoff campaign will likely be a contest about who is more conservative on immigration, abortion and gay rights.
Mr. Barnes, who defeated the state's attorney general, among others, lost a bid for re-election in 2002 after a single term.

Lohan Reports to Jail
On Probation Violation
Whisked away to a women's jail in an unmarked sheriff's car after a brief hearing, Lindsay Lohan reported Tuesday for a 90-day sentence that the troubled actress likely will serve in isolation, and which may be significantly shortened.
The 24-year-old showed up at the Beverly Hills courtroom about 10 minutes late. After a short hearing, she was handcuffed behind her back to serve her time for a probation violation.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel sentenced the "Mean Girls"" star to 90 days in jail, three months in rehab and increased scrutiny by probation officials on July 6 after determining she violated her probation by missing seven alcohol education classes since December.

Abstract: Arab women in the U.S. are often without the strong network of extended family that is traditional in Arab countries, and that can make dealing with the many cultural issues they face here very stressful. The Arab-American Women's Committee brings together women who recently have come to the United States with more established immigrants to discuss problems and find better ways of coping with social challenges, said the organization's associate director, Rasmea Yousef.

Full text: Randa Ibrahim was serving coffee to the guests in her Palos Hills living room when her 17-year-old daughter distractedly breezed through the living room and out the back door without so much as a nod.
"She won't come say hi," Ibrahim said disapprovingly. "I don't like the way she just comes through."
Showing respect to elders is important in Arab-American culture. Ibrahim, a 47-year-old Palestinian woman who grew up in Kuwait before coming to the United States in 1982 has tried to instill in her children the values she was raised with.
"I teach them the right ways. I take care of them," said Ibrahim, but American culture has taken root, too.
Arab women in the U.S. are often without the strong network of extended family that is traditional in Arab countries, and that can make dealing with the many cultural issues they face here very stressful. Many feel isolated and in some cases may suffer from depression, say officials at the Chicago-based Arab-American Action Network, which a little more than three years ago organized a group to help them cope better.
The Arab-American Women's Committee brings together women who recently have come to the United States with more established immigrants to discuss problems and find better ways of coping with social challenges, said the organization's associate director, Rasmea Yousef. It aims to help women bridge cultural gaps while helping them become community leaders.
"We help them express feelings," said Yousef, who formed the group a little more than three years ago. "Traditionally, women didn't speak about private things. They thought it was shameful."
Abdalla Ali is a family therapist in Dearborn, Mich., home to the largest Arab U.S. population. (The Arab-American Action Network estimates there are 220,000 in the Chicago area). He said Arab-Americans face an array of challenges and estimates that of the 1,400 patients in his clinic, 600 to 800 have been diagnosed with depression or, in the case of war refugees, post-traumatic stress disorder.
Many lack the language skills and education levels that can help find jobs, leading to financial strain. For women, the issues that arise with raising children here can be very stressful, he said. As children start to Americanize to fit in with their peers at school, tension rises.
If mothers, usually the ones dealing with issues at school, don't speak English, they have trouble communicating with children's teachers and heading off problems. Language barriers may arise within the family, too.
"The most important thing here is communication," said Ali, who added that he was a translator during a counseling session for a mother who spoke only Arabic and her teenage son who spoke only English.
"It really depends on the family. When a father and mother can't follow their kids in school and go to the parents meetings and read what the school sends home, you have a very difficult burden to manage," he said. "Families often try to hide these problems, this shame."
One way women are encouraged to open up is by sharing what they are going through, said Faida Sahouri, a group member and one of the relatively few Arab-American women therapists in the Chicago area.
"When they talk about [issues they face], it makes it less of a burden. It makes them feel better after that," said Sahouri, who facilitates a creative writing project for the group.
The group is working on its second volume of collected stories as a result of the writing project. Several of the stories recounted ugly incidents involving ethnic or religious targeting, which also add to families' stress, she said.
When Ibrahim decided at age 30 to cover her head with a hijab and dress in an abaya -- a robe traditionally worn by Muslim women -- she was surprised by the reactions she received.
"When I started wearing a hijab, my neighbor, she doesn't know me," she said. "I saw her in school and said hi, and she turned her face. I thought maybe she didn't know me, but I had my kids with me. She knows my kids."
Ibrahim said that since joining the women's group, she has become a stronger, more independent woman. When her husband was overprotective, she didn't challenge him. She was always exhausted from taking care of the kids, making sure the house was perfect, and fielding phone calls from her mother-in-law, who she said would quiz her about what meals she was planning to cook.
Now she teaches Arabic as a second language, works with her daughter as a DJ at weddings and sells Mary Kay cosmetics. When she decided to go back to school at DePaul University to become certified to teach Arabic, she said her husband "got crazy."
"He said, 'How will you go?' " Ibrahim recalled. "My friend said, 'It's OK, we'll find a way.' "
But she said some topics are still easier to write about in the group.
Ibrahim wrote a play about a mother who was oblivious to her teenage son's drug use. She and her friends performed the play, which blended humor and education, for 150 women at an Arab-American Action Network event.
As Ibrahim describes the play, Yousef beams: "When I first met Randa, I knew she (would) be a leader."

Full text: Panel warns against Avastin
FDA urged to pull OK as breast cancer treatment
GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- A U.S. advisory panel dealt a blow Tuesday to Roche Holding AG's multibillion-dollar cancer drug Avastin, urging Food and Drug Administration officials to revoke the medicine's approval for breast cancer.
If regulators follow that advice, the Swiss drugmaker could no longer promote Avastin for that use in the United States.
Doctors still could prescribe Avastin for breast cancer as it would retain approval for colon, lung, brain and kidney cancers, but sales likely would fall.
Breast cancer treatment accounts for about $1 billion of Avastin's more than $6 billion in annual sales, analysts said. The product is Roche's top-selling drug.
Members of an FDA panel said they did not see enough of a benefit from Avastin in advanced breast cancer to justify its serious risks. They voted 12-1 to urge the FDA to remove the breast cancer approval.
The drug's risks include gastrointestinal perforations, bleeding and blood clots.
Roche said rates of those problems were low, at less than 4 percent in the breast cancer trials.
But the panel's chairman, Wyndham Wilson, a National Cancer Institute researcher, said there was definitive evidence that Avastin causes serious and life-threatening side effects. "Small numbers, but if you're the one, that's not what you want to be exposed to," he said.
Overall data "does not support this being effective" in advanced breast cancer, Wilson added.
The FDA usually follows panel recommendations. The vote was a rare setback for Avastin, a widely used treatment for a variety of cancers.
Roche unit Genentech said the company stands by its data showing Avastin helps patients with advanced breast cancer.
Avastin won clearance for breast cancer in 2008 under a shorter approval process, but Roche was required to run two follow-up studies to confirm the drug's effectiveness and receive full approval.
Those studies failed to confirm the level of benefit seen in the initial breast cancer trial, FDA staff said.

U.S. looks to boost aid to AU force in Somalia
WASHINGTON -- The United States is prepared to step up assistance to African Union forces in Somalia and take more aggressive action against al-Shabab Islamist rebels who carried out deadly bombings in Uganda earlier this month, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
U.S. intelligence agencies have warned of growing links between al-Shabab in Somalia and al-Qaida's network in East Africa, and the U.S. has made it a priority to track and target top militants in both groups, officials said.
The expanded U.S. military assistance to African Union forces could include additional equipment, training, logistical support and information-sharing, officials said.
Stolen painting disputesettled for $19 million
NEW YORK -- The Leopold Museum in Austria has agreed to pay an Austrian Jewish woman's estate $19 million for a painting that a judge ruled a Nazi stole from her during World War II.
The move ends a decade-long legal battle, which began after the oil painting, "Portrait of Wally" by Egon Schiele, was lent to New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1997. The painting was seized by U.S. officials in 1999 and the government sought to return it to the estate of Lea Bondi Jaray, who died in 1969.
U.S. authorities argued the painting was stolen in 1939 and ended up with collector Rudolph Leopold in the 1950s. On Tuesday the museum agreed to settle the case and will receive the painting back, attorneys for Jaray's estate said.

Mass. law bans removal of animals' vocal cords
BOSTON -- Massachusetts on Wednesday will become the first state to ban surgery that devocalizes dogs and cats, which many animal rights advocates see as cruel and unnecessary.
Under the new law, anyone in the state who cuts or removes an animal's vocal cords for nonmedical reasons may be fined and imprisoned up to five years.
The law, signed by Gov. Deval Patrick in April, is dubbed Logan's Law after a dog that underwent the controversial surgery but was later abandoned.
Some of those opposing the bill argued that more animals would be surrendered to shelters or abandoned if the surgery is banned.
Palin-backed candidate takes lead in Georgia
ATLANTA -- A candidate endorsed by Sarah Palin appeared headed for a runoff in her bid for the Republican nomination in Georgia's gubernatorial race, while former Gov. Roy Barnes took a commanding lead in the Democratic contest.
Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, had been lifted to front-runner status in the polls after she was endorsed last week by Palin, the GOP's 2008 vice presidential candidate.
With 68 percent of precincts reporting, Handel led in unofficial results with 34 percent of the vote. Former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal had 23 percent. A runoff is scheduled for Aug. 10 if no candidate receives at least 50 percent of the vote.
On the Democratic side, Barnes had nearly 66 percent of the vote.
Utah firing 2 who sent data from state files
SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah is firing two state employees who compiled and made public a list of 1,300 purported illegal immigrants that included private information taken from state files, officials said Tuesday.
The Utah Department of Workforce Services announced the termination of one temporary employee of that agency, which maintains a database containing information found on the list, and said a second worker would soon be dismissed.
The 29-page document containing birth dates, Social Security numbers, pregnancy due dates, home addresses and other personal information was circulated to law enforcement agencies, news media outlets and state lawmakers by a group calling itself Concerned Citizens of the United States with the demand that those named be deported.

Full text: Lacking logic
The facts surrounding the proposed U.S. Postal Service rate increase from 44 to 46 cents prove beyond doubt that the service is totally, egregiously inept. Mailings via the USPS have been slashed because companies caught in the recession have reduced mailings at the 44-cent rate. The 46-cent rate will lose the service additional customers, not gain it new ones; revenue will go down again or remain flat at best as a result.
Also, by its own estimates, the service will raise only 2.3 billion new dollars of revenue when it projects a $7 billion shortfall. Lose more customers to gain only a third of the projected deficit? Nonsense!
The only way for the USPS to survive long term is to make it a subsidiary of the new National Health Care Administration, where funding will apparently be unlimited regardless of results.

Political pork
While driving back from Texas recently, I saw an advertising sign for a barbecue restaurant that said: "It's a wonderful place, and it's all about pork."
This could also be an appropriate description for the United States Congress, the Illinois legislature, the Cook County Board and the Chicago City Council.
I hope this advertising slogan will remind voters that political pork is a major reason for our governmental debts at all levels, and do something about it on Election Day.
-- Vance Gregory Jr., Wheaton
Welcoming illegals
If we don't deport illegal immigrants residing in Arizona, and if we allow waves of undocumented people to invade our country illegally, we would be laying out a welcome doormat for the whole world to move here indiscriminately.
Why bother to scrutinize passengers at the airports?
Such frivolity is ruining, and will accelerate destruction of, our United States of America. President Barack Obama's immensely unpopular solution is to simply rename the oxymoron "illegal immigrants" into "legal immigrants."
Maybe we should just release all criminals now in jail, or would that be illegal?
-- Frank J. Sasevich, Bolingbrook
Canceling insurance
The Republicans are again talking about the president's health care bill having death panels. The only death panels in this country are the ones that the health care providers have in their contracts. How many people in this country have died because their health insurance was canceled and they couldn't afford treatment?
We are not just talking about senior citizens. We are talking about kids also.
I have never heard one Republican politician come out in protest of the health care industry canceling insurance on families with children.
-- Bob Freed, Naperville
Voting option
With elections less than four months away, and many citizens disgusted with government at all levels, perhaps it is time to allow voters to express their anger by giving them a voting option that says something like: "Dissatisfied with all candidates."
Let's face it: Rare is the incumbent or challenger who represents anything more than the status quo. Americans should be demanding much more from their elected representatives. Government at all levels has to be made aware of the extent of discontent. We cannot continue to tolerate politicians whose primary interest is preserving their public careers or winning an election, all the while ignoring the people who elected them.
Perhaps, as a start, we can vote "dissatisfied" to show the depth of our frustration. At the very least, we won't be guilty of helping to return or install into office rascals who likely aren't going to do anything real to alleviate the crisis our communities, states and nation face.
-- Dennis Shere, North Aurora
Educating voters
Thank you for your work as a watchdog of government. It's comforting to know that someone is bringing it to light. I just hope enough of the public is reading it so they can do something about it in November.

Parenting lessons
This is in response to "Happy Meal hot potato; Rising rate of child obesity ramps up debate over fast food chains' use of toys to sell burgers, fries" (Page 1, July 8). To all of you who have no control over your children's "demand" to have the toy in the Happy Meal: Don't buy the Happy Meal. Buy a "healthy" alternative and then buy the toy for about $1.50.
Then tune in to "SuperNanny" and learn how to become a real parent to your children.

ATLANTA -- Georgia voters set the stage for a tumultuous fall gubernatorial race in which Roy Barnes, a Democratic former governor, threatens to wrest the office back from Republicans in a staunchly conservative Southern state.
Former Secretary of State Karen Handel and former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal are headed for the Aug. 10 runoff for the Republican nomination, according to the Associated Press. The three-week runoff will likely be dominated by a continued brawl over who is more conservative on immigration, abortion and gay rights.
Ms. Handel had 33% of the vote to Mr. Deal's 24%, in unofficial results. They both led former state Senate President Eric Johnson, who had 20%, and the race's former favorite, Georgia Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, who had 17%. Mr. Barnes handily won the Democratic nomination, beating the attorney general, among others.
After months of trailing Mr. Oxendine in the race, Ms. Handel surged to the front of the field after a late endorsement from former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Ms. Palin's support has given a timely boost to several GOP women nationwide this primary season, including South Carolina gubernatorial nominee Nikki Haley. Mr. Deal got a lift from the endorsement of his one-time colleague, former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich.
Mr. Oxendine had been the front-runner for months, raising more money than his opponents and leveraging his status as the only current statewide officeholder in the GOP field. Mr. Oxendine also allied himself with Tea Party activists and made denunciations of the Obama administration and the new federal healthcare bill the keystone of his campaign.
But controversy has dogged most of the Republican field, with the candidates firebombing each other over alleged ethical abuses. Mr. Oxendine has been sidetracked by questions about campaign contributions from insurance interests. Mr. Deal has been fending off accusations that he sought preferential government treatment for his businesses, and Mr. Johnson, the former Senate leader, has been criticized for being too lenient in an ethics probe of the former House speaker. Ms. Handel has also come under scrutiny, distancing herself from the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay Republican advocacy group whose support she once sought.
Ms. Handel repeatedly refused to participate in party debates if it required sharing a stage with rival Ray McBerry, a former school teacher and self-avowed "states-rights" candidate, who was accused of an inappropriate relationship with a female student. He has denied any misconduct and was never criminally charged. Mr. McBerry is also a director of the Confederate heritage group League of the South.
Ms. Handel opposes abortion but has made an appeal to women voters by highlighting her support of exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. She was the only major Republican candidate not to get the stamp of approval from the Georgia Right to Life Political Action Committee because of that stance.
She also attacked her rivals in a recent television ad titled "Lipstick." It showed pictures of her three top-tier male opponents as a female voice (Marilyn Quayle, in an uncredited cameo) says, "Three with iffy ethics, one who wears lipstick." The ad further describes Ms. Handel as moving out of an abusive home as a teenager and working her way up to the White House as an aide to Mrs. Quayle, the vice-president's wife.
Mr. Deal represented North Georgia for nine terms in the House, resigning last year to run for governor. He has focused on immigration reform, and once authored legislation to end birthright citizenship for babies born in the U.S. whose parents were illegal immigrants.
A poll completed for a coalition of Georgia newspapers on July 13--one day after Ms. Palin's endorsement--showed Mr. Oxendine with the support of 31 percent of Republican voters, Ms. Handel at 23 percent and Mr. Deal at 18 percent.
Five days later, however, the same pollsters released a second poll showing Ms. Handel at 29 percent and Messrs. Oxendine and Deal at about 20 percent.
The July 13 poll showed Mr. Barnes, the former one-term governor, beating Ms. Handel and Mr. Deal in a hypothetical match-up. Mr. Barnes lost his 2002 re-election bid to Sonny Perdue, partly in backlash for his successful fight to remove the Confederate battle symbol from the state flag.
Georgia is a reliably Republican state, voting 52% for Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008 and 58% to re-elect President George W. Bush in 2004. Mr. Barnes remains popular with the Democratic base and is running as a no-nonsense candidate critical of both parties. His new ad criticizes the Republican-led legislature for wasting time on frivolous legislation, such as requiring consent before implanting microchips in the brain.

The economic downturn has left more Americans with the daunting prospect of fighting court battles without a lawyer.
A growing number of people have found themselves in court facing costly financial proceedings such as declaring bankruptcy, fighting foreclosure and litigating employment fights. Adding to the challenge, for many: The high cost of legal representation often prompts them to go it alone.
Jillian Edgar of Brooklyn, N.Y., is one example. The 32-year-old, who says she has been unsuccessfully looking for work since October, is fighting an eviction notice that claims she owes more than $2,800.
Last week in Kings Country Housing Court, she said she didn't know the steps to take to qualify for free legal aid. Still, she said, "I think I can handle myself." Her plan: to say that she withheld rent because her apartment had fallen into disrepair.
Legal experts say many people are likely losing claims and paying penalties they could have avoided with a lawyer at their side. Litigants often don't understand the sort of evidence they need to present in legal proceedings, said Florida state Judge Claudia Isom.
She said she has seen a jump in people defending against mortgage-foreclosure proceedings without the aid of counsel, for instance, and they are "definitely at a disadvantage."
"People will gather legal information from the Internet, from friends, or leaflets at a courthouse and think, 'I can play checkers, I'm ready,' " said Raymond Brescia, a professor at Albany Law School, who has written about tenants' struggles to afford legal representation. "But when they get to court they realize it's a game of three-level chess, and they don't have the first idea of what's happening."
Legal representation is expensive, and some critics say lawyers have created quasi-monopolies in some areas that raise the cost of their services.
"You can hardly find a lawyer who charges less than $150 per hour, which is out of reach for most people," said Gillian Hadfield, a law professor at the University of Southern California.
In many areas, from immigration and family law to bankruptcy and housing disputes, she said, nonlawyer specialists could be trained to provide useful legal assistance. But nonlawyers who represent clients in court or provide other legal help face prosecution for the unauthorized practice of law, a violation of state bar rules.
"The U.S. is unusual in how restrictive the rules are on who can give you assistance in court," Ms. Hadfield said.
Many who go without a lawyer are too well off to qualify for free legal aid, even if they can't foot the bill for private lawyers, attorneys said. "The problem is growing for the middle class," said Larry Tribe, who heads the U.S. Justice Department's Access to Justice Initiative.
Most legal-aid organizations, which provide free legal services to people at or near the poverty line, have cut back as they have absorbed cuts in the funding they rely on from governmental and private sources just as demand for their services has risen. The Legal Aid Society in New York City, for instance, this year lost nearly $1.8 million in funding from its budget of about $30 million because of state and city budget cuts.
"We can only help one out of every nine people who solicit our help," said Steven Banks, the head of the organization, which assisted about one in seven people who asked for help before the recession.
There are no comprehensive statistics on how many people represent themselves in court. But nationwide, 60% of state judges reported increases in the number of civil litigants who appeared in court last year without counsel, the American Bar Association said in a July 12 survey. Parties were hurt by not having a lawyer, 62% of the surveyed judges said.
Katie Vickers, a 70-year-old Florida retiree who isn't a lawyer, said she agreed in 2008 to help a church friend petition for workers' compensation benefits. She said her friend, who didn't have an attorney, needed help typing legal documents and answering questions in court. The friend lost his claim, she said.
Now, Ms. Vickers is facing legal problems of her own. The Florida Bar filed a court petition in March claiming that Ms. Vickers had engaged in the unlicensed practice of law and should be fined $1,000.
The bar has a duty "to protect the public from incompetent or unethical representation," said Florida bar counsel Lori Holcomb. Ms. Vickers denied that she had practiced law and said she would vigorously defend herself--without a lawyer.

WASHINGTON--Capping an unusual sequence of events that for two days captivated politicians and pundits here, the White House apologized to a former Agriculture Department worker a day after she was fired over an allegedly racist speech first publicized by a conservative website.
The case of Shirley Sherrod, who had been the USDA's director for rural development in Georgia, highlighted the Obama administration's sensitivities to conservative political accusations in a heated political year.
It also became the latest episode to show how a toxic political atmosphere and a rapid-fire media can quickly turn a minor event into a media conflagration--in this case consuming a previously unknown official deep in the government's bureaucracy.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who made the decision to fire Ms. Sherrod Monday, offered "his personal and profound apologies" on Wednesday--as well as a new job.
The apology came after a review of an allegedly racist speech Ms. Sherrod delivered last year showed it didn't reflect a bias against whites but instead her view that poverty, not race, was at the root of rural problems.
Mr. Vilsack's apology was echoed by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, who said, "Ms. Sherrod is owed an apology. I will do so on behalf of this administration."
Mr. Gibbs went on to blame the media, factions on both sides of the political divide and "members of this administration" for overreacting to a selectively chosen snippet of Ms. Sherrod's March 2009 speech that was posted by conservative Internet activist Andrew Breitbart.
In the clip, Ms. Sherrod recounted a 1986 incident in which a white farmer had approached her for help saving his farm from foreclosure and she had handed him off to a white lawyer rather than giving his case her full attention.
In the full version of the speech, she said she saw the poor farmer, Roger Spooner, mistreated by his lawyer, stepped in and worked to save the Spooner farm. Mr. Spooner backed up that version of events and credited Ms. Sherrod with saving his farm.
Mr. Breitbart and some other conservative activists have argued that the Obama administration is insufficiently sensitive to bias against white people, citing the recent federal lawsuit challenging Arizona's new immigration law, among other instances.
After the NAACP last week accused elements of the tea-party movement of racism, Mr. Breitbart posted the snippet of the Sherrod speech on his website, biggovernment.com.
Mr. Vilsack said Wednesday he responded rashly after reading a transcript of the Breitbart clip. For the past 18 months, the USDA has been settling tens of thousands of discrimination suits against it. He said he wanted to show it wouldn't tolerate discrimination in any form.
When Ms. Sherrod was fired Monday, the White House expressed support for the move. By Tuesday night, however, the White House was demanding Mr. Vilsack reconsider the decision. By Wednesday, much of Washington was begging forgiveness, and the NAACP said it had been snookered by conservatives.
"Race has become infused in American politics to a degree we hoped would not happen with Obama as president," said Abigail Thernstrom, a political conservative and vice chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.
The election of the first African-American president in 2008 initially triggered a surge of positive feelings about race relations. Immediately after the 2008 vote, nearly half of white voters and three-quarters of black voters said they expected race relations to improve during the Obama presidency, according to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
After Obama had spent a year in office, Pew conducted a poll that found that 54% of blacks still believed the Obama presidency had improved race relations. Only 32% of whites said that, and 15% said it had made relations worse.
Even Mr. Breitbart said on MSNBC that he felt bad for Ms. Sherrod--not because of his role he played in the drama, but because the administration went after her and not the NAACP for its allegations.
In an unusual bit of televised theater Wednesday, Ms. Sherrod watched Mr. Gibbs live from the CNN studio in Atlanta as he issued his apology. She responded, "You know it makes me feel better. This shouldn't have happened. It took too long but it makes me feel better."
She also said she was considering Mr. Vilsack's offer of a new job.

WATERBURY, Conn.--Chloe Ottman, 16 years old, was strangled to death at the foot of a giant cross looming over this city of 107,000 people.
One week later, some Waterbury residents are looking warily at the crime's setting: Holy Land U.S.A., a park built by a devout Catholic, John Greco, in the 1950s. The park drew busloads of tourists before closing in 1984 for a redesign and renovations. Mr. Greco, who had been an attorney, died two years later and left Holy Land to an order of nuns, who never reopened it. The nuns have been considering selling the 17.7-acre parcel of land dotted with religious symbols and replicas of biblical scenes.
It was here that police say Ms. Ottman arrived on the evening of July 15 with a friend, Francisco Cruz. Police said Mr. Cruz, 19, delivered a detailed and gruesome confession Saturday of raping and killing the young woman.
According to a sworn confession by Mr. Cruz that was released by police, Mr. Cruz and Ms. Ottman walked into the park with four cans of a caffeinated malt liquor called Joose. They headed for the peak of the hilltop park, where neighbors and city officials say area teenagers have been hanging out for years. On their way up, Ms. Ottman and Mr. Cruz passed fraying replicas of Bethlehem and Jerusalem. They likely passed the "Bethlehem Our Hope" sign and a headstone inscribed with the words "Jesus is Condemned to Death."
At the end of their walk, the pair came upon a clearing at the top of the hill. Above them was the giant cross, at least 50 feet high, lit up by floodlights. Below was a sweeping view of Waterbury.
"How could you do something like this in a place like this?" said James Zimmerman, Ms. Ottman's step-grandfather. He used to live below the park and pick blueberries that grew there.
"No Trespassing" signs mark the park's entrance, but there's nothing keeping visitors from walking around the gate and up into the park. Two nuns, members of the Catholic order Religious Teachers Filippini, which owns the site, live just outside the gate. Betty Jean Takacs, the head of the order, said the members are "very upset" by the murder. The group for some time has been reviewing all of its landholdings, including Holy Land, to decide whether it should sell some of them. It did not give any indication of its plans for the land, which is valued at $1.24 million, according to city records.
On the night of the murder, Mr. Cruz made sexual advances toward Ms. Ottman, according to the confession police say Mr. Cruz signed. Ms. Ottman rebuffed him, telling Mr. Cruz that she had a boyfriend. In the confession, Mr. Cruz describes how he raped and murdered Ms. Ottman.
Mr. Cruz ignored Ms. Ottman's protests, the confession says, and kept trying to grab her. Ms. Ottman got angry and swung her elbow. She hit Mr. Cruz in the face and knocked off his glasses. "I got so mad at her," Mr. Cruz told police, according to the confession. "I hate when people hit me on the face."
Then he strangled, raped and murdered Ms. Ottman, police say. Mr. Cruz is charged with capital felony, murder, sexual assault and strangulation. He could face the death penalty if convicted.
Mr. Zimmerman and other family members on Tuesday drove to Holy Land U.S.A.'s chained-up gate, where mourners had set up a makeshift memorial of photographs, candles and notes.
City officials say they don't know what will happen to Holy Land. There have been efforts to restore the park or develop it, but they never got off the ground. Steve Gambini, an aide to Waterbury's mayor, said he remembers growing up in the heavily Catholic city when Holy Land was still open. Families would head to the park after Sunday Mass. Since then, the city's Catholic population has shrunk as the number of Evangelical Christians, fueled partly by immigration, has grown, Mr. Gambini said.
Since it closed, he said, the city's residents have had a largely sentimental relationship with the park and its large cross, which is visible from I-84.
Questions about the park's future have to start with the order of nuns, Mr. Gambini said. "We're more than happy to sit down with them at any time and have those discussions," he said.
Waterbury police say they've received fewer complaints about people trespassing in the park in recent years. They say it's no different from other wooded parks that can sometimes be magnets for illicit behavior after dark.
"This is an isolated incident," police Capt. Christopher Corbett said. "This is not indicative of any widespread problem up at Holy Land."

Fiorina should be long shot; But voters' anti-Washington mood may be working in her favor

Abstract: Fiorina would ban abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when pregnancy endangered a woman's life -- a stance that pits her against even the majority of Republican voters, according to the Field Poll. Fiorina supports more offshore oil drilling, the Iraq war, the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and Arizona's new law targeting illegal immigrants.

Full text: Californians normally wouldn't elect a Carly Fiorina to the U.S. Senate or any high office.
The conservative Republican, most specifically, opposes abortion rights. "I'm a proud pro-life conservative," she says.
But that's an alien position to most California voters and the opposite of her liberal Democratic opponent, Sen. Barbara Boxer. "Pro-life" has been red meat for Boxer for decades.
The nonpartisan Field Poll on Wednesday confirmed this state's unwavering support for women's choice on abortion. An overwhelming majority of voters who were interviewed, 71%, said they favored either keeping the current law as is or making abortions easier to obtain.
Fiorina would ban abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when pregnancy endangered a woman's life -- a stance that pits her against even the majority of Republican voters, according to the Field Poll.
The last "pro-life" candidate to win a top-of-the-ticket race in California was the first George Bush in 1988. And that's only because he had been local hero Ronald Reagan's vice president.
But this, of course, is not a normal election year. Voters either are struggling financially or are worried they soon could be. California unemployment is hanging above 12%.
It's possible that stands on so-called social issues, even abortion, will not provide the litmus tests for voters that they did in Boxer's past reelection snoozers.
The three-term incumbent faces her toughest fight since she first was elected to the Senate from the House of Representatives in 1992 over conservative commentator Bruce Herschensohn. That was "the year of the woman." This is the year of the grump.
The latest Field Poll shows Boxer with a narrow lead, 47% to 44%, a tiny gain since March.
But the key for poll director Mark DiCamillo is Boxer's rising negative image.
Throughout her career, the Democrat's image has been fairly positive, the pollster notes. But earlier this year it began to turn negative. And among likely voters, opinions of her currently are 41% favorable and 52% unfavorable -- troubling numbers for an incumbent.
Far fewer voters know enough about political newcomer Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief, to offer an opinion. But among those who do, her image is positive -- 34% favorable, 29% unfavorable.
Boxer's job performance rating also is negative: 42% approval, 48% disapproval. In January, it was positive.
"Barbara Boxer hasn't changed her stripes," DiCamillo says. "What is it this year that has affected her job ratings so heavily?"
The veteran pollster answers his own question:
"Republicans were taking shots at her in the [GOP] primary. But I also think there has been a change in the political backdrop in which voters are appraising Boxer. Part of it has to do with policy coming out of Washington."
Yes, Californians support President Obama's healthcare plan, DiCamillo says, but "generally there's a mind-set that the deficit is becoming a bigger problem and the stimulus bill contributed to larger debt.
"There's a sense by voters that government has overreached and is trying to do too much, that government shouldn't be in this expansive mood anymore. There's a greater sentiment for retrenching.
"And that cuts against Barbara Boxer. She's someone who has always promoted expansion of government services. It's the political headwind she faces."
The pollster adds that Boxer "is much more vulnerable this year because her numbers are negative, and voters are much more in the mood for reining in government than they ever have been in the past.
"To me, the most important thing to remember in the race is that Fiorina is not that well known. And yet, she's close to Boxer. And I find that really eye-opening. What it comes down to is a yes-or-no vote on Boxer. And voters are divided."
The job of Boxer's strategists, of course, is to make sure that the election does not become a referendum on the incumbent, the economy or even the president, although Obama remains popular in California.
The Field Poll found that 54% of voters approve of Obama's job performance; 39% disapprove. That's despite the finding that 53% believe the country is "seriously off on the wrong track." Only 33% think it's "going in the right direction."
"This is going to be a choice between two people"-- Boxer and Fiorina -- says the Democrat's campaign manager, Rose Kapolczynski. "The overwhelming issue is jobs and the economy. But voters also want to know that they're electing someone to a six-year term who is in touch with their views on the issues."
If voters look beneath the superficial slogans and sound bites, they will see that the candidates hold sharply contrasting views.
Fiorina supports more offshore oil drilling, the Iraq war, the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and Arizona's new law targeting illegal immigrants. Boxer opposes all.
Boxer favors a national ban on assault weapons, the president's timetable for troop withdrawal in Afghanistan, the federal stimulus package and California's anti-global-warming program to curb greenhouse gases. Fiorina opposes all.
Curiously, Fiorina campaigned on the far right in the primary and really didn't need to. She wound up winning easily. Since then, she hasn't put much effort into veering back toward the center, except for flip-flopping Tuesday in favor of extending jobless benefits to the long-term unemployed.
"She's personally pretty conservative," says her deputy campaign manager, Julie Soderlund. "People find that refreshing. She's not going to try to be something she's not."
But is she electable in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 45% to 31% and another 20% are left-leaning independents? Not normally. But conceivably this year.

Full text: The economic downturn has left more Americans with the daunting prospect of fighting court battles without a lawyer.
A growing number of people have found themselves in court facing costly financial proceedings such as declaring bankruptcy, fighting foreclosure and litigating employment fights. Adding to the challenge, for many: The high cost of legal representation often prompts them to go it alone.
Jillian Edgar of Brooklyn, N.Y., is one example. The 32-year-old, who says she has been unsuccessfully looking for work since October, is fighting an eviction notice that claims she owes more than $2,800.
Last week in Kings Country Housing Court, she said she didn't know the steps to take to qualify for free legal aid. Still, she said, "I think I can handle myself." Her plan: to say that she withheld rent because her apartment had fallen into disrepair.
Legal experts say many people are likely losing claims and paying penalties they could have avoided with a lawyer at their side. Litigants often don't understand the sort of evidence they need to present in legal proceedings, said Florida state Judge Claudia Isom.
She said she has seen a jump in people defending against mortgage-foreclosure proceedings without the aid of counsel, for instance, and they are "definitely at a disadvantage."
"People will gather legal information from the Internet, from friends, or leaflets at a courthouse and think, 'I can play checkers, I'm ready,' " said Raymond Brescia, a professor at Albany Law School, who has written about tenants' struggles to afford legal representation. "But when they get to court they realize it's a game of three-level chess, and they don't have the first idea of what's happening."
Legal representation is expensive, and some critics say lawyers have created quasi-monopolies in some areas that raise the cost of their services.
"You can hardly find a lawyer who charges less than $150 per hour, which is out of reach for most people," said Gillian Hadfield, a law professor at the University of Southern California.
In many areas, from immigration and family law to bankruptcy and housing disputes, she said, nonlawyer specialists could be trained to provide useful legal assistance. But nonlawyers who represent clients in court or provide other legal help face prosecution for the unauthorized practice of law, a violation of state bar rules.
"The U.S. is unusual in how restrictive the rules are on who can give you assistance in court," Ms. Hadfield said.
Many who go without a lawyer are too well off to qualify for free legal aid, even if they can't foot the bill for private lawyers, attorneys said. "The problem is growing for the middle class," said Larry Tribe, who heads the U.S. Justice Department's Access to Justice Initiative.
Most legal-aid organizations, which provide free legal services to people at or near the poverty line, have cut back as they have absorbed cuts in the funding they rely on from governmental and private sources just as demand for their services has risen. The Legal Aid Society in New York City, for instance, this year lost nearly $1.8 million in funding from its budget of about $30 million because of state and city budget cuts.
"We can only help one out of every nine people who solicit our help," said Steven Banks, the head of the organization, which assisted about one in seven people who asked for help before the recession.
There are no comprehensive statistics on how many people represent themselves in court. But nationwide, 60% of state judges reported increases in the number of civil litigants who appeared in court last year without counsel, the American Bar Association said in a July 12 survey. Parties were hurt by not having a lawyer, 62% of the surveyed judges said.
Katie Vickers, a 70-year-old Florida retiree who isn't a lawyer, said she agreed in 2008 to help a church friend petition for workers' compensation benefits. She said her friend, who didn't have an attorney, needed help typing legal documents and answering questions in court. The friend lost his claim, she said.
Now, Ms. Vickers is facing legal problems of her own. The Florida Bar filed a court petition in March claiming that Ms. Vickers had engaged in the unlicensed practice of law and should be fined $1,000.
The bar has a duty "to protect the public from incompetent or unethical representation," said Florida bar counsel Lori Holcomb. Ms. Vickers denied that she had practiced law and said she would vigorously defend herself -- without a lawyer.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Capping an unusual sequence of events that for two days captivated politicians and pundits here, the White House apologized to a former Agriculture Department worker a day after she was fired over an allegedly racist speech first publicized by a conservative website.
The case of Shirley Sherrod, who had been the USDA's director for rural development in Georgia, highlighted the Obama administration's sensitivities to conservative political accusations in a heated political year.
It also became the latest episode to show how a toxic political atmosphere and a rapid-fire media can quickly turn a minor event into a media conflagration -- in this case consuming a previously unknown official deep in the government's bureaucracy.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who made the decision to fire Ms. Sherrod Monday, offered "his personal and profound apologies" on Wednesday --as well as a new job.
The apology came after a review of an allegedly racist speech Ms. Sherrod delivered last year showed it didn't reflect a bias against whites but instead her view that poverty, not race, was at the root of rural problems.
Mr. Vilsack's apology was echoed by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, who said, "Ms. Sherrod is owed an apology. I will do so on behalf of this administration."
Mr. Gibbs went on to blame the media, factions on both sides of the political divide and "members of this administration" for overreacting to a selectively chosen snippet of Ms. Sherrod's March 2009 speech that was posted by conservative Internet activist Andrew Breitbart.
In the clip, Ms. Sherrod recounted a 1986 incident in which a white farmer had approached her for help saving his farm from foreclosure and she had handed him off to a white lawyer rather than giving his case her full attention.
In the full version of the speech, she said she saw the poor farmer, Roger Spooner, mistreated by his lawyer, stepped in and worked to save the Spooner farm. Mr. Spooner backed up that version of events and credited Ms. Sherrod with saving his farm.
Mr. Breitbart and some other conservative activists have argued that the Obama administration is insufficiently sensitive to bias against white people, citing the recent federal lawsuit challenging Arizona's new immigration law, among other instances.
After the NAACP last week accused elements of the tea-party movement of racism, Mr. Breitbart posted the snippet of the Sherrod speech on his website, biggovernment.com.
Mr. Vilsack said Wednesday he responded rashly after reading a transcript of the Breitbart clip. For the past 18 months, the USDA has been settling tens of thousands of discrimination suits against it. He said he wanted to show it wouldn't tolerate discrimination in any form.
When Ms. Sherrod was fired Monday, the White House expressed support for the move. By Tuesday night, however, the White House was demanding Mr. Vilsack reconsider the decision. By Wednesday, much of Washington was begging forgiveness, and the NAACP said it had been snookered by conservatives.
"Race has become infused in American politics to a degree we hoped would not happen with Obama as president," said Abigail Thernstrom, a political conservative and vice chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.
The election of the first African- American president in 2008 initially triggered a surge of positive feelings about race relations. Immediately after the 2008 vote, nearly half of white voters and three-quarters of black voters said they expected race relations to improve during the Obama presidency, according to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
After Obama had spent a year in office, Pew conducted a poll that found that 54% of blacks still believed the Obama presidency had improved race relations. Only 32% of whites said that, and 15% said it had made relations worse.
Even Mr. Breitbart said on MSNBC that he felt bad for Ms. Sherrod -- not because of his role he played in the drama, but because the administration went after her and not the NAACP for its allegations.
In an unusual bit of televised theater Wednesday, Ms. Sherrod watched Mr. Gibbs live from the CNN studio in Atlanta as he issued his apology. She responded, "You know it makes me feel better. This shouldn't have happened. It took too long but it makes me feel better."
She also said she was considering Mr. Vilsack's offer of a new job.

Full text: WATERBURY, Conn. -- Chloe Ottman, 16 years old, was strangled to death at the foot of a giant cross looming over this city of 107,000 people.
One week later, some Waterbury residents are looking warily at the crime's setting: Holy Land U.S.A., a park built by a devout Catholic, John Greco, in the 1950s. The park drew busloads of tourists before closing in 1984 for a redesign and renovations. Mr. Greco, who had been an attorney, died two years later and left Holy Land to an order of nuns, who never reopened it. The nuns have been considering selling the 17.7-acre parcel of land dotted with religious symbols and replicas of biblical scenes.
It was here that police say Ms. Ottman arrived on the evening of July 15 with a friend, Francisco Cruz. Police said Mr. Cruz, 19, delivered a detailed and gruesome confession Saturday of raping and killing the young woman.
According to a sworn confession by Mr. Cruz that was released by police, Mr. Cruz and Ms. Ottman walked into the park with four cans of a caffeinated malt liquor called Joose. They headed for the peak of the hilltop park, where neighbors and city officials say area teenagers have been hanging out for years. On their way up, Ms. Ottman and Mr. Cruz passed fraying replicas of Bethlehem and Jerusalem. They likely passed the "Bethlehem Our Hope" sign and a headstone inscribed with the words "Jesus is Condemned to Death."
At the end of their walk, the pair came upon a clearing at the top of the hill. Above them was the giant cross, at least 50 feet high, lit up by floodlights. Below was a sweeping view of Waterbury.
"How could you do something like this in a place like this?" said James Zimmerman, Ms. Ottman's step-grandfather. He used to live below the park and pick blueberries that grew there.
"No Trespassing" signs mark the park's entrance, but there's nothing keeping visitors from walking around the gate and up into the park. Two nuns, members of the Catholic order Religious Teachers Filippini, which owns the site, live just outside the gate. Betty Jean Takacs, the head of the order, said the members are "very upset" by the murder. The group for some time has been reviewing all of its landholdings, including Holy Land, to decide whether it should sell some of them. It did not give any indication of its plans for the land, which is valued at $1.24 million, according to city records.
On the night of the murder, Mr. Cruz made sexual advances toward Ms. Ottman, according to the confession police say Mr. Cruz signed. Ms. Ottman rebuffed him, telling Mr. Cruz that she had a boyfriend. In the confession, Mr. Cruz describes how he raped and murdered Ms. Ottman.
Mr. Cruz ignored Ms. Ottman's protests, the confession says, and kept trying to grab her. Ms. Ottman got angry and swung her elbow. She hit Mr. Cruz in the face and knocked off his glasses. "I got so mad at her," Mr. Cruz told police, according to the confession. "I hate when people hit me on the face."
Then he strangled, raped and murdered Ms. Ottman, police say. Mr. Cruz is charged with capital felony, murder, sexual assault and strangulation. He could face the death penalty if convicted.
Mr. Zimmerman and other family members on Tuesday drove to Holy Land U.S.A.'s chained-up gate, where mourners had set up a makeshift memorial of photographs, candles and notes.
City officials say they don't know what will happen to Holy Land. There have been efforts to restore the park or develop it, but they never got off the ground. Steve Gambini, an aide to Waterbury's mayor, said he remembers growing up in the heavily Catholic city when Holy Land was still open. Families would head to the park after Sunday Mass. Since then, the city's Catholic population has shrunk as the number of Evangelical Christians, fueled partly by immigration, has grown, Mr. Gambini said.
Since it closed, he said, the city's residents have had a largely sentimental relationship with the park and its large cross, which is visible from I-84.
Questions about the park's future have to start with the order of nuns, Mr. Gambini said. "We're more than happy to sit down with them at any time and have those discussions," he said.
Waterbury police say they've received fewer complaints about people trespassing in the park in recent years. They say it's no different from other wooded parks that can sometimes be magnets for illicit behavior after dark.
"This is an isolated incident," police Capt. Christopher Corbett said. "This is not indicative of any widespread problem up at Holy Land."

Full text: Two federal lawsuits were filed Wednesday against the small town of Fremont, Neb., seeking to overturn a controversial ordinance banning illegal immigrants from renting homes or taking jobs.
Fremont, a rural town with a population of about 25,000, found itself at the front line of the immigration debate when it passed the law after a special election last month.
It was due to go into effect July 29, but a federal lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union seeks an immediate injunction while the legal battle is taking place. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund also filed suit against the city.
About 45 percent of the town's eligible voters turned out for the special election, approving the ordinance 57 percent to 43 percent. Supporters of the law said it was needed because illegal immigrants were taking away jobs from legal workers and because the federal government has refused to take sufficient action against illegal immigration.
The ACLU's lawsuit claims the law is unconstitutional because immigration policy is the responsibility of the federal government. It also states that the measure risks committing racial profiling and fanning discrimination.
"There's a very palpable fear that is being expressed by our clients on the ground already, asking if they should just move out of Fremont," said Amy Miller, legal director of ACLU Nebraska. "Nebraska doesn't need a law on its books that, like Arizona's, is completely out of step with American values of fairness and equality."
Miller was referring to an Arizona law that gives police the power to question anyone whom they have a "reasonable suspicion" is an illegal immigrant. The U.S. Justice Department has sued to overturn the law.
Fremont's immigrant population has grown over the past 20 years as foreign workers have been attracted by the meatpacking industry. According to census records for 2008, about 4.4 percent of its population was foreign-born.
Dean Skokan, Fremont's city attorney, said he could not comment on the suits because he had not yet seen them. He added that he expected to issue a statement Thursday.
City officials are bracing for the costs of fighting the lawsuits. Other towns whose immigration measures were struck down in the courts, such as Hazleton, Pa., and Farmers Branch, Tex., have spent millions in legal fees.
Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates tougher laws on illegal immigration, said the lawsuits were an attempt to "intimidate local governments from taking action."
This ordinance "wasn't just an act of the city council. This was the voters of Fremont saying they wanted to do this," he said.

Full text: The Obama administration had no choice but to challenge the constitutionality of Arizona's far-reaching immigration law, whatever the litigation's eventual outcome.
Our experiences administering the nation's immigration system, under Republican and Democratic presidents, have convinced us that the challenge to Arizona's statute is essential to clarify, once again, who in our federal system has responsibility for setting immigration policy.
At first blush, Arizona's approach may appear to be a rational response to its burdens as the key gateway for illegal immigration at the Southwest border. But since the mid-1800s, the Supreme Court has upheld and expanded the federal government's primacy in establishing and enforcing immigration policy. When Arizona lawmakers passed S.B. 1070, a significant challenge to this settled constitutional principle, they virtually guaranteed that the federal courts would have to judge the constitutionality of their actions.
Allowing states to set their own immigration policies fails to solve the overall problem of illegal immigration and violates the supremacy clause of the Constitution. The federal government can permit states and localities to act on its behalf in immigration matters, but it must expressly delegate that authority. To that end, Congress passed legislation in 1996 that allows the Department of Homeland Security to make agreements with states and localities -- called 287 (g)s for the applicable code section -- to assist in immigration enforcement.
DHS has signed more than 70 such agreements, including with the state of Arizona and some of its municipalities. This program, while controversial, appears to be constitutionally sound because it supplements -- not supplants -- federal authority based on a specific delegation. Arizona's controversial law, however, appears to go well beyond the intent of 287(g), asserting for itself even greater powers to fashion immigration policy. Its approach invites a patchwork of inconsistent state policies, with results as untenable as having states set their own defense or foreign policies.
Likewise, S.B. 1070 impedes the federal government's ability to meet law enforcement objectives set by Congress and the president to protect public safety broadly. Such duties require a coordinated federal system that reconciles competing demands with available resources and shifting priorities. In the 1990s, for example, immigration policy focused on strengthening border security. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, priorities shifted to national security targets. More recently, the administration has directed resources toward helping Mexico eliminate drug cartel violence. Immigration officials must be able to adjust enforcement priorities and practices in light of changing circumstances.
All Americans should demand that their government meet its constitutional responsibilities. But the remedy for failure or policy disagreements is not to ignore the constitutional principles that bind us. Rather, it is to secure accountability for government performance or changes through the ballot box.
The most important fact driving the Arizona action is a question: Why are an estimated 11 million people in this country illegally? It is not because they preferred to come illegally, with the inherent dangers of exploitation, uncertainty and even physical danger for themselves and their families. The simple answer is that our immigration laws provide inadequate legal avenues to enter the United States for employment purposes at levels that our economy demands. Congress has refused to deal with this reality for decades.
The mismatch is stark. Only 5,000 visas are available for low-skilled workers, whereas until 2008, the unauthorized population grew annually by about 500,000 mostly low-skilled workers. Even in this recession, more jobs are filled at high rates by immigrants, including unauthorized immigrants, than our outdated visa allocations can accommodate. A Mexican national, for example, would wait 10 years or more to get a visa under today's system. It is not surprising that we have so many unauthorized people among us because employers and workers obey market, not government, rules.
Tightening border controls, while essential, has exacerbated the problem. Today, our borders are more secure than ever -- so those here illegally stay because re-entry is perilous. Other perverse consequences will continue until the underlying causes of illegal immigration diminish. Calls for "enforcement first" may have political appeal, but they are unworkable without a simultaneous federal overhaul of our immigration laws that includes effective enforcement, legal immigration reform and legalization for unauthorized immigrants.
We sympathize with the public frustration reflected in Arizona's law. We hope it pushes Congress to reclaim federal leadership in addressing the nation's immigration challenges. However aggrieved Arizona may be, allowing states to set immigration policies violates established constitutional principles and fails to solve the overall problem. Any administration, Democratic or Republican, would have to challenge Arizona's statute. In court Thursday, the Obama administration is defending a core constitutional principle that makes it possible for immigration to continue to serve important national interests.
Doris Meissner and James W. Ziglar are senior fellows at the Migration Policy Institute. Meissner served as commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1993 to 2000. Ziglar, who is a member of the Arizona bar, served as INS commissioner from 2001 to 2002.

Uneasy in Arizona; Town shows how immigration law could play out, in ways large and small [Correction 9/1/10]

Abstract: A federal judge has scheduled a hearing Thursday on an Obama administration lawsuit, one of three challenging the Arizona law, which requires officers to check the immigration status of people they arrest or cite for any violation if they have "reasonable suspicion" the person is in the United States illegally. The troubled economy forced the state to clip Benson's budget, and unemployment, foreclosures and minor crime linked mostly to drug addicts has cast some gloom upon the city motto, "Hang out in Benson!" Some residents have come to associate a general sense of decline with illegal immigration, which is visible here in the desert litter of backpacks and water jugs, and in the crammed-full vans that drivers sometimes ditch along the highways, sending passengers fleeing.

Full text: Correction: A July 22 Page One article about how Arizona's new immigration law has affected the town of Benson misstated the number of federal lawsuits challenging the law. There are seven such suits, not three. (Published 7/23/2010) Correction: A July 22 Page One article about how Arizona's new immigration law has affected the town of Benson incorrectly described a car involved in a police stop as a Dodge Falcon. There is no such model; the Falcon was made by Ford. Police said the car pulled over was a Dodge, but they could not confirm which model. (Published 8/24/2010)
Paul Moncada, the silver-haired police chief of this highway town, spent a recent morning anxiously checking the TV for news about Arizona's controversial new immigration law, set to take effect in a matter of days.
He sifted through stacks of state training materials, which still left him with lots of questions. And he worried about the frustrated people in town who might sue him for not enforcing the new law well enough, the frustrated people in town who might accuse him of racial profiling and the thousands who cross the blazing desert around here and whose lives he is also duty-bound to protect.
"There's pressure from all sides, and I understand all the sides," said Moncada, 56, who grew up here and has served on the force 34 years. "I'm just telling my officers: Do your job. It's nerve-racking."
A federal judge has scheduled a hearing Thursday on an Obama administration lawsuit, one of three challenging the Arizona law, which requires officers to check the immigration status of people they arrest or cite for any violation if they have "reasonable suspicion" the person is in the United States illegally. The law has renewed the contentious national debate over immigration reform, sparked huge protests in Tucson and Phoenix and spawned the possibility of similar laws in other states.
Its effects have been somewhat quieter, if no less divisive, in Benson, a town of about 5,000 people, a third of Hispanic descent, about an hour's drive from the Mexican border. It is a tourist stopover and mostly working-class community of flat-roofed adobe homes, pebbly RV parks and more upscale enclaves such as San Pedro Ranches on the edges of town. And as elsewhere, the debate here has mingled with an already trying situation. The troubled economy forced the state to clip Benson's budget, and unemployment, foreclosures and minor crime linked mostly to drug addicts has cast some gloom upon the city motto, "Hang out in Benson!"
Some residents have come to associate a general sense of decline with illegal immigration, which is visible here in the desert litter of backpacks and water jugs, and in the crammed-full vans that drivers sometimes ditch along the highways, sending passengers fleeing. In that context, the new law has inspired feelings from profound unease to a kind of righteous victory, which often sort along ethnic lines.
"Amen" is what Danna Judd said when Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signed the law in April.
She and her husband, Bevin, a UPS salesman, moved from Tucson to a new house on 22 acres in San Pedro Ranches three years ago, but their rural-lifestyle fantasy was quickly spoiled. They found stashes of clothes when they were out for desert walks. They found a smuggler's van abandoned in their gravel driveway. More recently, they arrived home with their two kids from an evening baseball game to a scene of floodlights and U.S. Border Patrol agents scrambling across their property.
"My neighbor called and said they were chasing around 20 people," Bevin Judd said. They ushered the kids to bed, turned on all the lights and locked the doors.
Like many who grew up in Benson, Bevin Judd remembers giving bread and water to Mexican farmworkers who crossed through town when he was a kid. He remembers leaving doors unlocked, keys in the car. "But now it almost seems like there's a criminal element to it," he said. The sense that crime has increased with illegal immigration isn't supported by either local or statewide crime statistics, although that is difficult for some around here to believe.
"It makes you afraid," said Danna Judd, a deputy city clerk. "You don't know who is out there. Are they drug smugglers? Do they have guns?"
To the Judds' relief, the one person who definitely does have guns is their neighbor Bob Dekoschak, 62, who was cleaning out his horse barn in the late afternoon. The wind blew the chimes. His wife, Elise, arrived home from work, and they sat under ceiling fans in their library packed with James Michener novels and books on Latin American culture.
"When we were moving here, we talked to a friend who said, 'Oh, and how armed are you?' " explained Elise Dekoschak, 60, who works for the state government.
Bob Dekoschak, who works for an international software manufacturer, already had a 12-gauge shotgun, but he bought two more, along with a .357 magnum.
As the sun sank into the crumbled landscape, the Dekoschaks talked of feeling isolated from law enforcement, which is spread so thin. They talked about the things they blame, at least partly, on illegal immigration: the state's failing schools, the closed hospitals, strained local budgets. They question its comparative benefits of cheap lettuce and cheap houses that helped drive Arizona's boom years.
"When Brewer brought this forth, she did it for those of us on the front lines," Bob Dekoschak said. "Those of us armed. Those of us with illegals running through our yards. We can't keep placating the Hispanic community. What we need is a division of Marines . . . "
He paused. Elise held up her hand. "Wait," she said. "What's that?"
A chopping noise; a helicopter, they decided. Maybe Border Patrol.
In the police station, Moncada was listening to radio calls. An officer was investigating a burglary suspect; another was checking out a crystal-methamphetamine lab; a highway patrol officer had stopped two men in a car and needed a Spanish speaker.
"I guess that's me," said Moncada, one of two Hispanic Americans on the force of 16 officers. He walked out into the 105-degree noon and sped off in his gray Chevy.
"I don't know what it is," he said, gliding onto Interstate 10. "But if you work in the southern part of Arizona, you should speak Spanish."
At the scene, the patrol officer explained that he'd pulled over the burgundy Dodge Falcon for speeding and following another car too closely. The driver had produced a Mexican license and a proper visa. The passenger produced his legal resident card. But the car was not registered to them. And after Moncada asked a few questions, the two men's stories did not match.
Moncada watched the two men as the patrol officer searched the trunk, the door frames, the engine, shining his flashlight into its crevices. Nothing. They let the men go.
"I think he was running heat," the chief said of the driver, referring to a common smuggling tactic around here, in which one car distracts the police so others get through. He got back into his Chevy.
"With the new law," he said, rehearsing a future scenario, "nothing would have changed on that stop."
And for Moncada, at least, that is the irony of the new law: Although heightening fears and expectations, threatening lawsuits and creating confusion, it is unlikely to change much about how his officers do their jobs, he said.
Already, if they stop a speeding van and people bail out running, officers generally make the leap and call Border Patrol. The new law essentially requires that call, along with one to verify the immigration status of every local drug addict, drunk driver or shoplifter arrested after next Thursday, when the law takes effect, barring an injunction. Although the law might play out differently in other places, Moncada said, his police will not use it as an excuse to hunt illegal immigrants. As a practical matter, he and other chiefs said, they are simply too busy with regular crime.
"I really don't know if it will have any significant effect at all," the chief said. "Will it fill the jails? Probably not. Will it be a deterrent? Probably not."
He drove down Route 80, past a blur of beige desert, past the iron gate where some ranchers found a body a few weeks ago.
"The poor guy was just laid out there," Moncada said, pointing to the spot. "We didn't find any water jugs. No backpack. It was miserably hot that day, 109 degrees. You can only imagine what kind of death . . . "
When the new law was introduced, Melissa Herrera-DiPeso, who runs a real estate agency in town, interpreted it as a license for the police to racially profile Hispanic Americans. This was based upon her memories of growing up in Tucson, when some white parents didn't let their daughters play with her. In high school, she had a white friend who was not allowed to have a Mexican boyfriend. Now a successful, glamorous-looking woman with a son attending Stanford University, she has been forced to wonder again how others see her.
"My white friends say, 'Oh, Melissa, you're making such a big deal of it,' " she said, sitting in her office. "But they're white. They don't have to deal with it."
She, too, is afraid of drug-related violence spilling over from Mexico. And like everyone, she is hopeful that the controversy will push the federal government to deal with immigration reform, although realistically, she figures it won't. And so she worries, about news that a list of illegal immigrants was circulating in Utah, about a mood of vigilantism that she believes Arizona's new law has encouraged.
"There's so much anger and frustration," she said. "If this law doesn't work, what's next?"
Down a gravel driveway, behind a locked gate, a man who preferred that only his first name, Marco, be used, considered that question.
He arrived in Tucson seven years ago on a tourist visa, found work framing the new houses. He got a paycheck then and paid taxes. He brought his wife and two kids to join him, and they moved to Benson, where he works for a rancher.
"We're not just here to benefit," said Marco, 37. "We're also giving."
He rents a trailer where he sat down on an overstuffed couch in a room decorated with frilly maroon curtains, his son's baseball trophies, family photos, two paintings of Jesus and one of the Virgin of Guadalupe.
He is nervous about the new law, he said, and like everyone else, he is preparing.
He has gathered all the documents he can find in a desperate hope that they might satisfy police asking for papers: some invoices from a store he owns in Mexico; a letter of recommendation from his home town's mayor. He plans to fix the small crack in the windshield of the sedan he drives to work, an infraction that could lead to his deportation if the law takes effect. He will try to look friendly but unassuming.
"I always try to dress clean, not dirty, like I've been walking through the desert," Marco said. Still, he worries about what might happen.
"Maybe it was a mistake to bring my family here," he said. "If it gets too tough, I will go. Maybe California."

Abstract: Area Boy Scouts will be joining as many as 50,000 of their fellow Scouts from across the country for the National Jamboree next week in Virginia, expecting 10 days of adventure, a chance to earn coveted merit badges and to simply have fun. The Boy Scouts of America have been developing a camp near the New River Gorge in West Virginia that will allow for white-water rafting and other outdoor activities.

Full text: Area Boy Scouts will be joining as many as 50,000 of their fellow Scouts from across the country for the National Jamboree next week in Virginia, expecting 10 days of adventure, a chance to earn coveted merit badges and to simply have fun.
But their fathers know better.
"They're getting a lot of life lessons we want them to get exposed to, and they didn't even know it," said Tom Zedan of Potomac Falls, a scoutmaster who has three sons who have been Scouts.
And the jamboree, which starts Monday, will be a sight to behold: Fort A.P. Hill near Fredericksburg, where the jamboree has been since 1981, will be transformed into a fully functioning city that Boy Scout officials say will become the ninth-largest in Virginia.
The jamboree in 2005 at Fort A.P. Hill was marred by a fatal accident and the weather. Four adult troop leaders from Alaska were electrocuted when a metal pole they were carrying struck power lines as they attempted to pitch a dining tent. The heat of a particularly warm summer also led to Scouts suffering from heat exhaustion and dehydration.
Organizers said that blueprints for the event's layout do not allow for any setups under power lines. J. Randall Minchew, a scoutmaster from Leesburg, said there will be "copious" amounts of ice and water, and Scouts in his troop have been instructed to drink water at least once every 15 minutes.
Zedan said organizers have taken precautions to prevent similar incidents to those that occurred at the previous jamboree. "There are lessons in everything you do in life, and there were lessons learned at the last jamboree," he said.
The Boy Scout National Jamboree happens every four years, but for most Scouts, the chance for activities and camaraderie with troops from across the country is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The jamboree that would have happened last year was delayed a year to coincide with the centennial of Scouting in the United States.
As Scouting reaches that landmark anniversary in the United States -- Scouting began a bit earlier in Britain, around 1908 -- it's trying to remain relevant in a time when it seems most boys would prefer to play video games than explore the outdoors.
"We haven't fared well [because] we've been reluctant to embrace technology," said Bob Mazzuca, Boy Scouts of America's chief Scouting officer, the organization's equivalent to a chief executive.
But the Boy Scouts are trying to adapt, he said. The jamboree, for example, will involve more technology than it ever has, with an AM radio station and wireless Internet access. And the next generation of Boy Scout uniforms will have a pocket designed to store an MP3 player.
Mazzuca said Scouting's future will be about finding a balance in "learning how to use technology while engaging in healthy outdoor activities."
Although Scouting has evolved, much of the jamboree remains the same.
The first National Jamboree was supposed to take place in 1935, but the epidemic of polio among boys in the United States forced officials to delay the event. In 1937, the debut jamboree took place in the District, with the boys camping in tents that circled the Washington Monument. (The term jamboree, according to the official Boy Scout etymology, was coined by Boy Scouts founder Lord Robert Baden-Powell to mean a gathering of Scouts.)
This could be the last jamboree held at Fort A.P. Hill. The Boy Scouts of America have been developing a camp near the New River Gorge in West Virginia that will allow for white-water rafting and other outdoor activities. It will also give the organization more space and, ultimately, more control, because they will own the land on which the jamboree is taking place instead of the U.S. military.
The organization is unsure whether the new location, which will be called the Bechtel Family National Scouting Reserve, will be ready for the 2013 jamboree, but the event will permanently move to the new location as soon as it's ready.
For many attending this year's jamboree, Scouting has become a family tradition.
"My grandfather was a Scout; my father was a Scout," Mazzuca said. "By golly, my kids are going to be Scouts."
Andy Kossowski, a scoutmaster for the jamboree, was introduced to Scouting by his father, an immigrant from Poland who maintained a secret Scout troop after the Nazis outlawed Scouting. He formed another troop at the labor camp he was sent to by Nazis.
Zedan said that some of the "best memories I had in life with my father were through Scouting."
Some Scouts planning to attend were looking forward to gaining some of the same experiences.
Being a Boy Scout "keeps me involved and trying new things," said Dakota Snyder, 17, an Eagle Scout from Sterling. "I love the outdoors. I love to create memories and be with friends."
Garrett Pan, 17, an Eagle Scout from Great Falls, said his time in Scouting has taught him one thing he probably wouldn't have learned elsewhere.
"I'm a very big knot guy," he said. "I would not have learned that if I weren't a Boy Scout."
Garrett Fraino, a 14-year-old from Potomac Falls, said he spends too much time indoors. Scouting, he said, "gives me the chance to make my own fire, pitch a tent and relax."

Full text: Working for the federal government should not be hazardous to employees' health.
But when it is, Uncle Sam should not be as stingy as he was made out to be during a hearing Wednesday on Capitol Hill.
Leaders of employee organizations, including those representing baggage screeners and federal firefighters, provided one example after another of the government's failure to care, either promptly or at all, for federal workers who were injured on the job.
Consider these stories from Jon Adler, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association:
On Sept. 11, 2001, Secret Service Special Agent Mike Vaiani ran into the World Trade Center, attempting to rescue those inside. He seriously injured his neck, shoulders and back in the process.
First, the Labor Department's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs lost his file. Then he started getting dunned for unpaid medical bills.
"After enduring this miserable process," Adler told the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on the federal workforce, "Vaiani stated, 'I would rather run back into the tower while it's on fire than have to deal with the Department of Labor.' "
Postal Inspector Bill Paliscak went to the Brentwood postal facility in Northeast Washington when anthrax-contaminated mail was discovered in 2001. Paliscak became ill as a result of anthrax exposure. The compensation office initially denied his claim. It was accepted in May 2002, but not before his credit was ruined and his medical care was disrupted.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Tim Chard participated in the dismantling of 100 meth labs between 2000 and 2007. In 2008, he began to suffer from pain and other symptoms apparently connected to meth lab toxins. The compensation office rejected his claim, so the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association Foundation paid for him to enter a treatment program.
"The common denominator from these horror stories is the OWCP is unable to effectively process claims filed by injured law enforcement officers," Adler said. A denial of a claim, or delay in processing it, can exacerbate medical problems and financially ruin employees, he told the panel, because once they say a health problem is work-related, private insurance will not cover it.
Shelby Hallmark, director of the compensation program, testified before Adler spoke and did not respond to the specific examples Adler offered. Hallmark, in his prepared statement, said his office "is dedicated to promptly adjudicating claims, promptly paying medical bills and claims for compensation."
He told Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) that his office does not make payments while a claim is being adjudicated. For complicated cases, the agency's goal is to decide on a claim within six months, he said.
Of course, a complicated case might be one that involves a complicated and serious ailment that is expensive to fix. A six-month wait could be devastating in those circumstances.
Those complicated cases sometimes involve illnesses, such as cancer, that might have been caused when an employee came in contact with a toxin while working. These cases require lots of detailed medical evidence to establish the link between the illness and the job.
The claims acceptance rate for occupation illnesses was only 52 percent last year, compared with a 90 percent rate for traumatic injuries, such as being cut by work equipment, Hallmark told the panel.
The subcommittee's hearing comes two days after President Obama announced his POWER Initiative, an acronym for Protecting Our Workers and Ensuring Reemployment. He expects the program to reduce federal workplace injuries and cut lost time.
Obama cited more than 79,000 new claims and more than $1.6 billion in workers' compensation payments in fiscal 2009. "Executive departments and agencies can and should do even more to improve workplace safety and health, reduce the financial burden of injury on taxpayers, and relieve unnecessary suffering by workers and their families," he said.
Just before the hearing, the subcommittee held a business meeting where it approved legislation to enhance training for federal supervisors. Under the bill, supervisors would receive training within one year of entering their new positions and every three years after that.
The panel, chaired by Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.), also advanced legislation that calls on the Office of Personnel Management to use a different method to calculate payments by the cash-strapped U.S. Postal Service to the Civil Service Retirement System. After recalculating the payments, the legislation directs OPM to transfer any Postal Service surplus in payments already made to the USPS Retiree Health Benefits Fund.
Estimates of the surplus range from $55 billion to $75 billion.
Sound off about Sherrod case: Has the U.S. Agriculture Department'shandling of Shirley Sherrod -- firing her based on an edited video clip, then later apologizing and offering her another job -- reaffirmed your confidence that you can be heard by managers in this administration? Or has it made you feel less secure and more careful about what you might do or say?
E-mail your answer to federaleye@washingtonpost.com and include your full name, home town and the agency for which you work. We might include your response in Friday's Washington Post.

Full text: In the Bungalow Belt of northwest Chicago, houses sink into the morass of foreclosure every day, leaving behind boarded-up windows, scraggly lawns, plummeting home values and an unintended invitation for squatters to settle in.
This is life for residents in the old industrial enclave of the Belmont Cragin community, where a flood of more than 900 foreclosure filings struck last year, the second-highest rate in the city.
Federal aid has arrived to help neighborhoods around the city deal with the destructive effects of the measles-like spread of mortgage defaults. But not in Belmont Cragin, about eight miles northwest of the Loop and directly north of the Austin neighborhood.
In fact, the vast majority of neighborhoods north and northwest of the Loop, where nearly 9,100 foreclosure filings were made last year, find themselves left behind in the federally funded effort to offset the damage from foreclosures. Only 28 of the city's 77 neighborhoods -- most of them on the West and South sides -- are eligible for assistance from Washington's $6 billion Neighborhood Stabilization Program, from which $155 million has been allocated to the city of Chicago, largely to rehabilitate and resell abandoned homes.
Why? Because Belmont Cragin and many other neighborhoods north and northwest of the Loop suffered the untimely misfortune of tumbling headlong into the abyss of foreclosure too late in the crisis, after most of the funding had been committed to the early subprime loan fatalities of 2006 and 2007. In the last two years, foreclosure filings in Belmont Cragin exceeded 1,600, tripling the combined number of filings reported in the neighborhood in 2006 and 2007.
"It started here in late 2008, with people losing their jobs. Now you've got doctors, attorneys and self-employed people," said Liz Caton, director of counseling services for the Northwest Side Housing Center.
"We're all questioning why we weren't included," added Anne O'Doherty Kamykowski, executive director of the Belmont-Central Chamber of Commerce. "If you looked at what was going on with mortgages in 2006, you could see this coming."
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development oversees the distribution of cash from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, and communities apply for assistance. Chicago made two bids for funding.
Katie Ludwig, manager of the stabilization program for the city's Department of Community Development, said the city based its application on the percentage of subprime loans in a community, the potential economic damage from foreclosures and the number of completed foreclosures in 2007.
The West and South Side neighborhoods of Austin, West Englewood and West Pullman -- each of which receives assistance from the stabilization program -- were the first and hardest hit by the foreclosure boom in 2006 and 2007. Those three neighborhoods alone combined for more than 3,700 foreclosure filings during those two years.
Much has changed, though, since 2007, when nearly 13,900 foreclosure filings were recorded in the city. For one thing, filings leaped 65 percent in the next two years, and the crisis began to envelop higher-income individuals and neighborhoods.
Condominium foreclosures took root, hitting Rogers Park and West Ridge. The two neighborhoods had reported a combined 180 foreclosures in 2006. Last year, the number skyrocketed to 1,200. The effects of condominium foreclosures are obscured because, unlike a boarded-up single-family home, a condo that is largely empty shows few outward signs of distress.
While there has been talk in Washington of expanding the stabilization program, it is clear that the amount of money needed would not be nearly enough to address the galloping effects of mortgage defaults.
"The South and West sides had first dibs on this, and my guess is there were more problems in those areas, (but) we're experiencing a lot of problems," said Ald. Ariel Reboyras, 30th, whose ward includes part of Belmont Cragin and six other communities, some of which receive stabilization program funding.
"It's a good program," Reboyras said. "It's a drop in the bucket, unfortunately."
Reboyras said he keeps three weed whackers in his neighborhood office to tend to lawns of abandoned homes. David Potete, a pastor in Belmont Cragin, said he mowed a lawn on the street where he lives for more than a year.
"I've never seen anything like this. Every block seems to have seven or eight (foreclosed) houses on it," Potete said.
The accumulation of foreclosed houses is by no means unique to Belmont Cragin or the city of Chicago, where nearly 23,000 foreclosure filings were made last year, according to the Woodstock Institute, which tracks housing developments in the region. In the first half of this year, foreclosure filings in the six-county region topped 39,200, a 37 percent increase over the first half of 2009, according to the institute.
Foreclosure filings jumped 95 percent in Palatine during the first six months of 2010, according to Woodstock data. Foreclosures in Rolling Meadows increased 55 percent; in Hoffman Estates, 86 percent; and Crystal Lake, 75 percent, underscoring the reality that the foreclosure crisis is having a bigger impact in the suburbs.
"You're already seeing it in northwest Cook County, and you'll see more of it in DuPage, Lake and a lot of places that have not had high (foreclosure) rates," said Geoff Smith, senior vice president of the Woodstock Institute.
As foreclosure filings have mounted -- there were more than 11,100 in Chicago alone during the first half of the year -- Smith said the "shock value has worn off" with much of the public.
Belmont Cragin, which began stirring as a neighborhood in the 1830s after George Merrill opened a saloon at Armitage and Grand avenues, symbolizes the challenge that cities across the country face as the number of foreclosures grows. It struggles with high unemployment, stagnant or falling wages, and tight credit that discourages or stifles private investment.
Belmont Cragin, formerly an immigrant working-class neighborhood notable for small mom-and-pop storefronts on Belmont Avenue that sported signs in English and Polish, has substantially redefined itself during the last two decades. Hispanics, which comprised 30 percent of the population in 1990, now represent more than 65 percent of the 78,000 people living in the neighborhood, according to the Census Bureau. And even as property values skyrocketed in the mid-2000s, income levels stayed relatively flat, helping create a housing market that could not sustain itself when the subprime bubble burst.
"We have not hit bottom," said Art Neville, vice president and senior loan officer at Community Savings Bank, a local lender. "A 40 to 50percent drop in housing values is not unusual in Belmont Cragin. It's one of the more harder-hit neighborhoods."
Felix Ayala lost his $352,000 home earlier this year after living in it for seven years. The economic slump of late 2008 led to a dramatic cut in his work hours as a restaurant waiter. Ayala sought a modification in his loan agreement in early 2009, but the bank foreclosed on him.
Short of any unforeseeable new government assistance, the neighborhood's fortunes hinge on a substantial reduction in unemployment, which in Chicago is at its highest level in 25 years.
"People have lost jobs," Neville said. "We used to give loans partly based on overtime slips. Now overtime has gone away, and you're seeing people working 30 to 32 hours a week instead of 50 to 55."
The damage to the community is substantially covered up, due largely to pride and a concern about the negative effects abandoned homes have on adjoining properties. Neighbors mow the yards of those who have moved out.
Some things, though, are tougher to deal with, like the abandoned home on Mango Avenue, where neighbors say squatters moved into the basement.
In the meantime, foreclosure filings mount, documented by official notices in Chicago's Northwest Side Press. On any given week, foreclosures will consume a quarter to a third of the weekly's pages.

Full text: The bedraggled immigrants were picking their way through the boulders and scrub when a group of heavily armed men descended on them just short of the California-Mexico border.
They corralled them in a cave and pointed their guns at the 10 men and one woman.
These lawless badlands in the hills east of Tijuana have long teemed with bandits and rapists, but these criminals demanded only phone numbers. They started calling the immigrants' loved ones in Pomona, San Diego and Bakersfield, Calif.: Send us money or we'll shoot, they said.
The dayslong kidnapping ordeal in May illustrates what authorities say is a growing trend as roaming gangs of well-organized, heavily armed gunmen turn their sights on illegal immigrants, making a treacherous journey ever more dangerous.
In the rash of kidnappings, which began about two years ago, gunmen hold captives until family in the U.S. send wire transfers of up to $5,000 to accounts in Mexico.
Some immigrants are beaten; several have been killed, including a pair of brothers from Mexico City. Many straggle across the border and turn themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents. Others end up in migrant shelters in Tijuana, too frightened to report the cases to Mexican police.
Little was known about how the criminals operated until Mexican authorities dismantled two gangs in recent months, including the one involved in the May case, in which 11 suspects were arrested after a shootout and a wild foot chase through the hills.
The arrests provided authorities with a rare glimpse into criminal networks whose reach stretches from the border to cities across the U.S. and Mexico.
The gang was allegedly run by a career criminal from the state of Nayarit and included a former Mexican army soldier. They admitted kidnapping more than 100 immigrants over 18 months, holding them in remote caves, makeshift camps and ranches.
"We threatened the families that if they didn't pay we would kill the immigrants," said Jose Flores Romero, the alleged ringleader, in his statement to detectives, referring to the abductions in May.
Authorities believe several gangs continue to operate.
"They know all the trails leading to the border," said Fermin Gomez, a Baja California assistant attorney general. "They know exactly where they're going, how many are walking, and they're all intercepted."
The situation resulted from factors in the U.S. and Mexico that put increasing pressure on the traditional human smuggling groups in the area, according to authorities in both countries.
Organized-crime bosses in Tijuana, squeezed by a drug war, demanded higher payoffs, while U.S. authorities, adding fencing and staffing on the border, were making it more difficult for immigrants to get through.
With a smuggling infrastructure already in place, it was easy and profitable for criminals to switch to kidnapping. Federal authorities in the U.S. immediately noticed the trend. Many immigrants began showing up at the border seeking medical attention instead of eluding agents.
"They're traumatized," said Robert Rodgers, a supervisor for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego, which investigates smuggling groups in the area. "They jump the fence into the U.S. looking for help."
The journeys start out straightforward enough. In Tijuana, recruiters scour fleabag motels that house immigrants waiting to cross the border. Offering safe passage, the recruiters transport the immigrants to staging areas in the ranch lands east of the city. Many of the recruiters and drivers are women who bring along their children to put immigrants at ease.
At the staging areas, guides lead the migrants into the mountains, on well-worn paths, into the hands of gunmen.
"For the guides it's a win-win proposition: They don't have to cross the border, or risk being captured by the Border Patrol, and they still get paid," one Mexican federal agent said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the media.
The deception doesn't end there. One gang, arrested in April, would plant a member in the group of immigrants. When asked for a phone number, he would immediately provide it and be rewarded with good treatment. Other immigrants, seeking to avoid beatings, would do the same.

Full text: Author: James Webb
The NAACP believes the tea party is racist. The tea party believes the NAACP is racist. And Pat Buchanan got into trouble recently by pointing out that if Elena Kagan is confirmed to the Supreme Court, there will not be a single Protestant Justice, although Protestants make up half the U.S. population and dominated the court for generations.
Forty years ago, as the United States experienced the civil rights movement, the supposed monolith of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant dominance served as the whipping post for almost every debate about power and status in America. After a full generation of such debate, WASP elites have fallen by the wayside and a plethora of government-enforced diversity policies have marginalized many white workers. The time has come to cease the false arguments and allow every American the benefit of a fair chance at the future.
I have dedicated my political career to bringing fairness to America's economic system and to our work force, regardless of what people look like or where they may worship. Unfortunately, present-day diversity programs work against that notion, having expanded so far beyond their original purpose that they now favor anyone who does not happen to be white.
In an odd historical twist that all Americans see but few can understand, many programs allow recently arrived immigrants to move ahead of similarly situated whites whose families have been in the country for generations. These programs have damaged racial harmony. And the more they have grown, the less they have actually helped African-Americans, the intended beneficiaries of affirmative action as it was originally conceived.
How so?
Lyndon Johnson's initial program for affirmative action was based on the 13th Amendment and on the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which authorized the federal government to take actions in order to eliminate "the badges of slavery." Affirmative action was designed to recognize the uniquely difficult journey of African-Americans. This policy was justifiable and understandable, even to those who came from white cultural groups that had also suffered in socio-economic terms from the Civil War and its aftermath.
The injustices endured by black Americans at the hands of their own government have no parallel in our history, not only during the period of slavery but also in the Jim Crow era that followed. But the extrapolation of this logic to all "people of color"--especially since 1965, when new immigration laws dramatically altered the demographic makeup of the U.S.--moved affirmative action away from remediation and toward discrimination, this time against whites. It has also lessened the focus on assisting African-Americans, who despite a veneer of successful people at the very top still experience high rates of poverty, drug abuse, incarceration and family breakup.
Those who came to this country in recent decades from Asia, Latin America and Africa did not suffer discrimination from our government, and in fact have frequently been the beneficiaries of special government programs. The same cannot be said of many hard-working white Americans, including those whose roots in America go back more than 200 years.
Contrary to assumptions in the law, white America is hardly a monolith. And the journey of white American cultures is so diverse (yes) that one strains to find the logic that could lump them together for the purpose of public policy.
The clearest example of today's misguided policies comes from examining the history of the American South.
The old South was a three-tiered society, with blacks and hard-put whites both dominated by white elites who manipulated racial tensions in order to retain power. At the height of slavery, in 1860, less than 5% of whites in the South owned slaves. The eminent black historian John Hope Franklin wrote that "fully three-fourths of the white people in the South had neither slaves nor an immediate economic interest in the maintenance of slavery."
The Civil War devastated the South, in human and economic terms. And from post-Civil War Reconstruction to the beginning of World War II, the region was a ravaged place, affecting black and white alike.
In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt created a national commission to study what he termed "the long and ironic history of the despoiling of this truly American section." At that time, most industries in the South were owned by companies outside the region. Of the South's 1.8 million sharecroppers, 1.2 million were white (a mirror of the population, which was 71% white). The illiteracy rate was five times that of the North-Central states and more than twice that of New England and the Middle Atlantic (despite the waves of European immigrants then flowing to those regions). The total endowments of all the colleges and universities in the South were less than the endowments of Harvard and Yale alone. The average schoolchild in the South had $25 a year spent on his or her education, compared to $141 for children in New York.
Generations of such deficiencies do not disappear overnight, and they affect the momentum of a culture. In 1974, a National Opinion Research Center (NORC) study of white ethnic groups showed that white Baptists nationwide averaged only 10.7 years of education, a level almost identical to blacks' average of 10.6 years, and well below that of most other white groups. A recent NORC Social Survey of white adults born after World War II showed that in the years 1980-2000, only 18.4% of white Baptists and 21.8% of Irish Protestants--the principal ethnic group that settled the South--had obtained college degrees, compared to a national average of 30.1%, a Jewish average of 73.3%, and an average among those of Chinese and Indian descent of 61.9%.
Policy makers ignored such disparities within America's white cultures when, in advancing minority diversity programs, they treated whites as a fungible monolith. Also lost on these policy makers were the differences in economic and educational attainment among nonwhite cultures. Thus nonwhite groups received special consideration in a wide variety of areas including business startups, academic admissions, job promotions and lucrative government contracts.
Where should we go from here? Beyond our continuing obligation to assist those African-Americans still in need, government-directed diversity programs should end.
Nondiscrimination laws should be applied equally among all citizens, including those who happen to be white. The need for inclusiveness in our society is undeniable and irreversible, both in our markets and in our communities. Our government should be in the business of enabling opportunity for all, not in picking winners. It can do so by ensuring that artificial distinctions such as race do not determine outcomes.
Memo to my fellow politicians: Drop the Procrustean policies and allow harmony to invade the public mindset. Fairness will happen, and bitterness will fade away.

Full text: About two dozen demonstrators protested outside the Illinois Republican Party headquarters in downtown Chicago on Wednesday as part of a nationwide campaign to bait elected officials into pushing for legal immigration status for millions of students in the country illegally.
As frustration has mounted over the lack of federal immigration reforms, so have the tactics of immigrant activists. Thirty undocumented students from Chicago and elsewhere were arrested in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday after staging sit-ins outside the offices of several legislators.
In what has become a political dance over the volatile issue of "Dream Act" students -- those who were brought into the country by their parents and seek a path to citizenship -- the demonstrators in Washington were not placed in custody by federal immigration officials.
Instead, they were charged with civil disobedience and released by Capitol police, with court hearings pending for those misdemeanor violations, said Sgt. Kimberly Schneider, a spokeswoman for the federal police department.
An official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement acknowledged that the department was aware of the protests but said the agency's focus is on deporting felons and other criminals who pose an immediate threat to American society.
"In a world of limited resources, we're focusing on the really bad actors," said ICE spokeswoman Gillian Brigham.

Lawyers representing the Obama administration argued in federal court Thursday that Arizona's contentious illegal-immigrant law would violate the U.S. Constitution by usurping federal authority over immigration, an assertion denied by attorneys for Gov. Jan Brewer.
In a separate hearing earlier Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union and a coalition of civil-rights groups argued against the law, which is scheduled to take effect July 29.
Both the administration and the ACLU are asking a judge to block the measure pending a final court hearing.
The law requires police to question people they stop about their immigration status if "reasonable suspicion" exists that they are in the country illegally. It makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally.
Attorneys for the state, who attended the hearing in a packed Phoenix courtroom, argued that the lawsuits should be dismissed because the state law wouldn't pre-empt federal immigration law or promote racial profiling.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton is expected to make a decision within days.
Whichever side loses is likely to appeal to the U.S. Ninth Circuit of Appeals.
Arizona, the busiest corridor in the U.S. for smuggling drugs and people, is home to about 450,000 undocumented immigrants.
Ms. Brewer signed the bill law in April to crack down on illegal entries and crime associated with it, which the state says is a burden on its resources.
During the first hearing, Judge Bolton suggested the possibility of a partial injunction, in which some of the law's tenets would be struck down and others upheld.
For example, legal experts say that the judge could enjoin the section of the law that makes it a crime to work in Arizona without legal status, or the one that bans solicitation of work on the streets, as day-laborer immigrants typically do.
ACLU attorney Omar Jadwat said the law's provisions were meant to work in tandem to compel undocumented immigrants to quit the state.
He said he hoped the court would block the "unconstitutional and dangerous law from moving forward."
The judge's decision is likely to be closely scrutinized by legislators in other states that are considering similar statutes.
"The real question going forward is what states can do" to address immigration, said Carissa Hessick, an associate professor of law at Arizona State University.
"The federal government is saying: 'We should have sole control.' The state is saying there is room for us to do things, too," Prof. Hessick said.
Arizona's law faces seven legal challenges.
Last week, Judge Bolton heard a lawsuit brought by David Salgado, a Phoenix police officer who claimed the legislation would put him in an untenable bind: Enforcing it could expose him to lawsuits for engaging in racial profiling while refusing to do so could cost him his job.

Full text: Every time a customer buys some of the large fabric tote bags from the Dollar Store at 43rd Avenue and Thomas Road, Najmuddin Katchi sees another piece of his business vanish.
The purchase of the briefcase-sized shoulder bags means that another one of Katchi's customers, mostly Latino immigrants, is packing to leave the state before what is touted as the nation's toughest law against illegal immigrants takes effect July 29.
Katchi's store isn't the only business suffering. The vast shopping center that holds his small shop is almost empty. The Food City supermarket closed this spring. Then the furniture shop. Then the pizzeria.
The giant apartment complex across the street, once brimming with tenants, is two-thirds vacant. Katchi is behind on his rent.
"The business is broken," said Katchi, who has operated his shop at this intersection for 14 years. "After the 29th of July, what happens? Maybe I have to close the store."
For the last 20 years, Arizona has been one of the fastest-growing states in the nation. It depends on an expanding population to power its economy, which relies heavily on the construction of new houses.
At the corner of 43rd and Thomas, it's hard to determine how much of the neighborhood's woes stems from Arizona's immigration laws and how much from the state's economy, battered by a once red-hot housing marked that cooled.
Katchi's revenue was already sagging before April 23, when Gov. Jan Brewer signed SB 1070 into law. Since then, sales have plummeted.
In adopting the legislation the state embarked on a grand experiment -- trying to drive out hundreds of thousands of its residents by what the law calls "attrition through enforcement."
The law requires police to check the immigration status of people they lawfully stop and also suspect are in the country illegally. Civil rights groups and the Obama administration have sued to stop the law from taking effect, and a federal judge heard arguments in the case Thursday.
The departure of illegal immigrants, proponents of SB 1070 argue, can only help Arizona's economy.
"As long as there are legal Arizona residents scrambling for jobs, a slow, steady attrition of low-wage, government-educated illegal aliens is a beneficial facet of the law," said Bob Dane, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, in Washington, which argues for stricter immigration standards and estimates that illegal immigrants cost Arizona taxpayers $2.5 billion annually.
But it's hard to get solid data on illegal immigrants and the economy.
A 2007 report from the Congressional Budget Office that reviewed 29 studies -- but not ones from advocacy groups like FAIR -- found that illegal immigrants place a "modest" burden on state budgets.
Even people whose families use government services worth more than what they pay in taxes still help the economy, said Judith Gans of the University of Arizona's Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy. In a 2008 study, she found that Arizona immigrants contributed $29 billion annually to the state economy, representing about 8% of its activity.
When immigrants leave, Gans said, "stores experience dramatic drops in sales. Apartment owners who rent to immigrants have high vacancy rates and risk losing their buildings. Legal workers or renters or consumers don't generally step in quickly enough to prevent these businesses from experiencing real additional hardship."
At 43rd and Thomas, such short-term economic perils are no abstraction.
"If people don't come here, I don't make money and I don't pay taxes," Katchi said.
The junction of two six-lane thoroughfares, 43rd and Thomas lies in the heart of immigrant Phoenix, a blue-collar mass of ranch homes and strip malls known as Maryvale.
No one has measured the effect of SB 1070 on businesses, or the number of immigrants it has prompted to leave Arizona. But merchants say the repercussions are clear -- not just in how the legislation has prompted many families to leave the state, but in how it has scared others enough to curtail their regular activities.
"The economy's already bad, but on top of it [SB 1070] is like a bullet in the head to us," said Osameh Odeh, 35, whose Eden Wear clothing store was empty one recent afternoon. "People don't come out of their houses anymore."
Odeh has laid off workers and doesn't pay his utility bills until the day they come due. He's not sure he can stay open and notes that the effect spreads well beyond the rough-and-tumble streets of Maryvale. A resident of the middle-class suburb of Gilbert, Odeh has cut back his purchases at home.
"If my son wants a toy, I can't afford it," he said.
Edgar Vela lives in another comfortable suburb, but his ability to spend money at home hinges on the success of his Salvadoran restaurant at 43rd and Thomas, La Pupusa Loca. He just closed his neighboring bakery last week and has laid off six employees. His daughters, both doctors, now come in on weekends to work the floor.
"People used to feel secure here; they'd come in, spend two, three hours," said Vela, sitting in his mostly empty restaurant, lined with mirrors and a full bar. "Now they eat and run."
He recalled one recent evening when two families were eating dinner. Their cellphones rang. Friends were alerting them that Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- strongly disliked in the area for his targeting of illegal immigrants -- had sent deputies to raid a nearby car wash. The families quickly asked for their checks, paid and ran from the restaurant.
Last month, a bank foreclosed on a rental house Vela owns nearby; it's one of three vacant homes on a short block. The families there told Vela that the breadwinners had been arrested by Arpaio's deputies, and they could no longer pay the rent.
Some of those leaving are U.S. citizens or legal residents who believe that all Latinos in the state are already being targeted by police. Vela, for example, said he had been stopped by police while driving to his restaurant "more times than I can count."
Faviola Davenport, 42, owns 3Girlz Retail across the street from Vela's restaurant. Davenport, who emigrated legally from Mexico 23 years ago, expects she will close the shop next month. In the small space, crammed with phone cards, mattresses and purses, Davenport said that if the law takes effect she will probably abandon Arizona as well. Her three adult daughters and their families -- all U.S. citizens -- are thinking of following her.
SB 1070's supporters say legal residents like Davenport have nothing to fear from the law, which bans racial profiling.
But this year, Davenport said, she was stopped by a police officer on her way to work. She said the officer did not believe she was in the country legally and warned that he could refer her to immigration authorities for deportation.
"They don't want Mexicans," she said. "So we'll leave."

Full text: A federal judge on Thursday expressed skepticism about the constitutionality of a key part of Arizona's controversial immigration law, but did not say whether she would prevent the measure from taking effect next week.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton said during a hearing that the provision that makes it a state crime to lack immigration documents apparently conflicts with a Supreme Court ruling that says states cannot create their own immigration registration systems.
John Bouma, a lawyer representing Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer in the seven lawsuits seeking to block implementation of the measure, tried to convince Bolton otherwise. Then he gave up.
"I didn't have the feeling I persuaded you last week either," he said, referring to similar arguments on another lawsuit.
Bolton did not issue a ruling or indicate when she would decide whether to issue an injunction to stop the main parts of the multifaceted law from taking effect July 29. Both sides agree that some technical parts of SB 1070 are constitutional, and Bolton said she would not strike those.
The judge honed in on one sentence in the law that requires everyone who is arrested to have their immigration status checked with the federal government before release. She questioned whether this would apply to arrests for minor, nonviolent misdemeanors that usually do not require jail time.
She also sharply questioned another part of the law that allows police to arrest anyone they believe has committed a crime that could lead to their removal from the country. Bolton said that such a complex determination is usually made by an immigration judge.
Still, Bolton seemed sympathetic to other parts of the law, including one that makes harboring or transporting an illegal immigrant a state crime. She noted that Phoenix is a hub of human trafficking. "Isn't it a public safety and welfare issue?" she asked.
The hearing involved the two biggest challenges to the measure -- one from a coalition of civil rights groups, the other from the Obama administration. Hundreds of protesters opposing the law marched outside the federal courthouse here.
Brewer signed SB 1070 into law April 23, saying Arizona's security was threatened by an influx of illegal immigrants from Mexico. Among its many provisions, the law requires police to determine the status of people they lawfully stop and also suspect are in the country illegally.
Numerous civil rights groups sued, as did the Obama administration, arguing that the measure improperly tries to regulate immigration, which is a federal responsibility. The law's defenders contend it merely mirrors federal laws.
In four hours of hearings, civil rights lawyers and federal attorneys denied that SB 1070 parallels federal law.
"The ultimate authority for enforcing [immigration laws] vests in the United States," said Edwin Kneedler, the deputy solicitor general. "The framers were very concerned that one member of the union could embroil the nation in a controversy."
That, he said, is what has happened with SB 1070. The law led to the cancellation of a conference between U.S. and Mexican governors and to threats from the Mexican government to withdraw cooperation on trying to crack down on border crime.
Bolton told Kneedler that he didn't need to bother talking about why the federal government viewed as unconstitutional the provision on not having documents. But she sharply questioned his contention that the state cannot tell its officers they must determine the immigration status of people they stop -- which is normally done with a call to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
Kneedler warned that if every state in the country adopted such a measure, it would create "a huge burden" on the federal agency.
Bouma said the new law merely directs local officers to help the federal government identify illegal immigrants. He contended that the Obama administration doesn't want to enforce much of the existing federal immigration law.
"I guess we have some explanation of why we have so many [smugglers] and aliens unlawfully here," Bouma said. "The federal government doesn't want them prosecuted and doesn't think the state should."
Government statistics show that the Obama administration has deported more illegal immigrants annually than the George W. Bush administration.
Arizona is the favorite crossing point for illegal entrants from Mexico, and even though the numbers have dropped off during the recession, fears of violence from Mexican drug traffickers persist. Bouma noted a sign the federal Bureau of Land Management recently posted in the desert 30 miles south of Phoenix:
"Danger -- Public Warning. Travel Not Recommended. Active Drug and Human Smuggling Area."
Bolton said she had seen pictures of the sign, heavily publicized by Brewer, and that it was "awful."
Brewer watched the last two hours of arguments, involving the Obama administration case, in the courtroom. Afterward, she gave a brief statement in which she praised Bolton's questions.
"I'm confident Arizona will prevail," Brewer said.

Abstract: Immigrant children crowded local schools, and their parents did not understand letters sent home in English and missed parent-teacher conferences and back-to-school nights. Hiring bilingual preachers and paying to keep chapels open for extra services would cost money, and it was assumed these immigrants would not be dropping much in the collection basket.

Full text: I became an English tutor by accident.
A few months out of college and feeling lonely and bored in a new town 3,000 miles from my family and friends, I volunteered to teach illiterate adults to read. It was something to do, somewhere to go other than my moldy attic apartment after work in a windowless office in Aberdeen, Wash., a foggy mill town of 16,000 people best known as the hometown Kurt Cobain slammed in his songs.
To my dismay, the volunteer coordinator at Grays Harbor Community College declined my offer. But she offered another option.
"What about the ESL classes?" she asked. "They're full and not many people want to tutor immigrants."
The only immigrants I knew well were college classmates who'd come on student visas. I was ambivalent about the idea of tutoring people who might be in the U.S. illegally.
Yet with nothing else to do in the evening, I agreed to try it. I quickly discovered that I had much in common with my new students. Like me, they were new to Aberdeen, new to Washington, still trying to figure out how to stay dry in one of the wettest places in the United States.
Aberdeen's immigrants do backbreaking work tearing salal from the rainforest floor and selling the vines ($50 for a day's work) to dealers, who send them to florist shops around the country. They pound Dungeness crabs with mallets and pluck their tender meat, or shuck oysters, or slice fish. Some man ocean-bound fishing boats with names like Tricia Rae and Crystal Marie.
By the time I arrived in Aberdeen in 2002, thousands of immigrants were sleeping stacked in apartments and trailers throughout Grays Harbor County. And there were tensions.
Immigrant children crowded local schools, and their parents did not understand letters sent home in English and missed parent-teacher conferences and back-to-school nights. Many out-of-work loggers resented their taxes going to pay for the kids to learn English.
The immigrants, many of them Catholic, wanted places to worship, but churches were reluctant to offer services in Spanish. Hiring bilingual preachers and paying to keep chapels open for extra services would cost money, and it was assumed these immigrants would not be dropping much in the collection basket.
In loud voices and on the opinion pages of the Daily World, the local paper, residents railed against the newcomers for not learning English. But as I soon found out, they were certainly trying.
Every evening, exhausted after a day of work, men and women came to a baby blue schoolhouse in Aberdeen to learn. I met them on the bottom floor: Level 1 English.
While the teacher taught salutations and vocabulary for clothing and food, I sat with the newest students and tried to help them sound out the letters to form the words in the language of their new home.
In my halting Spanish, I pointed out what I could: " Autobus. Tienda para comida. La escuela para tus ninos."
Sometimes they brought in documents -- job applications, bills, report cards -- and I tried to make sense of them. They laughed when my Rs fell flat and refused to roll, and I teased them about the "hobs" they were applying for.
We drew maps of grocery store aisles and took a field trip to Safeway. We studied bus routes and U.S. currency. For Thanksgiving, we baked a pumpkin pie.
They entertained me with stories of Mexico and introduced me to pan de dulce, and sent me messages from their new Hotmail accounts. I soon felt less alone, more rooted.
I usually walked the half-mile from class to my apartment, but on rainy nights, a beat-up van full of Mexican men never failed to stop on the road beside me. The backdoor would clang open and I would climb in, grateful.
After volunteering at the school for a couple of years, I arrived one evening to find the room nearly empty.
Immigration officers had stormed a fish processing plant that day, blocking doors and trapping scores of people with fish entrails on their hands and clothes. Some escaped. I don't know how. Others were loaded into trucks and taken away.
In class that evening, a man with pointy cowboy boots and a torn Nike windbreaker clacked over to me. I knew he had kids, two girls.
"Cat-lean," he said, searching my brown eyes. "How we know they no come here?"
I looked at the man, at all he had to lose. I had no words.
I could not promise him that our school would not be raided. I thought it was safe, but how could I really know? He would not be back to class, I assumed, but I knew he would be around, hunched over a bag of salal in the rainforest or dropping nets into the icy ocean in exchange for wages teenagers would turn up their noses at.
Although immigration raids and laws such as Arizona's SB 1070 push illegal immigrants underground, away from hospitals and banks and English classes, they do not force them out of the country. As long as there is hope -- jobs, education, a future for the children -- illegal immigrants, my students included, will stay.
An hour after arriving to a nearly empty class, I left school and stepped into the rain. I walked slowly, searching the darkened streets for a rusty van with a busted headlight.
I arrived home, soaked.

Full text: Addressing years of complaints about slow and inconsistent processing of visa applications for foreign performing artists, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services told arts groups this week that it was making an effort to speed up and improve its visa operations.
In a meeting on Tuesday in Washington, at the headquarters of the agency -- a division of the Department of Homeland Security -- officials said that standard applications for O and P visas, the types most often used by performers and athletes, would be adjudicated within 14 days. In some cases it has taken up to 120 days, arts groups say, with delays and demands for information that can seem arbitrary.
"What this means is that we are establishing for ourselves and our customers a standard by which our success and failure is to be measured," Alejandro Mayorkas, the director of the agency, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. (He was not at the meeting on Tuesday.) "One thing is to deliver the adjudications in rapid time because of the needs of the community, and another is to ensure that we achieve fair and just adjudications."
Artist advocates greeted the news as a positive but incomplete step toward fairness and efficiency in the visa system, which they say has become cumbersome and expensive to navigate, and has sometimes resulted in last-minute changes and cancellations.
"This to us represents a real breakthrough," said Heather Noonan, vice president for advocacy at the League of American Orchestras. "We are extremely hopeful that the changes that they have planned will result in improvements for international cultural exchange."
Managers, lawyers and other arts advocates say the problems began in mid-2001, when the government instituted premium visa processing, guaranteeing quick service at a higher fee. After that change, and with the security concerns in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, standard service seemed to lag, and puzzling variations in policy enforcement introduced a level of unpredictability that could wreak havoc with touring schedules.
For example, earlier this year the agency held up three applications for visiting musicians with the Chicago Opera Theater, requesting an unusual amount of evidence to corroborate the visa requirement that the artists have achieved sufficient renown. The company eventually went over its budget to hire an immigration lawyer, who got two of the musicians into the country at the 11th hour; the third had to be replaced, said Roger Weitz, the company's general manager.
Many arts groups say that under Mr. Mayorkas, a Cuban immigrant who was sworn in last August, their sometimes frosty relationship with Citizenship and Immigration Services has begun to thaw. Agency officials met with arts groups in April, and have recently begun soliciting comments about egregious experiences with the visa process.
Although the agency's policies have not changed, some have been clarified for the benefit of visa applicants, and Mr. Mayorkas insisted that the commitment is genuine.
"When I make a commitment," he said, "it is a benchmark that I am setting for our agency upon which the public should be able to rely."
Artist representatives say that more work needs to be done to streamline the process. "This is a great start but not where we would like to see things end up," said Tom Windish, a booking agent for independent rock bands.
And for fans, the bad news about cancellations is not likely to end anytime soon. On Thursday, for example, the reunited British ska band the Specials canceled its appearance next month at Central Park SummerStage. The reason: "visa issues."

Full text: The NAACP believes the tea party is racist. The tea party believes the NAACP is racist. And Pat Buchanan got into trouble recently by pointing out that if Elena Kagan is confirmed to the Supreme Court, there will not be a single Protestant Justice, although Protestants make up half the U.S. population and dominated the court for generations.
Forty years ago, as the United States experienced the civil rights movement, the supposed monolith of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant dominance served as the whipping post for almost every debate about power and status in America. After a full generation of such debate, WASP elites have fallen by the wayside and a plethora of government-enforced diversity policies have marginalized many white workers. The time has come to cease the false arguments and allow every American the benefit of a fair chance at the future.
I have dedicated my political career to bringing fairness to America's economic system and to our work force, regardless of what people look like or where they may worship. Unfortunately, present-day diversity programs work against that notion, having expanded so far beyond their original purpose that they now favor anyone who does not happen to be white.
In an odd historical twist that all Americans see but few can understand, many programs allow recently arrived immigrants to move ahead of similarly situated whites whose families have been in the country for generations. These programs have damaged racial harmony. And the more they have grown, the less they have actually helped African-Americans, the intended beneficiaries of affirmative action as it was originally conceived.
How so?
Lyndon Johnson's initial program for affirmative action was based on the 13th Amendment and on the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which authorized the federal government to take actions in order to eliminate "the badges of slavery." Affirmative action was designed to recognize the uniquely difficult journey of African-Americans. This policy was justifiable and understandable, even to those who came from white cultural groups that had also suffered in socio-economic terms from the Civil War and its aftermath.
The injustices endured by black Americans at the hands of their own government have no parallel in our history, not only during the period of slavery but also in the Jim Crow era that followed. But the extrapolation of this logic to all "people of color" -- especially since 1965, when new immigration laws dramatically altered the demographic makeup of the U.S. -- moved affirmative action away from remediation and toward discrimination, this time against whites. It has also lessened the focus on assisting African-Americans, who despite a veneer of successful people at the very top still experience high rates of poverty, drug abuse, incarceration and family breakup.
Those who came to this country in recent decades from Asia, Latin America and Africa did not suffer discrimination from our government, and in fact have frequently been the beneficiaries of special government programs. The same cannot be said of many hard-working white Americans, including those whose roots in America go back more than 200 years.
Contrary to assumptions in the law, white America is hardly a monolith. And the journey of white American cultures is so diverse (yes) that one strains to find the logic that could lump them together for the purpose of public policy.
The clearest example of today's misguided policies comes from examining the history of the American South.
The old South was a three-tiered society, with blacks and hard-put whites both dominated by white elites who manipulated racial tensions in order to retain power. At the height of slavery, in 1860, less than 5% of whites in the South owned slaves. The eminent black historian John Hope Franklin wrote that "fully three-fourths of the white people in the South had neither slaves nor an immediate economic interest in the maintenance of slavery."
The Civil War devastated the South, in human and economic terms. And from post-Civil War Reconstruction to the beginning of World War II, the region was a ravaged place, affecting black and white alike.
In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt created a national commission to study what he termed "the long and ironic history of the despoiling of this truly American section." At that time, most industries in the South were owned by companies outside the region. Of the South's 1.8 million sharecroppers, 1.2 million were white (a mirror of the population, which was 71% white). The illiteracy rate was five times that of the North-Central states and more than twice that of New England and the Middle Atlantic (despite the waves of European immigrants then flowing to those regions). The total endowments of all the colleges and universities in the South were less than the endowments of Harvard and Yale alone. The average schoolchild in the South had $25 a year spent on his or her education, compared to $141 for children in New York.
Generations of such deficiencies do not disappear overnight, and they affect the momentum of a culture. In 1974, a National Opinion Research Center (NORC) study of white ethnic groups showed that white Baptists nationwide averaged only 10.7 years of education, a level almost identical to blacks' average of 10.6 years, and well below that of most other white groups. A recent NORC Social Survey of white adults born after World War II showed that in the years 1980-2000, only 18.4% of white Baptists and 21.8% of Irish Protestants -- the principal ethnic group that settled the South -- had obtained college degrees, compared to a national average of 30.1%, a Jewish average of 73.3%, and an average among those of Chinese and Indian descent of 61.9%.
Policy makers ignored such disparities within America's white cultures when, in advancing minority diversity programs, they treated whites as a fungible monolith. Also lost on these policy makers were the differences in economic and educational attainment among nonwhite cultures. Thus nonwhite groups received special consideration in a wide variety of areas including business startups, academic admissions, job promotions and lucrative government contracts.
Where should we go from here? Beyond our continuing obligation to assist those African-Americans still in need, government-directed diversity programs should end.
Nondiscrimination laws should be applied equally among all citizens, including those who happen to be white. The need for inclusiveness in our society is undeniable and irreversible, both in our markets and in our communities. Our government should be in the business of enabling opportunity for all, not in picking winners. It can do so by ensuring that artificial distinctions such as race do not determine outcomes.
Memo to my fellow politicians: Drop the Procrustean policies and allow harmony to invade the public mindset. Fairness will happen, and bitterness will fade away.

Full text: The ever-evolving English language is expanding at warp speed these days.
On Saturday, Sarah Palin ignited the Twittersphere when she tweeted that "peaceful Muslims" should "refudiate" the mosque being built near the site of the twin towers in Manhattan.
(No, not a typo. She also used the word on a recent television show, Mediaite discovered.)
Apparently in response to ridicule for that tweet, Palin replaced it with one calling on folks to "refute the Ground Zero mosque plan," which made it pretty clear she was, for some reason, refuting to use the word "repudiate."
But that didn't quell what our colleague Matt DeLong described earlier this week as "the vicious Twitter-ribbing." So she tried again: " 'Refudiate,' 'misunderestimate' . . .," she good-naturedly tweeted. "English is a living language." And besides, "Shakespeare liked to coin new words too."
That comparison, naturally, set off more guffawing. The British were especially annoyed.
But words, as George Orwell opined, are critical in political discourse. Take, for example, the long-standing battle over the proper way to refer to folks -- Canadians, Irish, Mexicans -- who sneak into this country to work here. Those sympathetic to their situation say we should call them "undocumented workers." Those opposed insist they are to be called "illegal aliens."
So the blogosphere lit up Tuesday when Redding, Calif., blogger Bruce Ross posted a U.S. Forest Service news release on busts of marijuana growers in national forests that appeared to come up with a new term: "Displaced foreign traveler."
REDDING, Calif. -- A U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement Operation led to the arrest of an individual at an illegal marijuana cultivation site last week where 7,434 illegally grown marijuana plants were confiscated.
On Friday July 9, 2010 a marijuana eradication operation was conducted on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in Trinity County, south of Hayfork. . . . During the raid, a U.S. Forest Service K-9 team located Gauldry Almonte-Hernandez, a displaced foreign traveler from Michoacan Mexico, who had tried to flee the area and hide while officers were performing entry into the marijuana garden.
The defendant was arrested on federal charges in violation of Title 21 United States Code section 841, Manufacturing a Controlled Substance, if found guilty, he could receive a sentence of 10 years in prison.
"Displaced foreign traveler?" Ross blogged. "Makes it sound like he meant to go to Disneyland, got lost, and ended up at a pot plantation in the woods south of Hayfork."
Well, could be, if he was in Los Angeles and got turned around at that confusing cloverleaf off the Santa Ana Freeway and then went north on "the 5" for about 600 miles. No need for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to step in. Just call Travelers Aid.
We spotted what appeared to be a most interesting document on a colleague's desk. It was the National Republican Congressional Committee's "2010 Campaign Battle Plan," complete with a national map showing the "100 seats we are targeting." The map was stamped "CONFIDENTIAL," so we naturally gave it a long look-over.
"I've only sent a limited number" of these confidential letters, wrote the NRCC's chairman, Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), "to a select group of knowledgeable and experienced Republicans." The GOP needs to pick up only 39 of those 100 seats, he said, adding that a contribution of $39 "is just $1 for every seat we plan on picking up!"
The NRCC needs contributions to try to "keep pace with the Democrats -- trial lawyers, Big Labor bosses, radical environmentalists, and Hollywood leftists continue to shower Democrat candidates with cash," Sessions wrote. "We need you and every American who's fed up with one-party left-wing rule in Washington to stand up and fight with us."
The "plan for victory" is pretty straightforward, he explained. The focus will be on the "49 Democrats representing districts won by John McCain in 2008," Sessions said. (Win those, win the House, first subpoena goes to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack about firing Shirley Sherrod.)
"But please keep in mind," he wrote, "that your copy of our Campaign Battle Plan is CONFIDENTIAL -- it is intended 'for your eyes only' so please take care to not leave it lying around for others to see it."
Uh-oh.
Job Alert! The Agency for International Development is looking for a "Senior Gender Advisor" to work in beautiful downtown Kabul, Afghanistan, and, while the job is "mostly sedentary," you'll need to visit project sites in the countryside -- when military or other escorts and armored vehicles are available.
No, this is not to advise people who are conflicted about their gender and contemplating surgery. In English, this job would translate to overseeing the various health, education, business and other programs in Afghanistan specifically targeted to help women and girls. It pays up to $110,000 a year plus 35 percent hardship differential, plus 35 percent danger pay, or up to $180,000, which isn't too bad. You'll have two staffers -- a "Gender Specialist" and a "Junior Gender Specialist."
You'll need to speak a little Dari or Pashto and know your way around Afghan culture. You'll also need to squire about visiting congressional delegations and prepare lots of reports about the programs. How much sleep you get is problematic. Apply by Aug. 9.

Full text: The chilliness is understandable. When David Cameron, Britain's new conservative prime minister, met with Barack Obama this week, the president was also encountering his worst political nightmare. If Cameron succeeds, he will do more than save his ancient island from the economic fate of Greece -- he will provide a model for Republican victory in the 2012 U.S. presidential election.
In his passion for fiscal austerity, Cameron resembles the new breed of Republican governors for whom the art of governing begins with the discipline of accounting. He is a taller Mitch Daniels, a svelter Chris Christie. During the past fiscal year, Britain's deficit was larger as a percentage of its economy than Greece's. Cameron's June 22 emergency budget proposed the deepest, most sustained reductions in British spending since World War II. Health programs and foreign assistance are fenced off from cuts. But other government departments will see an average of 25 percent reductions over the next five years.
Bond investors and credit raters have responded positively to Cameron's austerity budget. When the cuts kick in, other responses could include strikes, demonstrations and riots.
This is a risky strategy in a nation where "socialism" is not an epithet but a founding commitment of one of the main political parties. But Cameron's austerity has the virtue of economic responsibility. It is easy to close a budget deficit with massive new taxes -- but it is also massively destructive to economic growth. So Cameron has proposed about four pounds in spending reductions for every pound in tax increases. A recent study of 44 major fiscal adjustments in developed nations since 1975 found that a one-percentage-point increase in taxes as a portion of gross domestic product cuts annual economic growth by an average of 0.9 percentage points. Reducing government expenditures by one percentage point, in contrast, increases average annual growth by 0.6 percentage points.
If Cameron's approach works -- dramatically cutting deficits without stalling economic growth -- it will be an obvious, powerful example for America and other nations.
But Cameron's progress offers two other lessons that some Republicans may be less willing to acknowledge.
First, Cameron's austerity measures have succeeded (so far) in the context of a coalition government with Liberal Democrats -- Britain's centrist third party. This alliance of the middle has made Cameron's government less dependent for support on the extremes of either party, resulting in a truce on divisive issues such as immigration and European integration. Cameron's alliance remains strong at the highest levels of political leadership. It will be tested as party activists from both coalition partners canvass against each other in next year's local elections and referendum on electoral reform.
A formal coalition government is not an option in America, which lacks a viable third party eager for power. But large, politically risky spending reductions will require spreading the responsibility and the blame beyond a single party. Some type of center-right alliance of fiscally conservative Democrats and Republicans -- a coalition of the complicit -- will be needed to act boldly and marginalize partisan extremes.
Second, Cameron makes clear that austerity alone is not a sufficient message for a political party. He calls deficit reduction his "duty." He refers to his social agenda -- the "Big Society" -- as his "passion." Cameron has paired his emergency budget with a series of measures designed to encourage volunteerism, empower local communities, create charter schools, reform welfare and fund the work of private charities. The problem with centralized, government-oriented policies, he argues, is not only their expense. They have "turned able, capable individuals into passive recipients of state help." The alternative is a "thoughtful re-imagination of the role, as well as the size of the state."
Cameron envisions a radical kind of devolution, not only to local governments but also to communities and individuals. Government, in his view, has an important role in building the Big Society, but it is mainly catalytic -- providing resources and authority to community institutions.
Critics in the Labor Party accuse Cameron of "cynically attempting to dignify its cuts agenda." But Cameron has been talking about these themes since well before the current financial crisis. The Big Society is not politically cynical, but it is politically smart.
Obama has every reason to fear the emergence of Cameron-style Republicanism. But American conservatives who respect Cameron's budget-cutting courage should also pay attention to his political insights. A successful austerity agenda depends on the assembly of an ideological coalition -- and it requires a domestic agenda more inspiring than responsible accounting.

Full text: Lawyers representing the Obama administration argued in federal court Thursday that Arizona's contentious illegal-immigrant law would violate the U.S. Constitution by usurping federal authority over immigration, an assertion denied by attorneys for Gov. Jan Brewer.
In a separate hearing earlier Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union and a coalition of civil-rights groups argued against the law, which is scheduled to take effect July 29.
Both the administration and the ACLU are asking a judge to block the measure pending a final court hearing.
The law requires police to question people they stop about their immigration status if "reasonable suspicion" exists that they are in the country illegally. It makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally.
Attorneys for the state, who attended the hearing in a packed Phoenix courtroom, argued that the lawsuits should be dismissed because the state law wouldn't pre-empt federal immigration law or promote racial profiling.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton is expected to make a decision within days.
Whichever side loses is likely to appeal to the U.S. Ninth Circuit of Appeals.
Arizona, the busiest corridor in the U.S. for smuggling drugs and people, is home to about 450,000 undocumented immigrants.
Ms. Brewer signed the bill law in April to crack down on illegal entries and crime associated with it, which the state says is a burden on its resources.
During the first hearing, Judge Bolton suggested the possibility of a partial injunction, in which some of the law's tenets would be struck down and others upheld.
For example, legal experts say that the judge could enjoin the section of the law that makes it a crime to work in Arizona without legal status, or the one that bans solicitation of work on the streets, as day-laborer immigrants typically do.
ACLU attorney Omar Jadwat said the law's provisions were meant to work in tandem to compel undocumented immigrants to quit the state.
He said he hoped the court would block the "unconstitutional and dangerous law from moving forward."
The judge's decision is likely to be closely scrutinized by legislators in other states that are considering similar statutes.
"The real question going forward is what states can do" to address immigration, said Carissa Hessick, an associate professor of law at Arizona State University.
"The federal government is saying: 'We should have sole control.' The state is saying there is room for us to do things, too," Prof. Hessick said.
Arizona's law faces seven legal challenges.
Last week, Judge Bolton heard a lawsuit brought by David Salgado, a Phoenix police officer who claimed the legislation would put him in an untenable bind: Enforcing it could expose him to lawsuits for engaging in racial profiling while refusing to do so could cost him his job.

Hearing begins on new Ariz. law; Justice Department cites 'irreparable harm' in immigration legislation

Abstract: Based on the Constitution's supremacy clause, it says federal law trumps state statutes. Because the federal government has "preeminent authority to regulate immigration matters," the government's lawsuit argues, the Arizona law must be struck down.

Full text: A federal judge pushed back Thursday against a contention by the Obama Justice Department that a tough new Arizona immigration law set to take effect next week would cause "irreparable harm" and intrude into federal immigration enforcement.
"Why can't Arizona be as inhospitable as they wish to people who have entered or remained in the United States?" U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton asked in a pointed exchange with Deputy Solicitor General Edwin S. Kneedler. Her comment came during a rare federal court hearing in the Justice Department's lawsuit against Arizona and Gov. Jan Brewer (R).
Bolton, a Democratic appointee, also questioned a core part of the Justice Department's argument that she should declare the law unconstitutional: that it is "preempted" by federal law because immigration enforcement is an exclusive federal prerogative.
"How is there a preemption issue?" the judge asked. "I understand there may be other issues, but you're arguing preemption. Where is the preemption if everybody who is arrested for some crime has their immigration status checked?"
At issue in Thursday's hearing, argued in a tan-colored "special proceedings" courtroom" inside the federal courthouse, was whether Bolton would grant a preliminary injunction to stop the law from taking effect while the federal lawsuit proceeds.
As dozens of protesters marched outside, the hearing marked the first round in the Obama administration's effort to stop the state's crackdown on illegal immigration. The tension in the courtroom reflected a broader national debate over what has become a politically divisive issue: whether police should have the power to question people they suspect are in the United States illegally.
"The regulation of immigration is unquestionably, exclusively, a federal power," Kneedler told a rapt courtroom. Brewer, whose fierce criticism of the federal lawsuit has helped her popularity at home, watched silently from the front row, drawing a "Good afternoon, Governor" from the judge.
Attorneys for Brewer argued with equal force that the legislation, scheduled to take effect next Thursday, is a legal expression of a sovereign state's right to secure its borders against a tide of illegal immigration. The federal government, the lawyers said, has failed to act.
"We keep hearing that we can't really do anything about these illegal aliens -- Arizona should just deal with it," said John J. Bouma, Arizona's lead attorney. "Well, the status quo is simply unacceptable."
The law, which Brewer signed in April, empowers police to question people they have a "reasonable suspicion" are illegal immigrants and to send them to federal authorities for possible deportation. President Obama has strongly condemned the law, and the Justice Department filed suit July 6, setting up an unusual clash between the federal government and a state over who should enforce the nation's immigration laws.
Bolton did not indicate how she might rule, saying only that she will take the matter "under advisement." But she did subject Justice Department lawyers to some pointed questions.
Kneedler responded to her query about why Arizona authorities don't have the right to be inhospitable to illegal immigrants by saying the law has given the state the power to enforce immigration law "in, frankly, an unprecedented and dramatic way."
"It is not for one of our states to be inhospitable in the way this statute does," Kneedler said, citing as his main argument the legal doctrine of "preemption."
Based on the Constitution's supremacy clause, it says federal law trumps state statutes. Because the federal government has "preeminent authority to regulate immigration matters," the government's lawsuit argues, the Arizona law must be struck down.
Bolton questioned key parts of that argument, especially relating to a section of the law that appears to require immigration-status checks if police stop someone for another law enforcement purpose and suspect the person is an illegal immigrant.
Kneedler said the conflict with federal law comes because the status checks are mandatory, which could lead to federal agencies being overwhelmed with deportation requests. Top officials at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, whose agents will handle most of the calls from Arizona authorities if the law takes effect, have said they will not necessarily respond to every call.
"There really is no flexibility," Kneedler said.
He added that the Arizona law might lead to police harassment of U.S. citizens and is threatening to harm vital cooperation along the border with Mexican authorities, who have strongly condemned the law. "These are very concrete harms, very substantial foreign policy concerns," he said.
Bouma ridiculed the foreign policy concerns.
"Foreign outrage doesn't make the law preempted," he said. He accused the Obama administration of ignoring requests from Brewer and numerous other governors for more help in securing the border.
"You can't catch them if you don't know about them," he said. "And they don't want to know about them."
Bolton is hearing six other lawsuits filed against the Arizona law. A former Arizona state court judge, she was nominated for the federal bench by Democratic President Bill Clinton, but legal observers say she is hard to pigeonhole ideologically.
Outside the gleaming glass-and-white iron courthouse, named for former Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor, an angry subtext reflected the divide over how to handle the nation's estimated 12 million illegal immigrants.
Opponents of the Arizona law clasped hands, prayed and held signs condemning it.
"The law is racist. The police are harassing us because of our brown skin," said Marta Calderon, who sat next to a painting of the Virgin Mary affixed with a sign saying "Stop SB1070," as the immigration law is known.
Nearby, Brandy Baron waved an American flag and expressed her support for the law and her "disgust" at efforts to overturn it.
"I am amazed that the Justice Department would have the nerve to sue us for trying to get laws that are already on the books enforced," she said.

Full text: The World Cup final between Spain and the Netherlands had a rating of 8.1 on ABC, the largest U.S. audience ever for a men's soccer game.
An 8.1 rating for any TV show is impressive these days. And this was for a telecast on a summer Sunday afternoon involving teams from countries that do not have huge immigrant populations in the United States. And the rating doesn't include all the U.S. viewers who watched the Spanish-language broadcast. The third-place match between Uruguay and Germany at the same time a day earlier drew a 3.1.
The significance of those numbers?
They don't mean soccer is on its way to challenge the big three U.S. sports -- football, baseball and basketball.
They do mean the World Cup definitely is a big deal to U.S. viewers, even after their own team is eliminated. That interest owes greatly to the ever-growing commitment to the event made by the Evil Empire (that's ESPN). The coverage from South Africa was exhaustive (and exhausting during the opening round, when there were three or four televised games a day).
They also mean Chicago needs to get aboard a boat it chose to miss last fall.
With those ratings and the measure of interest shown by the large number of U.S. fans who traveled to South Africa, the international soccer federation (FIFA) would be foolish not to give the 2022 World Cup to the United States when it awards the 2018 and 2022 tournaments Dec. 2. (England has been considered the 2018 favorite.)
And, if that happens, maybe Mayor Daley (if he runs and wins re-election next year) will get over his hissy fit of post-Olympic-bid pique that led the city not to submit itself as one of the possible host cities in a U.S. bid.
As in the case of Olympic bids, venue changes for the World Cup can be made after a city or country is picked.
Chicago will have to spend some money on Soldier Field to meet FIFA requirements, but the amount -- $1 to $2 million -- - is not a deal-breaker. And, the experience of the 1994 World Cup, when Chicago hosted six matches (including the opener), showed how much positive exposure (and tourism dollars) it can bring.
In fact, Chicago could benefit more from the World Cup than the World Cup organizers would.
Because Soldier Field is smaller than stadiums in all the other 18 host city candidates -- it has more than 10,000 fewer seats than all but two of the other stadiums currently in the mix -- there would be a substantial difference in ticket revenues, one of the organizers' primary revenue streams
The 1994 World Cup had nine venues. There could be a more the next time in the United States, given the number of new stadiums built since 1994.
Whether Daley or someone else is running the show, Chicago needs to be one of them.

Full text: A federal judge on Thursday expressed skepticism about the constitutionality of a key part of Arizona's controversial immigration law but did not say whether she would prevent the measure from taking effect next week.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton said during a hearing that the provision, which makes it a state crime to lack immigration documents, apparently conflicts with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says states cannot create their own immigration registration systems.
John Bouma, the attorney representing Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer in the seven lawsuits seeking to block implementation of the measure, tried to convince Bolton otherwise. Then he gave up.
"I didn't have the feeling I persuaded you last week, either," he said, referring to similar arguments on another lawsuit.
Bolton issued no ruling and did not indicate when she would decide whether to issue an injunction to stop the main parts of the law from taking effect July 29. Both sides agree that some technical parts of the law, SB 1070, are constitutional, and Bolton said she would not try to strike those.
Bolton focused on one sentence in the measure that requires everyone who is arrested to have their immigration status checked with the federal government before release. She questioned whether that would apply even to arrests for minor, nonviolent misdemeanors that usually do not require jail time.
She also sharply questioned another part of the law that allows police to arrest anyone they believe has committed a crime that would make them removable from the country. Bolton noted that is a complex determination usually made by an immigration judge.
Still, Bolton seemed sympathetic to other parts of the law, including one that made harboring or transporting an illegal immigrant a state crime. She noted that Phoenix is a hub of human trafficking. "Isn't it a public safety and welfare issue?" she asked.
Thursday's hearing involved the two biggest challenges to the measure -- one from a coalition of civil rights groups, the other from the Obama administration.
Brewer signed SB 1070 into law April 23, saying Arizona's security was threatened by illegal immigrants from Mexico. Among its provisions, it requires police to determine the status of people they stop and also think are in the country illegally.
Several civil rights groups sued, as did the administration, arguing the measure improperly tries to regulate immigration, a federal responsibility. The law's defenders say it merely mirrors federal laws.

Full text: Author: Daniel Ford
My father sailed to America in May 1927, and for the rest of his life he told how the Spirit of St. Louis flew low over the steamship one day while the captain sounded the latitude and longitude on the ship's whistle. True or not, the story is one that I savor as proof of the moment's significance. Merely to have been on the North Atlantic that afternoon, sharing it with Charles Lindbergh, was an honor worth telling for half a century.
Lindbergh's was indeed "The Flight of the Century," as Thomas Kessner titles his account of the transatlantic journey and its consequences for the pilot and his nation. Even as a oft-told tale (Lindbergh himself told it twice), the flight can bring tears to the eyes.
The impetus for Lindbergh and other aviators to attempt the unprecedented ocean crossing was a $25,000 prize offered by a French immigrant to the U.S., hotel owner Raymond Orteig, for the first person to fly nonstop between New York and Paris. The prize had gone unclaimed since it was established in 1919. By the mid-1920s, though, airplane technology had finally improved sufficiently to make transatlantic flight at least feasible for a pilot intrepid enough to try it.
Capturing the prize involved a race against time as well. Lindbergh's competitors, backed by substantial organizations, were readying large, multi-engine aircraft. They included polar explorer Richard Byrd, acclaimed in 1926 for being the first person to fly over the North Pole; he would be a passenger in a massive Fokker trimotor plane while professional pilots handled the controls. Lindbergh, by contrast, was a 25-year-old airmail pilot backed by hometown boosters who hoped to make St. Louis a hub for American air travel, as it had been for covered-wagon journeys the century before.
The boosters began with a pledge of $1,000 and eventually raised enough money to order a $10,580 aircraft from an obscure company in San Diego. The Spirit of St. Louis was essentially "a covered plank with fuel tanks," Mr. Kessner writes. Empty, it weighed less than a Honda Civic while carrying more than twice that weight in gasoline. The main fuel tank, in the front of the plane, was so big that Spirit had no windshield; to see what was before him, Lindbergh would use a periscope or stick his head out of a side window. To save weight, he would have no radio, fuel gauges, navigation lights or parachute; he even cut the margins off his charts.
In the weeks before the big flight, as his competitors experienced crashes and delays, Lindbergh put his new plane through its paces in California, then set out for New York. He shaved more than five hours off the coast-to-coast flying record in the process, making it from San Diego to New York, with a stop in St. Louis, in 21 hours, 20 minutes. Lindbergh's fame was growing even before he took off for Paris a little more than a week later: "No one ever more perfectly personified youthful adventure," gushed the New York Times.
Mr. Kessner does a good job of recounting the crossing, though since the only eyewitness was the pilot himself, the latter-day biographer can't bring much that's new to what was an essentially uneventful trip, aside from the feat itself. On his side, Mr. Kessner has the skills of a professional historian and a nice turn of phrase, as when he refers to Lindbergh's tube-and-fabric aircraft as "a little sprite of a plane." Unfortunately, he is apparently a bit of a tenderfoot when it comes to writing about aircraft construction and flight. He speaks of a pilot letting his airspeed drop and "freezing the engine," when what happens is that the wings stall and lose their lift. He calls the fuselage a "chassis" and the front cowling a "hood," as if Spirit were an earthbound automobile.
The author is clearly less interested in flight than in the significance of one particular flight. The bulk of the book concerns the effect of Lindbergh's achievement on the U.S. and its relations with the rest of the world. When the Spirit of St. Louis landed at Le Bourget field near Paris on the night of May 21, 1927, after 33 hours, 30 minutes, 29.8 seconds in the air, the sleepless Lindbergh was worried that the French might not let him stay overnight since he had no visa. He also had no change of clothes, no toothbrush and only 27 cents of ready money.
Lindbergh might have been even more concerned about his reception if he had known how unpopular his country was in France. At the time, nearly a decade after the end of World War I, American aid was feeding defeated Germany even as the U.S. was dunning France to repay its war debts. Much of France was even in a somber mood regarding the transatlantic-flight challenge: The country was considered the world's aviation leader, yet two of its own flyers had recently disappeared trying to reach New York.
All of that was forgotten in the delirium that greeted Lindbergh's arrival. So many cars set out for Le Bourget that the roads became extended parking lots and people ended up leaving their cars behind to continue on foot. An estimated 150,000 spectators were on hand when Lindbergh landed at 10:22 p.m.; they broke down the fences and overpowered the police and soldiers who tried to keep order.
Almost from the instant he touched down, Lindbergh was celebrated around the world, but his renown in America was unlike anything the country had ever seen. President Calvin Coolidge (who had earlier scoffed of aviation: "What was the use of getting there quicker, if you haven't got something better to say when you arrive?") sent a Navy ship to bring him home, though Lindbergh would have preferred to fly on around the globe. He was taken up by mentors including the banker Dwight Morrow, the philanthropist Harry Guggenheim and the publisher George Putnam. The Guggenheim Fund sent him and the Spirit of St. Louis on a tour of the U.S.; he visited 82 cities in 48 states and was seen by perhaps 50 million people, or 40% of the country's population. Through it all, the reserved Lindbergh was rarely seen to smile, but it didn't matter. Everyone adored him.
The adulation didn't stop at the border. When Lindbergh flew nonstop from Washington, D.C., to Mexico City in December 1927, he was greeted by a crowd of more than 200,000. (The new U.S. ambassador was the same Dwight Morrow, who in time became Lindbergh's father-in-law.) And so it went, through Latin America and the Caribbean, transforming the reputation of the U.S. in an era marked by resentment toward the big, muscle-flexing neighbor to the north. When Lindbergh stopped in Havana to address the sixth Pan-American Conference, newspapers described him as "more universally loved than any other person in the world."
Equally amazing, and perhaps more enduring, was Lindbergh's influence on the U.S. economy and especially on the aviation and airline industries. His countrywide tour persuaded thousands of communities to paint their names on factory or railway-station rooftops, essential guides to navigation in a day without radio beacons or global-positioning satellites. (When I began flight training in 1999, some of those municipal signs were still around, and even with a GPS receiver I wish they had all survived.) The future Trans World Airlines was virtually built on Lindbergh's association with the company. In large part because of Lindbergh mania, the output of aircraft manufacturers multiplied tenfold, as did their stock prices. As Mr. Kessner writes: "He became not only the voice and face but also the soul of American aviation."
The boom did not end well, as we know: The Depression took the wind out of the aviation industry until war production ramped up in 1940. Mr. Kessner goes quickly over Lindbergh's less happy years--the kidnapping and killing of his infant child in 1932; his strong early sympathy for Hitler's Germany; his leadership of the increasingly out-of-touch America First movement on the eve of World War II. But these matters lie outside the story of a flight and its aftermath.
It is probably wise of Mr. Kessner to have kept his story so tightly focused. I wish, though, that he had not left us with a puzzle. He tells us that when Lindbergh was received by King George V in London barely a week after the landing in Paris, the British monarch asked a question about the epic flight that was on everyone's mind: "How do you pee?" We are not privileged to know Lindbergh's answer.

FLORENCE, Ariz.--It's high noon for Arizona's new immigration law, and those on the front lines are anxiously preparing to face their new reality.
A group of deputy sheriffs gathered the other day in this dusty desert town to watch a video lesson on the intricacies of their sensitive new mission: nabbing illegal immigrants while writing tickets for routine infractions such as making a wrong turn.
Fifty miles away on the outskirts of Phoenix, Hispanic parishioners filed into St. Margaret Catholic Church to watch skits in Spanish dramatizing ways to dodge police questions about their immigration status. Among the advice they got: Give someone power of attorney lest they are suddenly separated from their children.
Amid the passions gripping the country about illegal immigration, the cram sessions are bringing what is a largely theoretical issue for many Americans to a visceral level here.
The Arizona law makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally. It requires police who stop people for routine things like running a red light to check their immigration status if there's "reasonable suspicion" they're in the U.S. unlawfully. If they can't produce proof they're here legally, the police can detain them while efforts are made to clarify their status.
The measure has been hailed in state opinion polls but denounced by the Obama administration, whose Justice Department is pressing a lawsuit that says the statute usurps federal authority over immigration. Other suits say it will result in racial profiling. Unless a federal judge now hearing some of the challenges issues a stay, the statute will take effect on Thursday.
Both sides are being urged to stay calm.
"Don't be frightened by it or run away from enforcing the law," Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu advised the deputy sheriffs assembled near his office. "Now that this is policy, we're on the hook."
"We should not panic," counselor Janette Leal told the illegal immigrants gathered at St. Margaret's. "At the same time, we can't pretend nothing is happening. We need to plan for the worst."
Some are. Thousands of illegal-immigrant families have left for other states. Boarded-up houses, shuttered stores and vacated used-car lots are ubiquitous in Hispanic enclaves. St. Margaret's has lost about 20% of its parishioners in recent months. At Park Village Apartments in Mesa, 30 of 120 units have been vacated since the law passed in late April.
Many Hispanic citizens and legal immigrants are worried, too. "This law opens the door for people like me to be harrassed," said Miguel Gomez Acosta, 32, a Lutheran pastor who has lived in the U.S. since he was eight and is a naturalized citizen. "I feel I need to carry my U.S. passport to prove my citizenship."
Anna Torres, a Mesa resident who isn't a legal immigrant, was holding a yard sale on a recent day before packing up her family to make a fresh start in New Mexico. "I've been here 18 years and I've never seen anything like this. We're being hunted," she said.
Supporters of the law deny that. "It's not racist. It's needed," said Kelly Townsend, President of the Greater Phoenix Tea Party. "We can't afford to continue to pay for people in our state that are not citizens. That's money that should be going to balance our budget."
Mark Spencer, president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, which lobbied for the law, said about 20% of inmates in Maricopa County jails are illegal immigrants, and "they are there because of conduct, not because of skin color."
The law prohibits the use of race, color or national origin as a basis for verifying an individual's immigration status. The video shown to deputies and police says time and again not to use skin color or accent as a basis for arrest.
Some officers found that advice insulting. "It's demeaning. We all know it's wrong to use racial profiling. We learned that Day One one in the academy," said Sgt. Hunter Rankin. "Law enforcement in Arizona is being dragged into the middle of a huge political battle."
The officers are being asked to walk a fine line. "Just because someone doesn't speak English doesn't mean you're arresting them," Sheriff Babeu told his deputies. "They could have a student visa or a work permit.'"
At the same time, the law allows officers to consider, in determining whether reasonable suspicion of being in the country illegally exists, a combination of factors such as whether a person struggles with English, appears nervous or is traveling in a crowded car.
The instructional video says officers can also consider whether an individual is in an area where illegal immigrants are known to congregate looking for work or is wearing several layers of clothes when it's hot, a sign he or she may have trekked through a chilly desert night to cross the border.
"The law befuddles cadres of attorneys," said Frank Milstead, police chief of the city of Mesa. "What do you think it does to officers? It sets them up to make mistakes."
Making a mistake is also what illegal immigrants fear. On a small stage at St. Margaret's, parishioners performed skits on how to interact with police. In one version, a driver admitted to the officer who stopped her that she lacked immigration documents. The children in the back seat confirmed to the officer that their mother was from Mexico. She was detained and the kids were left wailing.
In the second version, instead of answering the officer's question about her status, the driver tried to mollify him, saying: "I'm sorry I made a wrong turn. I'll accept a ticket." This time, the children shrugged when the officer asked them where their mother was from. Ultimately, in the skit, the officer wrote a ticket and let the driver go.
The moral is, "Don't lie to the police officer. Plead with him. Negotiate with him," said Blanca Hidalgo, who had been trained to lead the session by the Valley Interfaith Project, a coalition that works with immigrants. She said, "Don't give police any reason to stop you. Fix your broken taillights and windshields."
Before the lesson began, the coach invited participants to share their concerns. "Every single day, every time I get into the car I pray to God that my family will not be separated," said Gavril Vargas, a father of four U.S.-born children who has worked 14 years at the same construction company in greater Phoenix but has no legal status.
In the front row, Ariel Dominguez, a golf-course maintenance worker who took the day off to attend the workshop, summed up the sentiment: "We're desperate."
Why stay? "We're settled here. We have good jobs," said Mr. Dominguez, whose wife works at a seafood restaurant.
Ms. Hidalgo advised participants, if detained, not to sign any forms without an attorney present. In unison, the group practiced saying, "I choose to remain silent and I want to speak to my lawyer."
Later, Ms. Hidalgo reviewed a preparation packet given to everyone. It advised undocumented families to appoint a trusted U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident to tend to their children and personal affairs in case they were detained. The packet contained a form to grant someone power of attorney over a minor. "Sign them," said the coach. "You need to be ready."
The dossier of Cristina and Jose Sanchez is already complete. It holds copies of their three U.S.-born daughters' birth certificates, Social Security numbers and immunization records; the couple's Maricopa County marriage license; their taxpayer identification numbers issued by the Internal Revenue Service and tax returns for several years.
A small envelope contains their attorney's business card. On the couple's bank statement, Mrs. Sanchez has written the PIN to access the account.
"This is the life we built here, little by little," said Mrs. Sanchez, clutching the fat green file. Two friends who are American citizens, Karina and Michael Rodriguez, will keep a copy of the documents, which name the two as parties responsible for the Sanchez children if their parents are arrested.
On the enforcement side, Mesa Police Chief Milstead said one of his biggest concerns was that an undocumented immigrant stopped for a minor infraction, in a desperate attempt to avoid arrest, might "flee, fight" or even "kill a police officer."
He also worries that undocumented residents would refrain from reporting crimes out of fear they could be deported, compromising community safety.
Some officers on the front lines worry they could be sued over alleged profiling--or, alternatively, for allegedly failing to enforce the law.
They were warned in the training video to prepare for the scrutiny of activists. "I urge you not...to be baited by the questions that may be posed to you by individuals whose purpose is to find Arizona police officers discriminatory," said Brian Livingston, executive director of the state police association.
Arizona plans to show the training video, or at least key excerpts, to all 15,000 state peace officers. One part sure to be included is advice from Lyle Mann, executive director of the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board: "Act as if every act and word is being videotaped," he said.
"The entire country is watching to see how Arizona, and particularly Arizona law enforcement, responds," Mr. Mann added. "This state and each of you have now been thrust onto the national stage, and history will be made."

Too many Americans are out of work. We need to address their hardships with targeted stimulus initiatives such as extending unemployment benefits, which are a very small part of our current deficit. But we cannot continue to ignore our gargantuan longer-term structural deficits. These deficits will soar even after our economy is strong again, and they are the real threat to America's future. We must combine short-term stimulus with a meaningful plan to tackle our long-term structural deficits that would go into effect after our economy has recovered sufficiently.
People fret about the current public debt rising to 60% of GDP, which many economists believe should be the maximum debt level. But they ignore Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections that, under current policies, the public debt will reach a staggering 233% of GDP in 30 years and nearly 500% in 50 years.
This is an unthinkable and unsustainable path. In less than 50 years, for example, the CBO projects that interest payments on the national debt alone will represent nearly 20% of the entire U.S. economy and consume 100% of government revenues. This leaves not a penny for any government programs, including critically needed education, R&D and infrastructure. With plummeting savings rates, already 47% of the public debt is held by foreign nations. Borrowing trillions more from China, the Middle East and elsewhere will leave us more beholden to lenders whose interests may not align with our own. Given the growing concerns about the global debt crisis, we need to build confidence we are getting our fiscal house in order. This added confidence will help our recovery.
As the very lucky son of poor immigrants, I am also deeply concerned about preserving the social safety net for lower-income families. As we've seen in Greece, safety nets can be brutally shredded in times of fiscal crisis. If we act now, we can combine fiscal responsibility with social justice.
What specific reforms should be included in a long-term fiscal reform program? A plan will only inspire confidence and reach consensus if it confronts difficult issues that have been largely ignored. That means all options must be on the table. President Obama's bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform can play a key role in the development of such a plan.
Some have tax aversion syndrome--they have never met a tax increase they didn't do everything in their power to block. While I believe that spending cuts must play a lead role in any solution to our long-term structural deficits, the sheer magnitude of the imbalances requires revenue increases.
Ideally, the country should raise as much government revenue as possible from a progressive consumption tax. Such a tax can be designed so that it won't overly burden lower-income families but will raise significant revenues and increase our savings rate.
However, given political realities, it is not likely that we could enact a progressive consumption tax that would raise sufficient revenues to meet our needs. Therefore, I would initiate such a tax in conjunction with a simplified income tax (that would have far fewer corporate and individual credits and deductions)--thereby allowing for lower individual and corporate income tax rates.
Finally, we should implement a carbon tax that would reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lending, while improving the environment.
On the spending side, the country needs to address outdated and bloated programs. Why do we spend more on defense than the next 14 countries combined? We should reinstall the tight budget controls that were used successfully in the 1990s, such as caps on discretionary spending and strict pay-as-you-go rules.
Still, the brute fact is that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to account for 100% of CBO's projected long-term growth in spending (other than interest costs). With so many more elderly living much longer than ever, we have to ask: If all of us, including the relatively well off, are on the wagon, who is going to pull it? To meet these trillions of dollars of entitlement obligations, we would need to double federal taxes. Wouldn't that be generational theft?
In my view, any reforms to these vital programs should include reductions in benefits for better-off Americans, including options such as raising the payroll cap and making wage and price indexing of benefits more progressive. We should also gradually increase the retirement age for the able-bodied and index it to longevity.
The cost of health care is the most daunting and difficult challenge of our structural deficits. Medicare obligations, for example, are about five times the size of Social Security. To relieve the burden of health-care costs, we need to tackle the largely ignored systemic cost drivers, such as the fee-for-service payment system that encourages unnecessary and expensive procedures. Pilot programs made possible by the new health law can help determine reforms we should adopt and what effects they would have on costs and health outcomes.
There is no way we can simply grow out of the long-term fiscal crisis. The Government Accountability Office has projected that the economy would have to show double-digit growth in real terms for the next several decades. That's clearly impossible. We've run out of painless solutions, but to do nothing is to aid and abet a looming and most costly crisis.
Our short-term economic challenges are here and now, but our longer-term structural deficits can no longer be ignored. As an American Dreamer and a grandfather of nine, I believe that our nation can deal with both at the same time.

Abstract: Mr. Leach is wrestling with balancing risk levels at Citigroup, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by market value, and one that has managed to be a part of nearly every financial crisis in the modern era, including WorldCom, Enron and the still-smoldering mortgage crisis. For the first half of this year, the bank posted middling results in widely watched debt underwriting rankings, trailing Barclays PLC, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Deutsche Bank AG. Firms often are required to put up capital--taking on risk--to bring securities issues to the public.

Full text: Author: Carrick Mollenkamp
Brian Leach, chief risk officer at Citigroup Inc., knows well the downsides of risky bets. He paid for one of his own.
As an options trader for Morgan Stanley in 1992, Mr. Leach bet wrongly that European government bonds would track British government debt. He lost a half-year's worth of his trading profit after the surprise election of British Prime Minister John Major's Conservative party.
Now, he is trying to apply at Citigroup one lesson he learned from the incident: quickly cutting losses. "It really helped define for me what downsides could look like," he says--particularly from extreme events that disrupt historical pricing models.
Mr. Leach is wrestling with balancing risk levels at Citigroup, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by market value, and one that has managed to be a part of nearly every financial crisis in the modern era, including WorldCom, Enron and the still-smoldering mortgage crisis.
The current crisis saddled the bank with souring loans and securities. Mr. Leach is part of a team trying to sharply reduce the bank's holdings instead of trying to wait for loan values to rebound.
On July 16, Citigroup said it had sold $1.3 billion of delinquent mortgages in this year's second quarter. Mr. Leach has helped lead efforts to rid the bank of $104 billion of distressed assets and securities, including $8 billion of complex debt pools in recent quarters. There is much more to do: Citi must wind-down a $465 billion portfolio of businesses and troubled assets.
But changing a culture at a bank the size of Citigroup is no sure thing. "You've got to listen to your risk manager even when times are good," says David Hender, analyst at research firm CreditSights.
Citigroup could end up reining in risk too much and losing business as result. For the first half of this year, the bank posted middling results in widely watched debt underwriting rankings, trailing Barclays PLC, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Deutsche Bank AG. Firms often are required to put up capital--taking on risk--to bring securities issues to the public.
Citigroup spokesman Stephen Cohen said: "We seek to do transactions with appropriate risk measurements, managing our business for productivity and profitability and not market share."
Mr. Leach, 51 years old, was hired in February 2008 as Citigroup grappled with mounting losses tied to mortgage-debt pools that culminated in the November 2008 government bailout of the once powerful financial colossus.
He temporarily moved with his wife from his New Canaan, Conn., home to a Manhattan apartment to spend more time at Citigroup headquarters wrestling with the bank's mortgage exposure. He cleaned house, reshaping the risk group with a 13-member team of managers.
Mr. Leach is little-known outside of a tight-knit group of global risk managers, where he won respect after helping untangle hedge-fund Long-Term Capital Management in the late 1990s after it was battered by a wide range of bad derivatives and other bets that threatened Wall Street.
Raised in Weston, Mass., Mr. Leach was one of six children of a prominent orthopedist who has advised professional athletes, including the Boston Celtics. Mr. Leach learned about business from his grandfather, an English immigrant, who rose from an office boy at a mill to become a textile executive.
At Brown University, Mr. Leach excelled at wrestling in the 134-pound weight class, showing "good quickness," says his coach, Joe Wirth.
"In wrestling, there are multiple OK moves and one wrong move," Mr. Leach says. In risk management, "there are a fair amount of things that are actually OK but there is usually one thing that you can't do. And you've got to be able to understand what that is."
After working at Morgan Stanley and receiving a business degree from Harvard, Mr. Leach returned to Morgan Stanley where he advised clients on using derivatives to hedge risk such as movements in interest rates or oil prices. He later ran the firm's bond-options trading operation in London.
Mr. Leach's first financial-crisis lesson came in 1998. He was one of six bankers dispatched by Wall Street firms to Greenwich, Conn., to unwind Long-Term Capital.
Mr. Leach spent 15 months in Greenwich, along with other bankers and Long-Term traders unwinding thousands of derivatives positions without tipping off rivals to the positions. David Rogers, then a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who worked with Mr. Leach on the Long-Term Capital assignment, says: "We were constantly playing kind of a bit of a game with the Street."
Mr. Leach later left Morgan Stanley, following executives Vikram Pandit and John Havens to join their new hedge fund, Old Lane Partners LP.
In April 2007, Citigroup acquired Old Lane, setting the stage for Mr. Pandit to succeed Citigroup CEO Charles Prince in December of that year. The following February, Mr. Pandit named Mr. Leach Citigroup's chief risk officer.
Mr. Leach assigned new risk officials to Citigroup's businesses and asset classes. He and Citigroup's technology specialists designed a system to better see all exposure to assets at one time, such as real estate embedded in securities and home loans. Mr. Leach now can shock the portfolios to see how they would perform in different economic cycles, such as when home prices drop.
Mr. Leach grappled with Citigroup's ballooning exposures to its own mortgage assets as well as to other Wall Street firms. One competitor drew close scrutiny: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
In June 2008, Mr. Leach ordered that Lehman post collateral for $3 billion to $5 billion to bolster a lending agreement Citigroup had provided Lehman. Lehman officials asked for meeting with Citigroup officials, according to an internal Lehman memo later disclosed as part of a review of Lehman's eventual bankruptcy filing.
The memo indicates that a meeting was set in June 2008, just months before Lehman unraveled. "Lehman is very disappointed by Citi's knee-jerk reaction in tightening our intraday clearing lines. This reaction is contrary to Citi's Relationship Management's focus to increase operating revenues from Lehman. This decision was driven by Brian Leach."
Lehman ultimately agreed to post $2 billion to a callable account. For his part, Mr. Leach says banks needed to protect their finances while also servicing clients.
Mr. Leach increasingly worried that the banking markets could be hit by massive selling of souring assets. He flagged his concerns at a presentation in early fall 2008 in Switzerland at a meeting of central bankers, regulators and peers--well before many others grasped the scale of the problem, says attendee Peter Fisher, fixed-income chief at money manager BlackRock Inc. and a former New York Federal Reserve official who helped oversee Wall Street's Long-Term Capital rescue.
In September, Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection. Soon after, Mr. Leach was among a half-dozen senior officials that negotiated Citi's $20 billion bailout.
He concedes that someone again will trigger a money-losing trade. Then, unwinding the unprofitable position could be the right decision.
"In this business, you won't always get it right," Mr. Leach says. "And so the question is, did you do your preparation beforehand? Did you do the work beforehand? And when those things--all the best-laid plans go awry--how do you respond afterwards?"

Abstract: In one, a grand jury indicted four teenagers on multiple felony charges for a brutal April 5 beating but declined to include the hate-crime charges despite a police report alleging they said, "You are a [expletive] Mexican, we are going to beat you up." Others attribute the violence to young people taking advantage of day laborers, who often carry large amounts of cash and are afraid to report crimes to the police if they are undocumented.

One sign stands out among the postings for mammograms and English classes at an immigrant center in Staten Island.
"Have you been witness to any abuse on the street?" it asks in Spanish. "Have you been the victim of any abuse?"
Since April, Latinos have been the victims of seven robberies or attacks in Port Richmond that police have classified as bias crimes. That compares with one hate crime during the same time period last year.
Arrests have been made in three of the cases. In one, a grand jury indicted four teenagers on multiple felony charges for a brutal April 5 beating but declined to include the hate-crime charges despite a police report alleging they said, "You are a [expletive] Mexican, we are going to beat you up."
The numbers reflect a spike in bias-crime figures across Staten Island--21 so far this year, compared with nine during the same period last year--but authorities say that only in Port Richmond are all the victims Latino and the attacks close in vicinity to one another.
The targeting of Port Richmond is both unusual and alarming, said Inspector Michael Osgood, head of the New York Police Department's Hate Crimes Task Force. Police don't suspect the defendants are connected, but "all the defendants are operating by the same theme," Mr. Osgood said. "They're picking victims who are Mexican and they're attacking them and sometimes they're robbing them."
The attacks have left some Latinos in the area, most of them from Mexico, on edge. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Mexican Consulate have participated in community forums on the subject.
"I don't walk outside at night unless I'm with a friend," said Rogerio Vazquez, 46 years old. His arm was fractured and he suffered lacerations to his head in an April 25 attack. Police classified the attack as a hate crime and have charged a 19-year-old Asian woman and 21-year-old African-American man, who were also charged with an attack in April that was classified as a bias crime.
A grand jury didn't include the hate-crimes charges in an indictment. Both defendants have pleaded guilty to robbery charges.
Mr. Vazquez said he was hit on his arm and head with a baseball bat and fell to the ground. He was also robbed of $200 and his cellphone. A former painter, he now lives on money from El Centro del Inmigrante, a nonprofit serving the immigrant community, and donations from his friends until his arm heals and he can return to work.
Mr. Vazquez isn't alone. Alejandro Galindo, 52, goes to so many doctor's appointments because of his June 24 beating--which is being investigated as a bias crime--that he hasn't returned to work and continues to have blurry vision, his family says.
And Graciano Castillo, 49, says he suffered a broken jaw during a June 12 beating that he reported to police. Mr. Castillo said his attackers made anti-Mexican comments but says he didn't tell the police about them; he is from Peru.
Some attribute the hate crimes--in which most of the suspects are African-Americans--to economic tensions between two working-class populations.
"If you go to different businesses and look at who's doing the help in these stores, you will see they are Latino employees," said Edward Josey, president of the Staten Island NAACP. "You don't see any influx of blacks being employed in the stores. People might tend to feel that jobs they may have wanted are going to other people."
Others attribute the violence to young people taking advantage of day laborers, who often carry large amounts of cash and are afraid to report crimes to the police if they are undocumented.
"I don't see it as African-Americans are just targeting Latinos," said the Rev. Tony Baker, pastor of St. Philip's Baptist Church, a prominent African-American church in Port Richmond. "I think it's crimes of opportunity and preying on weaker people that you think may not report you or can't fight back."
Tensions over ethnicity and immigration are hardly new here. Port Richmond's downtown, once Staten Island's primary commercial district, turned into a ghost town in the 1980s. Shops boarded up, helping make way for drugs and prostitutes.
After Sept. 11, 2001, the community's once transient Mexican population began to plant roots because travel back and forth became more difficult. Now, the downtown is known as the "Little Mexico" of Staten Island. The General Store has a sign for leche and pan, milk and bread. Nate's Specialty Pharmacy notes in its window: "Hablamos Espanol." Nearby stores sell rosary beads, phone cards and Mexican candies.
Some immigrants say they feel they are targeted solely because of their race and are frequently subjected to verbal abuse, to which they have grown immune. Said Maria Morales, 48, who owns Los Potrillos Taqueria, one of the businesses targeted by a driver who drove his truck into three Mexican-owned businesses in 2008 and was charged with a bias crime, "It's not safe because I'm Mexican, I'm a target. There's not a lot of tolerance."
Ms. Morales said the number of hate crimes hasn't increased. "They just didn't report them before," she said.

In June of 1973, Daniel Schorr rushed onto the air for a "CBS Evening News" broadcast with a hot scoop: the contents of President Richard Nixon's "enemies list."
As he read off the list, Mr. Schorr recalled in a memoir, he was stunned when he got to No. 17: "Schorr, Daniel. Columbia Broadcasting System. A real media enemy."
The longtime newsman and commentator, who died at age 93 Friday after a brief illness, won Emmys for his Watergate coverage, scored the first U.S. TV interview with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and reported on the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall. Not long after he conducted the Khrushchev interview in 1957, Mr. Schorr was denounced in Pravda as a "provocateur" and not allowed back into the country.
In 1975, Mr. Schorr reported that the Central Intelligence Agency had conducted assassinations of foreign leaders. In a White House briefing, an infuriated former CIA director, Richard Helms, publicly labeled him "Killer Schorr," along with unprintable epithets.
Mr. Schorr leaked to the Village Voice a report on a congressional probe into the CIA in 1976. When he was identified as the leaker, CBS suspended him from reporting. Mr. Schorr later resigned.
In recent decades, Mr. Schorr became a liberal commentator for National Public Radio. He was so much older than his colleagues that some had only a hazy idea of when his career had begun. A young NPR producer once asked him if he had covered the Spanish-American War, in 1898.
Raised in the Bronx the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Mr. Schorr got started in the news business at age 12 when he sold an item to the Bronx Home News about a woman who was killed in a plunge from the apartment building where his family lived. The $5 he got for the story helped his widowed seamstress mother support the family.
After editing the newspaper at New York's City College, Mr. Schorr joined the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. He worked stateside in an Army intelligence unit during World War II, and was later sent to the Hague as a correspondent for a New York-based Netherlands news agency.
In 1953, Mr. Schorr was recruited as one of the "Murrow Boys," Edward R. Murrow's crack group of correspondents at CBS. Two years later, he traveled to Moscow to open CBS's Moscow bureau.
After being barred from the Soviet Union, Mr. Schorr became a roving international correspondent, following Mr. Khrushchev on his 1959 tour of the U.S., interviewing Fidel Castro in Havana, and then being stationed in Germany in time for the Berlin crisis of 1961. He returned to the U.S. in 1966 to "become re-Americanized," as he put it, and cover Great Society programs. He was one of the main contributors to the CBS Reports documentary "Don't Get Sick in America," an early critique of the nation's health-care system.
After helping pioneer broadcast news, Mr. Schorr moved to the nascent medium of cable, joining CNN as a commentator in 1979.
He was slower to adapt to the Internet, but in 2009, Mr. Schorr got a Twitter account. He used it to tweet that he had just given up his typewriter for a word processor.
Mr. Schorr said it made him "terribly nervous" not to work, and despite occasional criticism that he had stayed too long, he provided commentary for NPR's "All Things Considered" until a few weeks ago.

Full text: Responding to criticism of secrecy within the immigration detention system, federal officials launched an online service Friday to help relatives and attorneys find detainees in the sprawling networks of prisons and jails.
In the past, locating a relative was cumbersome, time-consuming and sometimes impossible, requiring numerous phone calls to detention centers around the nation.
The public, Internet-based tool is designed to fix that, said Phyllis Coven, acting director of detention policy and planning for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The locator can be found at www.ice.gov.
"This is about accountability and transparency," she said. "It is a project that has been needed for a long time."
Ahilan Arulanantham, who directs the immigrant rights and national security program for the ACLU of Southern California, said he was cautiously optimistic about the effort.
"We are hopeful, but our biggest concern is that the system is only good enough as the information that is put in it," he said. "We know that ICE does transfer people very quickly. It is up to them to ensure that the system continues to capture that information."
Around the nation, more than 250 jails, prisons and centers hold on average more than 30,000 immigration violators. Some are awaiting deportation while others are fighting their cases in court. Detainees are frequently transferred around the country.
Los Angeles immigration attorney Luis Ayala said the agency is "trying to alleviate the angst and anxiety" by telling families where their loved ones are being held. But Ayala said that the agency should keep individuals close to their families and lawyers.
"The fact that they are launching this is good, but the best remedy would be to not transfer them," he said.
The tool is part of a broader effort to transform the system from a prison-based model to one designed for civil detainees. "The premise is making our detention centers less penal and more tailored to the purpose of our confinement, which is the purpose of removal," Coven said.
Following media reports and congressional hearings about inadequate healthcare and deaths in detention, ICE chief John Morton last summer announced a plan to overhaul the detention system.
Since then, among other changes, the agency has stopped detaining certain asylum seekers, conducted a review of its medical program and begun a pilot intake system to better decide who should be detained and where. Coven said the agency is also working on reducing transfers and improving access to counsel.
To find a detainee, the searcher must type in the person's country of origin and either their full name or alien registration number -- a unique nine-digit number given to anyone who applies for immigration benefits or in deportation proceedings. With that information, the computer will show the detainee's location, along with contact and visiting information of the center and the local immigration enforcement office.
Coven said the agency is getting out the word about the program through community organizations, immigration field offices and the media. Brochures that explain how to use the system are available in nine languages, including Mandarin, Russian, Somali and Spanish.

Full text: Re "Planned Temecula mosque draws critics," July 18
As a Christian and an American, I am outraged by the attempt of a vocal minority to prevent Muslims from building a house of worship on land they have owned for 10 years. The critics' objections are nothing but prejudice.
The Constitution protects the right of all citizens to worship as they see fit. If we deny that right to one group, we endanger freedom of worship for everyone.
Jon Neff
Pasadena
::
The controversy here in Temecula illustrates an embarrassing lack of education in our community. Fears that a mosque would turn this conservative city into a haven for Islamic extremists are unfounded. The "confrontational atmosphere" that Pastor Bill Rench predicts would not be an issue if he practiced what he preached. Loving your neighbor is one of the greatest lessons of Christianity.
Another common concern here is the need to preserve "traditional American values." There are many military families in this town, and friends I graduated from high school with last month have signed up to serve this great country. The Times quoted a member of the local Republican women's group saying that "our boys are over there fighting and dying for our freedom."
Among our freedoms is the freedom to practice religion -- any religion. God forbid our soldiers' sacrifices have been in vain.
Samuel Leff
Temecula
::
The Times presents the views of one terribly misguided individual, Rench, who opposes building a mosque in his neighborhood. His reasoning and concerns are unfounded.
Would he oppose building a Roman Catholic Church on the grounds that it would be a draw for illegal immigrants who don't speak English? How about an AME church? Would that encourage more blacks to come to the neighborhood? A Jewish synagogue -- increased violence within the Holy Land? What about a Presbyterian church that is a member of the Covenant Network -- more homosexuals in the neighborhood threatening the children?
I wish the headline for this article had been, "Religious center embraced by Interfaith Council." A brief mention of uneducated, uninformed fringe critics would have been much more appropriate.
Leslie Evans
El Segundo
The writer is an elder of the Presbyterian Church U.S.A.
::
I have a question for Temecula residents circulating their petition against the mosque: What country do you think you are in? In the U.S., we do not get to decide who is and isn't allowed to worship in our neighborhoods.
The right -- and particularly the religious right -- is very quick to pull out the word "un-American." Well, folks, I have news for you. This is about as un-American as it gets.
Richard Murphy
Whittier
::
What does "freedom of religion" mean? Does it mean "first come first served"? Does it mean that because the Calvary Baptist Church is already established in the area, no other religions should be allowed to build or worship in their vicinity?
I am glad that was not the case when the beautiful mosque was built on Washington Boulevard in Culver City, even though I prefer attending my synagogue.
Hannah Baum Oman
Culver City
::
Last Sunday's Times published the names of 20 young Americans killed by or because of Muslims during the prior week. The same edition had a story about a proposed mosque in a Southern California community.
There seems to be some question as to why many members of that community would oppose the building of a mosque. Perhaps if we all reread the obituaries of the Americans killed by violent, dedicated Muslims overseas, we could better understand why Americans here oppose having a Muslim mosque nearby.
No more mosques in America until Muslims here condemn and oppose the use of violence in the name of their religion.

Re "Beyond the words," July 18
If technology has the power to "broaden our thinking about what a book does," I would like to add that it also has the power to "deaden our imagination."
Who, God forbid, would want to be bored by mere words when we can jump from link to link in a second, like a bee gathering drops of nectar?
As an educator, I have witnessed the waning of imagination in students during the last 10 years. If something is not visual and quick, they lose interest. Small wonder there are more students than ever with "attention deficit disorder."

Terrifying! Any readers who want can "become creative collaborators, influencing plot developments and the writer's use of dramatic devices."
Joyce and Chekhov will benefit if "young enthusiasts collaborate" on, say, "Ulysses" or "The Lady with the Dog" -- or Tolstoy can be improved by somebody helping him "weave alternative endings or side plots," say, for "War and Peace" or "The Death of Ivan Ilych"?

::
Electronic reading devices may look spectacular, but they're iconoclastic tools that only serve those who can afford them. Unlike books, they're non-transferable and cannot be passed on to others -- and they certainly cannot be handed to those who can least afford them.
The poor can eat cake, but they won't be able to access reading material in the near future.

::
For many of us old bibliophiles, the innovation of electronic books may seem an ominous threat. However, those who are not averse to change will realize that this new form of exchanging ideas will expand the depth and accessibility of written material -- the greatest means of human progress.
As with all new innovations, this trend will be resisted by many. But traditional books will become artifacts for collectors. They will be replaced by this new and more accessible innovation, which is the most expedient and ecological way to go. Although I must sadly admit that I will miss the excitement, feel and smell of a new book.

Hot under the collar
Re "AC -- it's not as cool as you think," Opinion, July 18
Stan Cox's screed against air conditioning would have been silly at any time -- let alone at the end of a week that saw temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in the Valley.
I'm starting to think that one of the things that has people so irritable in the U.S., contributing to political craziness, is that we're constantly nagged and snarled at about how everything we do is wrong -- what we eat, what we drink, what we wear, what we say, what we think, how we get around, etc.
Now we hear about one of the necessities of living in a hot climate. Scolding us that we have to increase "our physical and mental tolerance for heat" crosses the line.
And the solutions are so simple! Changing "our comfort expectations." "Restructuring cities and suburbs as pedestrian havens." "Replacing parking lots with parks."
Suuuuurre ... that's going to happen. Remake the world. Let's cram a 21st century population back to life in the 18th century.

Curing a case of road rage
Re "I was a road rage liberal," Opinion, July 17
Breaking news for Peter Mehlman: There are nuts out there, driving right alongside us regular folk. Try not to provoke them.
Mehlman's reaction to a fellow driver who needled him about his Obama bumper sticker showed a lack of imagination.
Mehlman could've said: "This is a loaner. Mine's in the shop; my real bumper says, 'My Kid Can Bench Press Obama.' "
He could have said: "I'm actually a Republican, but some bleeding heart tore the word 'impeach' off the top of my Obama sticker."
He could have thanked him for the advice, asked for a radio channel recommendation and then switched it to NPR.
He could have looked him menacingly in the eye and done a slow, deliberate nose pick.
Or -- Peter, try and grasp this concept -- he could have ignored the guy.
But follow the man? That's asking for trouble.

Full text: Daniel Schorr, who became the elder statesman of public radio after decades as a feisty television broadcaster for CBS and CNN, has died. He was 93.
Schorr died Friday morning after a short illness at a Washington hospital, National Public Radio announced. His last broadcast on that network aired on July 10.
A working journalist for more than 60 years, the indefatigable Schorr was the last active member of Murrow's Boys, the legendary group of journalists who worked at CBS News in the 1940s and '50s under Edward R. Murrow. He was a high-profile CBS reporter for 23 years before leaving amid controversy in 1976.
In 1985, after several years at CNN, he joined National Public Radio, where as a senior news analyst he was heard regularly on the "Weekend Edition" and "Week in Review" programs.
"Nobody else in broadcast journalism -- or perhaps any field -- had as much experience and wisdom" as Schorr, "Weekend Edition" host Scott Simon said Friday. "I'm just glad that, after being known for so many years as a tough and uncompromising journalist, NPR listeners also got to know the Dan Schorr that was playful, funny and kind. In a business that's known for burning out people, Dan Schorr shined for nearly a century."
Having a long view of national and world events gave the reporter who once covered Watergate and found himself on President Nixon's infamous "enemies list" a perfect second career as a sober commentator.
"He lived through so many years of history, and he put that to the service of his commentaries," Geoffrey Cowan, dean emeritus of USC's Annenberg School for Communication, said in 2004. "He never lost his edge. He was always outspoken and independent."
Schorr said he "breathed the breath of freedom" at NPR. "Nobody ever told me what not to do."
During his CBS career, he addressed serious subjects in the U.S. and on foreign assignments and won a Peabody Award for his hourlong CBS documentary on "The Poisoned Air."
But controversy followed him, because of both his aggressive coverage of stories and his sometimes cantankerous relationships with his superiors and co-workers. New York magazine in 1975 dubbed him "the great abrasive."
That year, as a CBS reporter, Schorr covered the House Intelligence Committee hearings on CIA covert operations, including assassination plots. Schorr was slipped a copy of the intelligence committee's draft report, the contents of which he reported on the CBS Sunday News. He was the only journalist to actually have a copy of the report, although the New York Times had seen it and had written about it that same day.
A few days later, partly in reaction to Schorr's reporting, the House of Representatives voted to lock up the remaining copies of the draft report and keep the final report secret.
Schorr decided that, since he had the only copy of the report in general circulation, he had a responsibility to get it published in full.
When he turned to CBS for help, however, he did not get an immediate answer, so he offered the report to the Village Voice, a left-leaning weekly newspaper in New York. The Voice published a 24-page supplement with the headline: "The Report on the CIA That President Ford Doesn't Want You To Read."
The low point during this time came when Schorr "dissembled" -- his word -- by not disabusing a CBS executive of the notion that perhaps Lesley Stahl, who worked with Schorr and who was then engaged to (and later married) Village Voice writer Aaron Latham, was involved in getting the report to the Voice.
Schorr said later that he was stalling for time in order to figure out how best to protect the person who had given him the report. But Stahl, who felt he had fingered her or Latham as a thief, was furious. Their colleagues took her side.
Though Schorr called Stahl to say he was sorry, his behavior engendered so much ill will that he was no longer welcome in the Washington bureau where both had been working.
The second and more serious consequence of getting the report published came when the House committee demanded to know Schorr's source. He refused to divulge it, risking a contempt citation.
CBS executives, upset at Schorr's giving the Voice material that they considered CBS property, asked him to resign. They agreed to a secret suspension until the committee hearings were complete and provided him with legal representation.
Months later, when Schorr was questioned by the committee, he made a strong defense of the 1st Amendment: "To betray a confidential source would mean to dry up many future sources for many reporters. The reporter and the news organization would be the immediate losers, but the ultimate losers would be the American people and their free institutions."
A week after he appeared, the House Ethics Committee abandoned its effort to have Schorr cited for contempt. And CBS News president Richard S. Salant, who was impressed with Schorr's eloquence and the positive public response to his testimony, attempted to get Schorr to stay at the network. "Difficult as Dan was from time to time, he was a great investigative reporter," Salant wrote in his 1999 memoir.
Schorr refused.
After writing "Clearing the Air" (1977), which mostly gave his side of the events of the previous two years, Schorr taught briefly at UC Berkeley and wrote a syndicated column.
In 1979, Ted Turner recruited him for his new venture in 24-hour journalism, Cable News Network.
Schorr covered the 1980 presidential campaign and the release of the American hostages from Iran, among many other major stories.
He stayed at CNN through the 1984 GOP political convention in Dallas, when he tangled with Turner over the mogul's desire to pair Schorr with former Texas Gov. John Connally as co-commentators during the convention.
Schorr balked, saying he would be happy to interview Connally "but not share the same side of the table" because he viewed Connally as a news subject.
"After Dallas, my relations with CNN management were strained," Schorr wrote in his 2001 book, "Staying Tuned." Several months later, he was put on "terminal leave" until his contract expired.
Not long after, as he neared 70, Schorr was asked by NPR, for which he had done occasional commentaries, to expand his role.
Schorr said he was "accorded some of the respect of an elder statesman" and became known for his ability to put current events -- such as President Clinton's impeachment hearings and the tumultuous 2000 presidential election -- into historical context.
He seemed to mellow somewhat. The motto with which he had started his career -- "Find out what they're hiding and tell those who need to know" -- evolved into this: "The people know a lot. Tell them what to make of it."
Daniel Louis Schorr was born to Russian immigrants on Aug. 31, 1916, in New York City and grew up in the Bronx.
His father died when he was 6 and he worked at odd jobs to help his mother, a seamstress.
"I grew up with a sense that you had to make your own way without help," he told the Washington Post's Potomac magazine in 1976.
He began on a path toward journalism as a schoolboy, editing a monthly newspaper at the Bronx Jewish Center.
At age 13, after seeing a woman jump out the window of his family's apartment building, he coolly called in the details to the local newspaper and earned his first $5 as a reporter.
He received his bachelor's degree from City College (now City University) of New York in 1939 and began his career at the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in New York.
After a stint in the Army, during which he worked in public relations and intelligence in Louisiana and Texas, he worked at a Netherlands East Indies news agency and then freelanced for newspapers and magazines.
Frustrated in his ambition to be hired by the New York Times, he turned to broadcast journalism in 1953 when Murrow, who had heard Schorr's on-the-scene radio reports of Holland's floods, invited him to join CBS News' Washington bureau.
Schorr covered Capitol Hill and the State Department before being sent in 1955 to open the network's office in Moscow.
After defying censorship regulations, however, Schorr was not allowed to return to Moscow following a visit to the U.S. in 1957.
In the ensuing years with CBS, he covered the United Nations and fielded assignments in Warsaw, Geneva, Paris, Havana and Germany.
Returning to the U.S. in the mid-1960s, Schorr covered President Johnson's "Great Society" initiatives. At age 50, he married Lisbeth Bamberger, who was working on health issues for LBJ's War on Poverty.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Jonathan, of Oakland; a daughter, Lisa Kaplan, of Boston; and a grandchild.

Full text: Bell City Manager Robert Rizzo has announced his resignation from his $787,637 a year job, as have police Chief Randy Adams ($457,000) and Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia ($376,288), and we wish all three a not-so-fond farewell. Even if they performed their work brilliantly, and even if they believed in their hearts that no one earning less could properly serve their problem-wracked city, their pay was shocking, and so utterly out of step with their counterparts in neighboring municipalities and their own struggling residents as to be inherently exploitive.
The public became aware of the disproportionate salaries earlier this month in reports by Times staff writers Jeff Gottlieb and Ruben Vives. Now Bell residents are angry and want to know why most members of their part-time City Council, which approved the contracts for the three, get an outrageous $100,000 a year when nearby council members get 10% of that, or even less. Prosecutors already are delving into that question, and they will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges.
It would be comforting to be able to conclude that the problems in Bell -- or in nearby cities such as Maywood, South Gate, Lynwood, Vernon and Compton, which have all been plagued by exploitation, mismanagement and corruption -- originated with a handful of officials who forgot their moral and fiduciary duties to the people they were supposed to serve. Or, perhaps, that the people of those cities brought these problems on themselves by electing such leaders, or by staying away from the polls and allowing themselves to be suckered.
Although there's certainly some truth to both of those explanations, the full reality is far more complex and troubling. Bell and its neighboring communities were built on factory industries and on waves of immigrants from the American Midwest who built their cities' civic institutions. They stayed, and many of their children stayed, but their grandchildren left when the factories closed. Their places are being taken by new waves of immigrants, mostly from Mexico, who are still in the process of rebuilding community and civic institutions -- but without the wealth that industry once pumped into middle-class pockets and city treasuries. Unlike the earlier waves of immigrants, many of the newest generation lack U.S. citizenship and can't vote. Those who came here illegally live and work in fear of the law and tend to keep their heads low rather than fight exploitation at the hands of those who win power.
But it's not even that simple. In 2005, soon after the governor signed a bill to cap salaries of city council members in general law cities such as Bell, public officials there called a special election to ask voters to make Bell a charter city. Only 336 voters said "yes," but it was enough. Ballot measures, drafted for purposes not immediately clear in their wording, are unfortunately not phenomena limited to small cities. That's a lesson, in this election year, for every California voter.

Abstract: Mr. Leach is wrestling with balancing risk levels at Citigroup, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by market value, and one that has managed to be a part of nearly every financial crisis in the modern era, including WorldCom, Enron and the still-smoldering mortgage crisis. For the first half of this year, the bank posted middling results in widely watched debt underwriting rankings, trailing Barclays PLC, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Deutsche Bank AG. Firms often are required to put up capital -- taking on risk -- to bring securities issues to the public.

Full text: Brian Leach, chief risk officer at Citigroup Inc., knows well the downsides of risky bets. He paid for one of his own.
As an options trader for Morgan Stanley in 1992, Mr. Leach bet wrongly that European government bonds would track British government debt. He lost a half-year's worth of his trading profit after the surprise election of British Prime Minister John Major's Conservative party.
Now, he is trying to apply at Citigroup one lesson he learned from the incident: quickly cutting losses. "It really helped define for me what downsides could look like," he says -- particularly from extreme events that disrupt historical pricing models.
Mr. Leach is wrestling with balancing risk levels at Citigroup, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by market value, and one that has managed to be a part of nearly every financial crisis in the modern era, including WorldCom, Enron and the still-smoldering mortgage crisis.
The current crisis saddled the bank with souring loans and securities. Mr. Leach is part of a team trying to sharply reduce the bank's holdings instead of trying to wait for loan values to rebound.
On July 16, Citigroup said it had sold $1.3 billion of delinquent mortgages in this year's second quarter. Mr. Leach has helped lead efforts to rid the bank of $104 billion of distressed assets and securities, including $8 billion of complex debt pools in recent quarters. There is much more to do: Citi must wind-down a $465 billion portfolio of businesses and troubled assets.
But changing a culture at a bank the size of Citigroup is no sure thing. "You've got to listen to your risk manager even when times are good," says David Hender, analyst at research firm CreditSights.
Citigroup could end up reining in risk too much and losing business as result. For the first half of this year, the bank posted middling results in widely watched debt underwriting rankings, trailing Barclays PLC, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Deutsche Bank AG. Firms often are required to put up capital -- taking on risk -- to bring securities issues to the public.
Citigroup spokesman Stephen Cohen said: "We seek to do transactions with appropriate risk measurements, managing our business for productivity and profitability and not market share."
Mr. Leach, 51 years old, was hired in February 2008 as Citigroup grappled with mounting losses tied to mortgage-debt pools that culminated in the November 2008 government bailout of the once powerful financial colossus.
He temporarily moved with his wife from his New Canaan, Conn., home to a Manhattan apartment to spend more time at Citigroup headquarters wrestling with the bank's mortgage exposure. He cleaned house, reshaping the risk group with a 13-member team of managers.
Mr. Leach is little-known outside of a tight-knit group of global risk managers, where he won respect after helping untangle hedge-fund Long-Term Capital Management in the late 1990s after it was battered by a wide range of bad derivatives and other bets that threatened Wall Street.
Raised in Weston, Mass., Mr. Leach was one of six children of a prominent orthopedist who has advised professional athletes, including the Boston Celtics. Mr. Leach learned about business from his grandfather, an English immigrant, who rose from an office boy at a mill to become a textile executive.
At Brown University, Mr. Leach excelled at wrestling in the 134-pound weight class, showing "good quickness," says his coach, Joe Wirth.
"In wrestling, there are multiple OK moves and one wrong move," Mr. Leach says. In risk management, "there are a fair amount of things that are actually OK but there is usually one thing that you can't do. And you've got to be able to understand what that is."
After working at Morgan Stanley and receiving a business degree from Harvard, Mr. Leach returned to Morgan Stanley where he advised clients on using derivatives to hedge risk such as movements in interest rates or oil prices. He later ran the firm's bond-options trading operation in London.
Mr. Leach's first financial-crisis lesson came in 1998. He was one of six bankers dispatched by Wall Street firms to Greenwich, Conn., to unwind Long-Term Capital.
Mr. Leach spent 15 months in Greenwich, along with other bankers and Long-Term traders unwinding thousands of derivatives positions without tipping off rivals to the positions. David Rogers, then a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who worked with Mr. Leach on the Long-Term Capital assignment, says: "We were constantly playing kind of a bit of a game with the Street."
Mr. Leach later left Morgan Stanley, following executives Vikram Pandit and John Havens to join their new hedge fund, Old Lane Partners LP.
In April 2007, Citigroup acquired Old Lane, setting the stage for Mr. Pandit to succeed Citigroup CEO Charles Prince in December of that year. The following February, Mr. Pandit named Mr. Leach Citigroup's chief risk officer.
Mr. Leach assigned new risk officials to Citigroup's businesses and asset classes. He and Citigroup's technology specialists designed a system to better see all exposure to assets at one time, such as real estate embedded in securities and home loans. Mr. Leach now can shock the portfolios to see how they would perform in different economic cycles, such as when home prices drop.
Mr. Leach grappled with Citigroup's ballooning exposures to its own mortgage assets as well as to other Wall Street firms. One competitor drew close scrutiny: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
In June 2008, Mr. Leach ordered that Lehman post collateral for $3 billion to $5 billion to bolster a lending agreement Citigroup had provided Lehman. Lehman officials asked for meeting with Citigroup officials, according to an internal Lehman memo later disclosed as part of a review of Lehman's eventual bankruptcy filing.
The memo indicates that a meeting was set in June 2008, just months before Lehman unraveled. "Lehman is very disappointed by Citi's knee-jerk reaction in tightening our intraday clearing lines. This reaction is contrary to Citi's Relationship Management's focus to increase operating revenues from Lehman. This decision was driven by Brian Leach."
Lehman ultimately agreed to post $2 billion to a callable account. For his part, Mr. Leach says banks needed to protect their finances while also servicing clients.
Mr. Leach increasingly worried that the banking markets could be hit by massive selling of souring assets. He flagged his concerns at a presentation in early fall 2008 in Switzerland at a meeting of central bankers, regulators and peers -- well before many others grasped the scale of the problem, says attendee Peter Fisher, fixed-income chief at money manager BlackRock Inc. and a former New York Federal Reserve official who helped oversee Wall Street's Long-Term Capital rescue.
In September, Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection. Soon after, Mr. Leach was among a half-dozen senior officials that negotiated Citi's $20 billion bailout.
He concedes that someone again will trigger a money-losing trade. Then, unwinding the unprofitable position could be the right decision.
"In this business, you won't always get it right," Mr. Leach says. "And so the question is, did you do your preparation beforehand? Did you do the work beforehand? And when those things -- all the best-laid plans go awry -- how do you respond afterwards?"

Abstract: In one, a grand jury indicted four teenagers on multiple felony charges for a brutal April 5 beating but declined to include the hate-crime charges despite a police report alleging they said, "You are a [expletive] Mexican, we are going to beat you up." Others attribute the violence to young people taking advantage of day laborers, who often carry large amounts of cash and are afraid to report crimes to the police if they are undocumented.

Full text: One sign stands out among the postings for mammograms and English classes at an immigrant center in Staten Island.
"Have you been witness to any abuse on the street?" it asks in Spanish. "Have you been the victim of any abuse?"
Since April, Latinos have been the victims of seven robberies or attacks in Port Richmond that police have classified as bias crimes. That compares with one hate crime during the same time period last year.
Arrests have been made in three of the cases. In one, a grand jury indicted four teenagers on multiple felony charges for a brutal April 5 beating but declined to include the hate-crime charges despite a police report alleging they said, "You are a [expletive] Mexican, we are going to beat you up."
The numbers reflect a spike in bias-crime figures across Staten Island -- 21 so far this year, compared with nine during the same period last year -- but authorities say that only in Port Richmond are all the victims Latino and the attacks close in vicinity to one another.
The targeting of Port Richmond is both unusual and alarming, said Inspector Michael Osgood, head of the New York Police Department's Hate Crimes Task Force. Police don't suspect the defendants are connected, but "all the defendants are operating by the same theme," Mr. Osgood said. "They're picking victims who are Mexican and they're attacking them and sometimes they're robbing them."
The attacks have left some Latinos in the area, most of them from Mexico, on edge. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Mexican Consulate have participated in community forums on the subject.
"I don't walk outside at night unless I'm with a friend," said Rogerio Vazquez, 46 years old. His arm was fractured and he suffered lacerations to his head in an April 25 attack. Police classified the attack as a hate crime and have charged a 19-year-old Asian woman and 21-year-old African-American man, who were also charged with an attack in April that was classified as a bias crime.
A grand jury didn't include the hate-crimes charges in an indictment. Both defendants have pleaded guilty to robbery charges.
Mr. Vazquez said he was hit on his arm and head with a baseball bat and fell to the ground. He was also robbed of $200 and his cellphone. A former painter, he now lives on money from El Centro del Inmigrante, a nonprofit serving the immigrant community, and donations from his friends until his arm heals and he can return to work.
Mr. Vazquez isn't alone. Alejandro Galindo, 52, goes to so many doctor's appointments because of his June 24 beating -- which is being investigated as a bias crime -- that he hasn't returned to work and continues to have blurry vision, his family says.
And Graciano Castillo, 49, says he suffered a broken jaw during a June 12 beating that he reported to police. Mr. Castillo said his attackers made anti-Mexican comments but says he didn't tell the police about them; he is from Peru.
Some attribute the hate crimes -- in which most of the suspects are African-Americans -- to economic tensions between two working-class populations.
"If you go to different businesses and look at who's doing the help in these stores, you will see they are Latino employees," said Edward Josey, president of the Staten Island NAACP. "You don't see any influx of blacks being employed in the stores. People might tend to feel that jobs they may have wanted are going to other people."
Others attribute the violence to young people taking advantage of day laborers, who often carry large amounts of cash and are afraid to report crimes to the police if they are undocumented.
"I don't see it as African-Americans are just targeting Latinos," said the Rev. Tony Baker, pastor of St. Philip's Baptist Church, a prominent African-American church in Port Richmond. "I think it's crimes of opportunity and preying on weaker people that you think may not report you or can't fight back."
Tensions over ethnicity and immigration are hardly new here. Port Richmond's downtown, once Staten Island's primary commercial district, turned into a ghost town in the 1980s. Shops boarded up, helping make way for drugs and prostitutes.
After Sept. 11, 2001, the community's once transient Mexican population began to plant roots because travel back and forth became more difficult. Now, the downtown is known as the "Little Mexico" of Staten Island. The General Store has a sign for leche and pan, milk and bread. Nate's Specialty Pharmacy notes in its window: "Hablamos Espanol." Nearby stores sell rosary beads, phone cards and Mexican candies.
Some immigrants say they feel they are targeted solely because of their race and are frequently subjected to verbal abuse, to which they have grown immune. Said Maria Morales, 48, who owns Los Potrillos Taqueria, one of the businesses targeted by a driver who drove his truck into three Mexican-owned businesses in 2008 and was charged with a bias crime, "It's not safe because I'm Mexican, I'm a target. There's not a lot of tolerance."
Ms. Morales said the number of hate crimes hasn't increased. "They just didn't report them before," she said.

Full text: The Flight of the Century
By Thomas Kessner
Oxford, 313 pages, $27.95
My father sailed to America in May 1927, and for the rest of his life he told how the Spirit of St. Louis flew low over the steamship one day while the captain sounded the latitude and longitude on the ship's whistle. True or not, the story is one that I savor as proof of the moment's significance. Merely to have been on the North Atlantic that afternoon, sharing it with Charles Lindbergh, was an honor worth telling for half a century.
Lindbergh's was indeed "The Flight of the Century," as Thomas Kessner titles his account of the transatlantic journey and its consequences for the pilot and his nation. Even as a oft-told tale (Lindbergh himself told it twice), the flight can bring tears to the eyes.
The impetus for Lindbergh and other aviators to attempt the unprecedented ocean crossing was a $25,000 prize offered by a French immigrant to the U.S., hotel owner Raymond Orteig, for the first person to fly nonstop between New York and Paris. The prize had gone unclaimed since it was established in 1919. By the mid-1920s, though, airplane technology had finally improved sufficiently to make transatlantic flight at least feasible for a pilot intrepid enough to try it.
Capturing the prize involved a race against time as well. Lindbergh's competitors, backed by substantial organizations, were readying large, multi-engine aircraft. They included polar explorer Richard Byrd, acclaimed in 1926 for being the first person to fly over the North Pole; he would be a passenger in a massive Fokker trimotor plane while professional pilots handled the controls. Lindbergh, by contrast, was a 25-year-old airmail pilot backed by hometown boosters who hoped to make St. Louis a hub for American air travel, as it had been for covered-wagon journeys the century before.
The boosters began with a pledge of $1,000 and eventually raised enough money to order a $10,580 aircraft from an obscure company in San Diego. The Spirit of St. Louis was essentially "a covered plank with fuel tanks," Mr. Kessner writes. Empty, it weighed less than a Honda Civic while carrying more than twice that weight in gasoline. The main fuel tank, in the front of the plane, was so big that Spirit had no windshield; to see what was before him, Lindbergh would use a periscope or stick his head out of a side window. To save weight, he would have no radio, fuel gauges, navigation lights or parachute; he even cut the margins off his charts.
In the weeks before the big flight, as his competitors experienced crashes and delays, Lindbergh put his new plane through its paces in California, then set out for New York. He shaved more than five hours off the coast-to-coast flying record in the process, making it from San Diego to New York, with a stop in St. Louis, in 21 hours, 20 minutes. Lindbergh's fame was growing even before he took off for Paris a little more than a week later: "No one ever more perfectly personified youthful adventure," gushed the New York Times.
Mr. Kessner does a good job of recounting the crossing, though since the only eyewitness was the pilot himself, the latter-day biographer can't bring much that's new to what was an essentially uneventful trip, aside from the feat itself. On his side, Mr. Kessner has the skills of a professional historian and a nice turn of phrase, as when he refers to Lindbergh's tube-and-fabric aircraft as "a little sprite of a plane." Unfortunately, he is apparently a bit of a tenderfoot when it comes to writing about aircraft construction and flight. He speaks of a pilot letting his airspeed drop and "freezing the engine," when what happens is that the wings stall and lose their lift. He calls the fuselage a "chassis" and the front cowling a "hood," as if Spirit were an earthbound automobile.
The author is clearly less interested in flight than in the significance of one particular flight. The bulk of the book concerns the effect of Lindbergh's achievement on the U.S. and its relations with the rest of the world. When the Spirit of St. Louis landed at Le Bourget field near Paris on the night of May 21, 1927, after 33 hours, 30 minutes, 29.8 seconds in the air, the sleepless Lindbergh was worried that the French might not let him stay overnight since he had no visa. He also had no change of clothes, no toothbrush and only 27 cents of ready money.
Lindbergh might have been even more concerned about his reception if he had known how unpopular his country was in France. At the time, nearly a decade after the end of World War I, American aid was feeding defeated Germany even as the U.S. was dunning France to repay its war debts. Much of France was even in a somber mood regarding the transatlantic-flight challenge: The country was considered the world's aviation leader, yet two of its own flyers had recently disappeared trying to reach New York.
All of that was forgotten in the delirium that greeted Lindbergh's arrival. So many cars set out for Le Bourget that the roads became extended parking lots and people ended up leaving their cars behind to continue on foot. An estimated 150,000 spectators were on hand when Lindbergh landed at 10:22 p.m.; they broke down the fences and overpowered the police and soldiers who tried to keep order.
Almost from the instant he touched down, Lindbergh was celebrated around the world, but his renown in America was unlike anything the country had ever seen. President Calvin Coolidge (who had earlier scoffed of aviation: "What was the use of getting there quicker, if you haven't got something better to say when you arrive?") sent a Navy ship to bring him home, though Lindbergh would have preferred to fly on around the globe. He was taken up by mentors including the banker Dwight Morrow, the philanthropist Harry Guggenheim and the publisher George Putnam. The Guggenheim Fund sent him and the Spirit of St. Louis on a tour of the U.S.; he visited 82 cities in 48 states and was seen by perhaps 50 million people, or 40% of the country's population. Through it all, the reserved Lindbergh was rarely seen to smile, but it didn't matter. Everyone adored him.
The adulation didn't stop at the border. When Lindbergh flew nonstop from Washington, D.C., to Mexico City in December 1927, he was greeted by a crowd of more than 200,000. (The new U.S. ambassador was the same Dwight Morrow, who in time became Lindbergh's father-in-law.) And so it went, through Latin America and the Caribbean, transforming the reputation of the U.S. in an era marked by resentment toward the big, muscle-flexing neighbor to the north. When Lindbergh stopped in Havana to address the sixth Pan-American Conference, newspapers described him as "more universally loved than any other person in the world."
Equally amazing, and perhaps more enduring, was Lindbergh's influence on the U.S. economy and especially on the aviation and airline industries. His countrywide tour persuaded thousands of communities to paint their names on factory or railway-station rooftops, essential guides to navigation in a day without radio beacons or global-positioning satellites. (When I began flight training in 1999, some of those municipal signs were still around, and even with a GPS receiver I wish they had all survived.) The future Trans World Airlines was virtually built on Lindbergh's association with the company. In large part because of Lindbergh mania, the output of aircraft manufacturers multiplied tenfold, as did their stock prices. As Mr. Kessner writes: "He became not only the voice and face but also the soul of American aviation."
The boom did not end well, as we know: The Depression took the wind out of the aviation industry until war production ramped up in 1940. Mr. Kessner goes quickly over Lindbergh's less happy years -- the kidnapping and killing of his infant child in 1932; his strong early sympathy for Hitler's Germany; his leadership of the increasingly out-of-touch America First movement on the eve of World War II. But these matters lie outside the story of a flight and its aftermath.
It is probably wise of Mr. Kessner to have kept his story so tightly focused. I wish, though, that he had not left us with a puzzle. He tells us that when Lindbergh was received by King George V in London barely a week after the landing in Paris, the British monarch asked a question about the epic flight that was on everyone's mind: "How do you pee?" We are not privileged to know Lindbergh's answer.

Full text: Daniel Schorr 1916-2010
In June of 1973, Daniel Schorr rushed onto the air for a "CBS Evening News" broadcast with a hot scoop: the contents of President Richard Nixon's "enemies list."
As he read off the list, Mr. Schorr recalled in a memoir, he was stunned when he got to No. 17: "Schorr, Daniel. Columbia Broadcasting System. A real media enemy."
The longtime newsman and commentator, who died at age 93 Friday after a brief illness, won Emmys for his Watergate coverage, scored the first U.S. TV interview with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and reported on the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall. Not long after he conducted the Khrushchev interview in 1957, Mr. Schorr was denounced in Pravda as a "provocateur" and not allowed back into the country.
In 1975, Mr. Schorr reported that the Central Intelligence Agency had conducted assassinations of foreign leaders. In a White House briefing, an infuriated former CIA director, Richard Helms, publicly labeled him "Killer Schorr," along with unprintable epithets.
Mr. Schorr leaked to the Village Voice a report on a congressional probe into the CIA in 1976. When he was identified as the leaker, CBS suspended him from reporting. Mr. Schorr later resigned.
In recent decades, Mr. Schorr became a liberal commentator for National Public Radio. He was so much older than his colleagues that some had only a hazy idea of when his career had begun. A young NPR producer once asked him if he had covered the Spanish-American War, in 1898.
Raised in the Bronx the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Mr. Schorr got started in the news business at age 12 when he sold an item to the Bronx Home News about a woman who was killed in a plunge from the apartment building where his family lived. The $5 he got for the story helped his widowed seamstress mother support the family.
After editing the newspaper at New York's City College, Mr. Schorr joined the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. He worked stateside in an Army intelligence unit during World War II, and was later sent to the Hague as a correspondent for a Netherlands news agency.
In 1953, Mr. Schorr was recruited as one of the "Murrow Boys," Edward R. Murrow's crack group of correspondents at CBS. Two years later, he traveled to Moscow to open CBS's Moscow bureau.
After being barred from the Soviet Union, Mr. Schorr became a roving international correspondent, following Mr. Khrushchev on his 1959 tour of the U.S., interviewing Fidel Castro in Havana, and then being stationed in Germany in time for the Berlin crisis of 1961. He returned to the U.S. in 1966 to "become re-Americanized," as he put it, and cover Great Society programs.
After helping pioneer broadcast news, Mr. Schorr moved to the nascent medium of cable, joining CNN as a commentator in 1979.
He was slower to adapt to the Internet, but in 2009, Mr. Schorr got a Twitter account. He used it to tweet that he had just given up his typewriter for a word processor.
Mr. Schorr said it made him "terribly nervous" not to work, and despite occasional criticism that he had stayed too long, he provided commentary for NPR's "All Things Considered" until a few weeks ago.

Full text: Too many Americans are out of work. We need to address their hardships with targeted stimulus initiatives such as extending unemployment benefits, which are a very small part of our current deficit. But we cannot continue to ignore our gargantuan longer-term structural deficits. These deficits will soar even after our economy is strong again, and they are the real threat to America's future. We must combine short-term stimulus with a meaningful plan to tackle our long-term structural deficits that would go into effect after our economy has recovered sufficiently.
People fret about the current public debt rising to 60% of GDP, which many economists believe should be the maximum debt level. But they ignore Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections that, under current policies, the public debt will reach a staggering 233% of GDP in 30 years and nearly 500% in 50 years.
This is an unthinkable and unsustainable path. In less than 50 years, for example, the CBO projects that interest payments on the national debt alone will represent nearly 20% of the entire U.S. economy and consume 100% of government revenues. This leaves not a penny for any government programs, including critically needed education, R&D and infrastructure. With plummeting savings rates, already 47% of the public debt is held by foreign nations. Borrowing trillions more from China, the Middle East and elsewhere will leave us more beholden to lenders whose interests may not align with our own. Given the growing concerns about the global debt crisis, we need to build confidence we are getting our fiscal house in order. This added confidence will help our recovery.
As the very lucky son of poor immigrants, I am also deeply concerned about preserving the social safety net for lower-income families. As we've seen in Greece, safety nets can be brutally shredded in times of fiscal crisis. If we act now, we can combine fiscal responsibility with social justice.
What specific reforms should be included in a long-term fiscal reform program? A plan will only inspire confidence and reach consensus if it confronts difficult issues that have been largely ignored. That means all options must be on the table. President Obama's bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform can play a key role in the development of such a plan.
Some have tax aversion syndrome -- they have never met a tax increase they didn't do everything in their power to block. While I believe that spending cuts must play a lead role in any solution to our long-term structural deficits, the sheer magnitude of the imbalances requires revenue increases.
Ideally, the country should raise as much government revenue as possible from a progressive consumption tax. Such a tax can be designed so that it won't overly burden lower-income families but will raise significant revenues and increase our savings rate.
However, given political realities, it is not likely that we could enact a progressive consumption tax that would raise sufficient revenues to meet our needs. Therefore, I would initiate such a tax in conjunction with a simplified income tax (that would have far fewer corporate and individual credits and deductions) -- thereby allowing for lower individual and corporate income tax rates.
Finally, we should implement a carbon tax that would reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lending, while improving the environment.
On the spending side, the country needs to address outdated and bloated programs. Why do we spend more on defense than the next 14 countries combined? We should reinstall the tight budget controls that were used successfully in the 1990s, such as caps on discretionary spending and strict pay-as-you-go rules.
Still, the brute fact is that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to account for 100% of CBO's projected long-term growth in spending (other than interest costs). With so many more elderly living much longer than ever, we have to ask: If all of us, including the relatively well off, are on the wagon, who is going to pull it? To meet these trillions of dollars of entitlement obligations, we would need to double federal taxes. Wouldn't that be generational theft?
In my view, any reforms to these vital programs should include reductions in benefits for better-off Americans, including options such as raising the payroll cap and making wage and price indexing of benefits more progressive. We should also gradually increase the retirement age for the able-bodied and index it to longevity.
The cost of health care is the most daunting and difficult challenge of our structural deficits. Medicare obligations, for example, are about five times the size of Social Security. To relieve the burden of health-care costs, we need to tackle the largely ignored systemic cost drivers, such as the fee-for-service payment system that encourages unnecessary and expensive procedures. Pilot programs made possible by the new health law can help determine reforms we should adopt and what effects they would have on costs and health outcomes.
There is no way we can simply grow out of the long-term fiscal crisis. The Government Accountability Office has projected that the economy would have to show double-digit growth in real terms for the next several decades. That's clearly impossible. We've run out of painless solutions, but to do nothing is to aid and abet a looming and most costly crisis.
Our short-term economic challenges are here and now, but our longer-term structural deficits can no longer be ignored. As an American Dreamer and a grandfather of nine, I believe that our nation can deal with both at the same time.

Full text: FLORENCE, Ariz. -- It's high noon for Arizona's new immigration law, and those on the front lines are anxiously preparing to face their new reality.
A group of deputy sheriffs gathered the other day in this dusty desert town to watch a video lesson on the intricacies of their sensitive new mission: nabbing illegal immigrants while writing tickets for routine infractions such as making a wrong turn.
Fifty miles away on the outskirts of Phoenix, Hispanic parishioners filed into St. Margaret Catholic Church to watch skits in Spanish dramatizing ways to dodge police questions about their immigration status. Among the advice they got: Give someone power of attorney lest they are suddenly separated from their children.
Amid the passions gripping the country about illegal immigration, the cram sessions are bringing what is a largely theoretical issue for many Americans to a visceral level here.
The Arizona law makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally. It requires police who stop people for routine things like running a red light to check their immigration status if there's "reasonable suspicion" they're in the U.S. unlawfully. If they can't produce proof they're here legally, the police can detain them while efforts are made to clarify their status.
The measure has been hailed in state opinion polls but denounced by the Obama administration, whose Justice Department is pressing a lawsuit that says the statute usurps federal authority over immigration. Other suits say it will result in racial profiling. Unless a federal judge now hearing some of the challenges issues a stay, the statute will take effect on Thursday.
Both sides are being urged to stay calm.
"Don't be frightened by it or run away from enforcing the law," Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu advised the deputy sheriffs assembled near his office. "Now that this is policy, we're on the hook."
"We should not panic," counselor Janette Leal told the illegal immigrants gathered at St. Margaret's. "At the same time, we can't pretend nothing is happening. We need to plan for the worst."
Some are. Thousands of illegal-immigrant families have left for other states. Boarded-up houses, shuttered stores and vacated used-car lots are ubiquitous in Hispanic enclaves. St. Margaret's has lost about 20% of its parishioners in recent months. At Park Village Apartments in Mesa, 30 of 120 units have been vacated since the law passed in late April.
Many Hispanic citizens and legal immigrants are worried, too. "This law opens the door for people like me to be harrassed," said Miguel Gomez Acosta, 32, a Lutheran pastor who has lived in the U.S. since he was eight and is a naturalized citizen. "I feel I need to carry my U.S. passport to prove my citizenship."
Anna Torres, a Mesa resident who isn't a legal immigrant, was holding a yard sale recently before packing up her family to make a fresh start in New Mexico. "I've been here 18 years and I've never seen anything like this. We're being hunted," she said.
Supporters of the law deny that. "It's not racist. It's needed," said Kelly Townsend, President of the Greater Phoenix Tea Party. "We can't afford to continue to pay for people in our state that are not citizens. That's money that should be going to balance our budget."
Mark Spencer, president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, which lobbied for the law, said about 20% of inmates in Maricopa County jails are illegal immigrants, and "they are there because of conduct, not because of skin color."
The law prohibits the use of race, color or national origin as a basis for verifying an individual's immigration status. The video shown to deputies and police says time and again not to use skin color or accent as a basis for arrest.
Some officers found that advice insulting. "It's demeaning. We all know it's wrong to use racial profiling. We learned that Day One one in the academy," said Sgt. Hunter Rankin. "Law enforcement in Arizona is being dragged into the middle of a huge political battle."
The officers are being asked to walk a fine line. "Just because someone doesn't speak English doesn't mean you're arresting them," Sheriff Babeu told his deputies. "They could have a student visa or a work permit.'"
At the same time, the law allows officers to consider, in determining whether reasonable suspicion of being in the country illegally exists, a combination of factors such as whether a person struggles with English, appears nervous or is traveling in a crowded car.
The instructional video says officers can also consider whether an individual is in an area where illegal immigrants are known to congregate looking for work or is wearing several layers of clothes when it's hot, a sign he or she may have trekked through a chilly desert night to cross the border.
"The law befuddles cadres of attorneys," said Frank Milstead, police chief of the city of Mesa. "What do you think it does to officers? It sets them up to make mistakes."
Making a mistake is also what illegal immigrants fear. On a small stage at St. Margaret's, parishioners performed skits on how to interact with police. In one version, a driver admitted to the officer who stopped her that she lacked immigration documents. The children in the back seat confirmed to the officer that their mother was from Mexico. She was detained and the kids were left wailing.
In the second version, instead of answering the officer's question about her status, the driver tried to mollify him, saying: "I'm sorry I made a wrong turn. I'll accept a ticket." This time, the children shrugged when the officer asked them where their mother was from. Ultimately, in the skit, the officer wrote a ticket and let the driver go.
The moral is, "Don't lie to the police officer. Plead with him. Negotiate with him," said Blanca Hidalgo, who had been trained to lead the session by the Valley Interfaith Project, a coalition that works with immigrants. She said, "Don't give police any reason to stop you. Fix your broken taillights and windshields."
Before the lesson began, the coach invited participants to share their concerns. "Every single day, every time I get into the car I pray to God that my family will not be separated," said Gavril Vargas, a father of four U.S.-born children who has worked 14 years at the same construction company in greater Phoenix but has no legal status.
In the front row, Ariel Dominguez, a golf-course maintenance worker who took the day off to attend the workshop, summed up the sentiment: "We're desperate."
Why stay? "We're settled here. We have good jobs," said Mr. Dominguez, whose wife works at a seafood restaurant.
Ms. Hidalgo advised participants, if detained, not to sign any forms without an attorney present. In unison, the group practiced saying, "I choose to remain silent and I want to speak to my lawyer."
Later, Ms. Hidalgo reviewed a preparation packet given to everyone. It advised undocumented families to appoint a trusted U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident to tend to their children and personal affairs in case they were detained. The packet contained a form to grant someone power of attorney over a minor. "Sign them," said the coach. "You need to be ready."
The dossier of Cristina and Jose Sanchez is already complete. It holds copies of their three U.S.-born daughters' birth certificates, Social Security numbers and immunization records; the couple's Maricopa County marriage license; their taxpayer identification numbers issued by the Internal Revenue Service and tax returns for several years.
A small envelope contains their attorney's business card. On the couple's bank statement, Mrs. Sanchez has written the PIN to access the account.
"This is the life we built here, little by little," said Mrs. Sanchez, clutching the fat green file. Two friends who are American citizens, Karina and Michael Rodriguez, will keep a copy of the documents, which name the two as parties responsible for the Sanchez children if their parents are arrested.
On the enforcement side, Mesa Police Chief Milstead said one of his biggest concerns was that an undocumented immigrant stopped for a minor infraction, in an attempt to avoid arrest, might "flee, fight" or even "kill a police officer."
He also worries that undocumented residents would refrain from reporting crimes out of fear they could be deported, compromising community safety.
Some officers on the front lines worry they could be sued over alleged profiling -- or, alternatively, for allegedly failing to enforce the law.
They were warned in the training video to prepare for the scrutiny of activists. "I urge you not . . . to be baited by the questions that may be posed to you by individuals whose purpose is to find Arizona police officers discriminatory," said Brian Livingston, executive director of the state police association.
Arizona plans to show the training video, or at least key excerpts, to all 15,000 state peace officers. One part sure to be included is advice from Lyle Mann, executive director of the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board: "Act as if every act and word is being videotaped," he said.
"The entire country is watching to see how Arizona, and particularly Arizona law enforcement, responds," Mr. Mann added. "This state and each of you have now been thrust onto the national stage, and history will be made."

Full text: Paul Rosen, an electrical engineer who in the mid-1950s helped develop the high-speed modem, spurring revolutionary progress in the nascent industry of telecommunications, died of congestive heart failure July 20 at his cottage in West Bath, Maine. He was 88.
The technology behind the modem -- a device that converts data into signals that can be passed through channels such as phone lines -- has existed in primitive forms since the late 1940s. But in those days, phone lines carried data signals inconsistently, and information was transmitted slowly.
While working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory in 1958, Mr. Rosen and a colleague, Jack Harrington, patented a device that rapidly transmitted large amounts of data over phone lines.
Their invention, "Method of Land Line Pulse Transmission," helped expand computer networks nationwide by significantly accelerating the flow of data over phone lines.
"One of my colleagues said, 'Oh, you're going to get rich on this,' " Mr. Rosen said in a 2004 interview with IEEE, the organization formerly known as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
But the patent's wording was too constrained -- the work of an inept lawyer, Mr. Rosen often said -- which allowed competitors such as AT&T's Bell Labs to create their own modems by making only minor adjustments to the patented design. Thus, Mr. Rosen never made the fortune he thought he deserved when high-speed modems based on his work began popping up across the United States.
Nonetheless, Mr. Rosen's system was a crucial addition to a landmark Army defense project during the Cold War. The SAGE program, or Semi-Automatic Ground Environment, was a series of more than 100 radar installations spread across the northern border of the United States. Each station sent data about incoming planes, such as Russian bombers loaded with nuclear weapons, to centers around the country at a rate of more than 1,800 bits per second through Mr. Rosen's modems.
The standard maximum speed for data transmission was about 600 bps, but Mr. Rosen's breakthrough technology allowed the military to monitor U.S. air space nearly in real time.
In 1979, for his leadership and contributions in military communications, Mr. Rosen was made a fellow of the IEEE, one of the most prestigious honors for engineers.
Paul Rosen was born in Boston on Jan. 4, 1922. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia, and he grew up in ghettos in suburban Boston. His father's first job in the United States was washing milk cans at a dairy.
Mr. Rosen said he became fascinated with engineering while toying with old crystal radios as a teenager. At what is now Tufts University, Mr. Rosen said, he received a "lousy education" and made money working in the school's machine shop, where he made cast-iron ingots for 40 cents an hour. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1944 and joined the Navy during World War II.
After sporadic training that included stints as an enlisted sailor and deck officer, Mr. Rosen spent the rest of his Navy service in Guam with a logistics company, supervising the loading and unloading ships.
The two supplies that Mr. Rosen said his company never ran out of were shaved ice and beer.
Mr. Rosen began working at MIT in the late 1940s, where he later received a master's degree in engineering. At the Lincoln Laboratory, he became a senior leader in the communications and mechanical engineering divisions and oversaw the development of radar systems, satellites and data encryption systems.
For much of his time at MIT, Mr. Rosen worked in Building 20, a site of antiwar protests during the 1960s because the school's ROTC and several programs funded by the Defense Department were there.
"I felt like a turkey, because here I was working my butt off and I thought doing good work, and these guys would come around and accuse me of being a warmonger," Mr. Rosen said in the 2004 interview.
He left the Lincoln Laboratory in 1977 and spent three years as head of the Defense Communications Agency. He returned to the Lincoln Laboratory in 1980 and spent four years there before retiring.
Mr. Rosen went back to school in the early 1970s for a second master's degree in psychiatric counseling from Boston University and volunteered as a crisis and intervention responder in Cambridge.
In 1992, he moved to Deerfield Beach, Fla., and taught courses on existentialism for senior citizens at Lynn University in Boca Raton.
He had lived in Silver Spring since 2006.
Survivors include his wife of 66 years, Annette Braverman Rosen of Silver Spring; three children, Mark Rosen of Auburn, Calif., Bruce Rosen of Newton, Mass., and Elliot Rosen of Takoma Park; a sister; a brother; and five grandchildren.

Full text: Daniel Schorr, 93, a combative broadcast reporter who over six decades broke major national stories while also provoking presidents, foreign leaders, the KGB, the CIA and his bosses at CBS and CNN, died July 23 at Georgetown University Hospital. The cause of death was not reported.
Mr. Schorr, a senior news analyst with National Public Radio for the past 25 years, was one of a handful of reporters with firsthand knowledge of newsmakers from the 1950s through the 2000s.
Recruited to CBS by the legendary Edward R. Murrow in 1953, he had the first televised interview with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and won three Emmy Awards for his coverage of the Watergate scandal.
The Washington Post's Bob Woodward in 1977 called Mr. Schorr "certainly one of the finest broadcast journalists, and . . . one of the toughest reporters in the business." Mr. Schorr was as fearless in exposing government misdeeds as he was in taking on his employers, including CBS board Chairman William S. Paley and CNN founder Ted Turner.
"It must mean something that, unable to accept the dictates of my bosses, I ended up in confrontations with Bill Paley after a quarter-century at CBS and with Ted Turner after six years with CNN," he wrote in his memoir, "Staying Tuned" (2001). "It may be that I am just hard to get along with, but to me it always seemed that some principle was involved."
President Richard M. Nixon ordered the FBI to investigate Mr. Schorr, but viewers liked the newsman's challenges to the powerful. Mr. Schorr's outsider status was confirmed in 1973, as he read Nixon's enemies list during a live broadcast from the Senate Watergate hearings.
Reading through the top 20 names, he came to his own name at No. 17, with a notation "a real media enemy."
"I managed not to gasp," he later wrote. "I broke into a big sweat. This was the most electrifying moment in my career."
But not the most important, in his own judgment. That came in 1975, when he had a scoop on the "CBS Evening News" that said the CIA, under several administrations, had tried to assassinate Fidel Castro and other Third World leaders. That story set off a Senate investigation that concluded the CIA had not actually killed anyone, "albeit not for want of trying," Mr. Schorr said.
While reporting on FBI and CIA scandals in 1976, he alone acquired a secret investigative report by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Leaks from the report were making headlines, but when CBS would not agree to publish the full document in print, as it had done in other instances, Mr. Schorr gave it to the Village Voice newspaper.
The national press did not hail him as a hero, which surprised Mr. Schorr. That ambivalence stemmed from reports that he accepted money for the leak and that he allowed others to falsely believe that reporter Lesley Stahl had taken the report from his desk and given it to the paper.
The House Ethics Committee, seeking his source, threatened him with contempt of Congress, and CBS suspended him. In public testimony, Mr. Schorr mounted an eloquent defense. "To betray a source would be to betray myself, my career and my life," he declared. "I cannot do it."
The House panel voted not to prosecute, but Mr. Schorr's subsequent appearance on the CBS news program "60 Minutes" didn't turn out as well. Under grilling by interviewer Mike Wallace, the depth of resentment toward Mr. Schorr at CBS became evident.
Some network executives were still fuming over Mr. Schorr's remarks to Duke University students the previous year that implied that CBS had pressured Walter Cronkite, Eric Sevareid and Dan Rather to go easy on Nixon the night he announced his resignation -- a charge all three denied.
Mr. Schorr resigned, feeling forced out of his job. His book on the incident, "Clearing the Air" (1977), didn't settle the matter. In a review of the book, Woodward criticized the "arrogant and combative" broadcaster for "self-aggrandizement" in telling his career's tales.
He had many to tell, and they brought him such fame that he ended up as a crossword puzzle clue in both the New York Times and The Post. Once a purist about keeping a distance between televised reality and entertainment, he later appeared as himself in several movies.
Scott Simon, host of NPR's Weekend Edition Saturday, who worked with Mr. Schorr as recently as his last on-air commentary July 10, considered him a father figure.
"I am just glad that, after being known for so many years as a tough and uncompromising journalist, NPR listeners also got to know the Dan Schorr that was playful, funny and kind," Simon wrote in a eulogy on the NPR Web site. "In a business that's known for burning out people, Dan Schorr shined for nearly a century."
Daniel Louis Schorr was born on Aug. 31, 1916, to poor Jewish immigrants in New York. His first news story came at age 12, when he learned that a woman had jumped or fallen from his family's apartment building in the Bronx. He called the police, then sold the news tip to a local newspaper for $5.
He graduated in 1939 from City College of New York and worked as a stringer for several New York newspapers. He served in Army intelligence during World War II, based in the United States, but at war's end lit out for Europe to become a foreign correspondent.
His dream of working for the Times was quashed when Murrow called him about joining CBS. Mr. Schorr first checked with Times managing editor Turner Catledge, who turned him away. Mr. Schorr said he learned years later that Catledge had ordered a freeze on hiring more Jewish reporters.
Mr. Schorr, among the last of the active reporters who had worked with Murrow, was often more like a print reporter than a TV personality -- he considered makeup silly, hated waiting for camera angles and did not seek to ingratiate himself with sources.
He learned to use a camera and reopened CBS's Moscow bureau, where he had the Khrushchev scoop in 1957. His defiance of censorship landed him in hot water with the KGB, and by year's end he was expelled from the country.
He became a roving diplomatic correspondent and provoked the ire of President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959 by reporting the impending resignation of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles.
President John F. Kennedy was no more congenial. He asked CBS to transfer Mr. Schorr from his West German post because Kennedy thought his reports were too pro-German. East German leader Walter Ulbricht in 1962 became so incensed during a Schorr interview that he began yelling and stalked off the set.
Amid the 1964 election, Mr. Schorr enraged Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater when he reported that Goldwater had formed an alliance with some right-wing Germans and planned to spend time at one of Adolf Hitler's retreats.
Returning to the United States, he married for the first time, at age 50, to Lisbeth Bamberger. Besides his wife, of Washington, survivors include two children, Jonathan Schorr of Oakland, Calif., and Lisa Schorr of Boston; a brother; and one granddaughter.
After leaving CBS in 1976, Mr. Schorr spent three years lecturing, writing and teaching until he was asked by Turner to join the nascent all-news cable network, CNN, as its first news anchor.
His relationship with Turner started out so well that the billionaire entrepreneur, upon learning that cable TV was unavailable in Washington in 1980, sent a satellite dish to be installed in the front yard of Mr. Schorr's Woodley Park home.
Promised editorial freedom for his commentaries, Mr. Schorr appeared less and less often on the network, particularly after he publicly objected to Turner's editorial calling for a crackdown on violent movies.
CNN did not renew his contract in 1985, and Mr. Schorr then wrote an attack on Turner's ethics for the Los Angeles Times opinion pages. Turner replied in kind. A CNN workman unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim the satellite dish.
In contrast, his 25 years at NPR went far more smoothly. As a commentator there, his deep experience covering the world gave him the gravitas to offer opinions on everything from the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the 2000 presidential race ("A judicial coup" by "the Gang of Five, philosophically led by archconservative Antonin Scalia") to placing the first decade of the 2000s in historical context.
In addition to the 1972, 1973 and 1974 Emmys, he received multiple journalism awards, including the 1996 Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Golden Baton for his lifetime work. In 2002, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Only in December did he switch from using a typewriter to a computer, he said, according to his NPR Twitter feed. And he sang at least twice on the air. During a spur-of-the-moment collaboration with musician Frank Zappa at a get-out-the-vote event in Washington, he sang two Gershwin songs, "It Ain't Necessarily So" and "Summertime."
And, in the depths of the economic downturn of 2008, he reflected on his boyhood in the Depression and sang a few bars of "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime."
"I have found a satisfying home for the evening of my career," he said in 2003. "I no longer pursue scoops, but concentrate on the context and the meaning of things. I interact with journalists a third to half my age, who seem to regard me as a walking history book.
"If asked, I tell them what lessons I have learned over the past 60-odd years. And since there are today more pressures than ever to conform, to avoid rocking the boat, I'm prone to advise: At least once in your lifetime take a risk for a principle you believe in, even if it brings you up against your bosses."

Full text: Like many teenagers, Saira Ahmad questioned her religious faith -- once she found out what it was.
Born and raised in Saudi Arabia, Ahmad always thought that she was Muslim. The Portland woman's family attended mosques and celebrated the holy days of Islam like most of the neighbors.
But after a visit to relatives in Pakistan, Ahmad discovered that her family was Ahmadi, members of an Islamic sect that is ignored or scorned by some mainstream Muslims. Her parents, fearing reprisals, had kept the details of their faith a secret.
"Why does everyone hate us?" Ahmad, now 35, remembers asking her mother. "We follow Islam. We follow the Five Pillars. We accept a messiah that the rest of the world is waiting for. I was 16, and I just didn't understand."
The Ahmadi movement was founded in 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, a native of India who said he was the messiah foretold by the prophet Muhammad. The movement's London headquarters claims more than 10 million followers across 190 countries.
Ahmadis are a small minority of the estimated 1.57 billion Muslims in the world. About 87 percent of Muslims are Sunnis, and 10 percent are Shiites, according to a 2009 study released by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.
Ahmadi Muslims have been preaching peace since the movement was founded. Now, they say they are trying to get the rest of the world to listen.
"Many, many Americans do not trust Muslims," Naseem Mahdi, the national president of the community, told thousands of listeners during the Ahmadi movement's 62nd annual convention in Chantilly last weekend.
"Love of your homeland, your place of residence, is part of your faith," Mahdi said, standing just steps away from a display that held the flags of the United States, Virginia and the Ahmadi movement.
The community's message of nonviolence seemed particularly poignant after attacks on two Ahmadi mosques in Lahore, Pakistan, on May 28 left at least 94 Ahmadis dead and more than 100 wounded.
It's a message that leaders say got lost when the community was new to the United States, because it was young and full of immigrants trying to assimilate.
''We cannot be silent anymore," said Nasim Rehmatullah, the community's national vice president.
Rehmatullah and other leaders are pushing the Muslims for Peace movement, a public awareness campaign started by the Ahmadi community. The campaign advertises Islam as a peaceful religion, condemns terrorism and advocates for the separation of religion and state and human rights.
Ahmadis differ from mainstream Muslims on the issue of prophethood. Most Muslims believe that Muhammad was God's final prophet, but Ahmadis believe that their founder was also a prophet. Otherwise, Ahmadis observe almost all Muslim practices, including reciting the Koran, praying five times a day and fasting during the month of Ramadan.
In 1974, Pakistan amended its constitution to declare that Ahmadis are not Muslims; Ahmadis are not allowed to greet each other as Muslims or refer to their houses of worship as mosques. Extremist Muslims, who see Ahmadis as heretics, have carried out a campaign against them in Pakistan ever since.
Harris Zafar, 31, who was born into the faith, heard about the Lahore attacks in an early morning phone call. "I felt a mixture of feelings -- devastation, sadness," he said. "The loss of a life is tragic. And, in a minor way, there was anger as well, that these were not random attacks, that people are teaching such hatred and misleading others in the faith."
The Ahmadi motto is "Love for all. Hatred for none." To that end, the movement's founder wrote 80 books and thousands of letters in an effort to rid Islam of what he considered fanatical beliefs.
"The ink of a scholar is holier than the blood of a martyr," Zafar said, repeating a quotation that Ahmadis attribute to Muhammad but one that other Muslims say is fabricated.

Full text: The article was largely buried in most newspapers, if run at all.
So many bodies of unauthorized migrants are being found in the Arizona desert this month, the Associated Press reported, that the Pima County Medical Examiner was stacking them like boxes of fish in a refrigerated truck.
Forty bodies were found in just the first half of the month.
Last year, 317 Americans died fighting in Afghanistan. Guess how many migrants, mostly Mexicans searching for work, died crossing illegally into America? The Border Patrol collected 422 bodies in the last fiscal year, part of a rising trend.
And most die in the desert. Here is how Luis Alberto Urrea, in his book, "The Devil's Highway," described what happens:
"Dehydration had reduced all your inner streams to sluggish mudholes. . . . Your sweat runs out. . . . Your temperature redlines -- you hit 105, 106, 108 degrees. . . . Your muscles, lacking water, feed on themselves. They break down and start to rot. . . . The system closes down in a series. Your kidney, your bladder, your heart."
Yet these deaths figure little in the debate over immigration. There is faint sense of scandal, of tragedy or, certainly, of urgency to agree on a solution. The extremists rule, with one side calling for more enforcement and the other saying enforcement doesn't work.
The former has the louder voice today, making it the bigger culprit, but the latter -- humanitarian groups, for one -- share in the blame. They seem not to find any enforcement policy they like, abandoning responsibility.
The Obama administration, like the Bush administration before it, is caught in the middle, a Gulliver tied by Lilliputians and unable to take command of the fight.
If our nation's legislators felt free to vote their conscience and intelligence, it's a good bet that at least 80 percent of the Senate and two-thirds of the House would vote now for a comprehensive immigration package. It would include a robust temporary worker program, improved workplace enforcement, recruitment of highly skilled immigrants and a pathway to legalization for the estimated 10.8 million unauthorized immigrants here.
There would be wrangling over the details, but the agreement on these principles is no secret among Washington insiders in the debate. The rest of the country just doesn't know it.
In polling, most Americans say much the same about those principles, but our solons, unable to see beyond the November elections, timidly cow to the extremists in their political bases.
What might help some of them find their spine? The president must first find his.
A good place to begin is on the U.S.-Mexico border. The first of the 1,200 National Guard troops President Obama has ordered to the border arrive Aug. 1. The president should make a dramatic gesture and send as many as 10,000 more. Instead of the 500 going to Arizona, he should up the force there to at least the 3,000 that Republican Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl are asking for.
The gesture is mostly political -- the Guard is not trained for border patrolling -- but political action is what's needed now. This would reassure the American middle that the government is in control and give legislators the cover they need.
Besides, the temporary show of force may deter more immigrants from crossing the desert and dying.
The second thing the president should do is reach a quick deal with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on a temporary worker program. The chamber went off the deep end with its recent diatribe that the administration is anti-business, but the business side of the Republican Party must be re-empowered against the immigration restrictionists of the Tea Party movement, on this issue and much more.
Employers want such a program, and no amount of enforcement will work without legal avenues to help them fill jobs that Americans can't or won't do at competitive wage levels.
The alternative is to do nothing and have more scenes such as that of 29-year-old Jorge Garcia. On his way last year to rejoin his family, Garcia, a diabetic, was found in the Japul Mountains on the border with California, dead from what coroners later said was a lack of insulin. Clutched in his fingers was a photo of his daughters.

Full text: Federal investigators have identified about 20 Pentagon employees and contractors who allegedly bought and downloaded online child pornography and in some cases used their government-issued computers to view the illegal material.
On Friday, the Defense Department's inspector general's office released a 94-page report that says some of those involved possessed top-secret security clearances and worked for such divisions as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the National Security Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office. Those agencies deal with some of the government's most sensitive intelligence and defense work.
The government auditors released the report -- with some names and other information redacted -- after the pornography investigation was first reported by the Boston Globe.
The exact number of Pentagon employees investigated was not disclosed in the report, but a Pentagon spokeswoman said the probe involved about 20 people who had an "affiliation with the Defense Department" as full-time employees, former military members or contractors.
Some of those people have been prosecuted, and some of their cases were dropped for lack of evidence. Other cases remain open. Gary Comerford, a spokesman for the inspector general, said the agency takes such cases very seriously. He would not comment on individual cases, saying the report "speaks for itself."
The cases are part of a wider probe, Operation Flicker, which was started by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement four years ago and which has identified more than 5,000 people who subscribed to child pornography Web sites.
The cases detailed in the new report include one involving an employee of Oracle Corp. who had a top-secret clearance and worked on a contract for the National Security Agency. The man subscribed to various child pornography Web sites and made 21 purchases. After authorities started investigating him, the report said, he attempted to tamper with computers at his office. He was put on administrative leave with pay. He later fled to Libya but was arrested and extradited to the United States.
Another case involved a government employee at the National Defense University in Norfolk who made two purchases from a child pornography Web site. He pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and was sentenced to five years in prison.
It is an illegal use of government property to access pornography with a government computer, officials say.

Full text: Just as racial issues have returned to the forefront of political debate, Virginia Sen. James Webb (D) on Friday reiterated his opposition to some affirmative action programs and suggested that white Americans are being "marginalized" by current government policies.
In a Wall Street Journal op-ed headlined "Diversity and the Myth of White Privilege," Webb writes: "Forty years ago, as the United States experienced the civil rights movement, the supposed monolith of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant dominance served as the whipping post for almost every debate about power and status in America. After a full generation of such debate, WASP elites have fallen by the wayside and a plethora of government-enforced diversity policies have marginalized many white workers."
This is not a new topic for Webb, whose complicated views on race-based programs were an issue in his 2006 Senate campaign, when some of his fellow Democrats complained that Webb sounded like a Republican. In a 2000 book review, also published in the Wall Street Journal, Webb wrote that affirmative action "has within one generation brought about a permeating state-sponsored racism that is as odious as the Jim Crow laws it sought to countermand."
Webb has said he supports some preferential programs for African Americans but not for other ethnic and immigrant groups. He reiterated that point in Friday's op-ed.
"I have dedicated my political career to bringing fairness to America's economic system and to our work force, regardless of what people look like or where they may worship," Webb writes. "Unfortunately, present-day diversity programs work against that notion, having expanded so far beyond their original purpose that they now favor anyone who does not happen to be white."
Webb's latest airing of his views comes during a week when racial issues have dominated the headlines, after the firing of Agriculture Department official Shirley Sherrod sparked debates on alleged "reverse racism" and whether the Obama administration -- and society as a whole -- is capable of engaging in mature discussions of racial issues without descending into acrimony.
Asked whether Webb's latest piece was prompted by the racial controversies of recent days, Webb spokesman Will Jenkins said Webb would let the article speak for itself.
Though Webb's position on affirmative action has long been known, at least one prominent Virginia Democrat -- former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder -- was highly critical of Friday's column.
"If it's not for the civil rights movement and diversity programs, he would not be a United States senator today," Wilder told the Associated Press, referring to Webb's 2006 victory with the help of minority voters. "Things are tough enough without having people you thought were friends do things like this."
In recent weeks, some conservatives have cited the controversy over the New Black Panther party and comments by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to promote the idea that the current White House is biased against whites.
Webb makes no such allegation in his op-ed, although he does complain that immigrants who have come to America in recent decades "have frequently been the beneficiaries of special government programs. The same cannot be said of many hard-working white Americans, including those whose roots in America go back more than 200 years."

Full text: As the only organization providing free legal assistance to detained immigrants in Virginia, we feel that the July 18 Metro article on the new immigration detention center in Farmville, Va., overlooked several important facts.
First, the Farmville facility represents the Obama administration's effort to create a "civil detention" system in which low-level immigration violators are housed in a less restrictive environment. While we applaud the administration's efforts to create a more humane detention system, we are concerned that the increase in minimum-security detention is inconsistent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's stated policy objective of prioritizing the detention and removal of dangerous criminal noncitizens.
Further, immigration judges are already struggling to keep up with their caseloads; expanding the Department of Homeland Security's capacity to detain individuals without providing corresponding resources to the courts will worsen this problem.
Less than 30 percent of people deported last year had criminal records. As Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to expand its enforcement capacity, arrests of noncriminal immigrants continue to outpace any other enforcement effort. The Farmville facility represents an expansion of enforcement against hardworking families, not dangerous criminals. We need smart, comprehensive immigration reform that serves our nation's economic and humanitarian interests -- not a blunt expansion of a failed policy that tears families apart and harms our economy.

Full text: Jailed immigrants get help
U.S. Web site will track location of detainees
Responding to criticism of secrecy within the immigration detention system, federal officials launched an online service Friday to help relatives and attorneys find detainees in the sprawling networks of prisons and jails.
Locating a relative has been cumbersome, time-consuming and sometimes impossible, requiring numerous phone calls to detention centers around the nation.
The public, Internet-based tool is designed to fix that, said Phyllis Coven, acting director of detention policy and planning for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The locator can be found at www.ice.gov.
"This is about accountability and transparency," she said. "It is a project that has been needed for a long time."
Ahilan Arulanantham, who directs the immigrants' rights and national security program for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, said he was cautiously optimistic about the effort.
"We are hopeful, but our biggest concern is that the system is only good enough as the information that is put in it," he said. "We know that ICE does transfer people very quickly. It is up to them to ensure that the system continues to capture that information."
Around the nation, more than 250 jails, prisons and centers hold on average more than 30,000 immigration violators. Some are awaiting deportation while others are fighting their cases in court. Detainees are frequently transferred around the country.
Los Angeles immigration attorney Luis Ayala said the agency is "trying to alleviate the angst and anxiety" by telling families where their loved ones are being held.
But Ayala said that the agency should keep individuals close to their families.
"The fact that they are launching this is good, but the best remedy would be to not transfer them," he said.
The tool is part of a broader effort to transform the system from a prison-based model to one designed for civil detainees.
"The premise is making our detention centers less penal and more tailored to the purpose of our confinement, which is the purpose of removal," Coven said.
Following media reports and congressional hearings about inadequate health care and deaths in detention, ICE chief John Morton announced last summer a plan to overhaul the detention system.
Since then, among other reforms, the agency has stopped detaining certain asylum seekers, conducted a review of its medical program and begun a pilot intake system to better decide who should be detained and where.
Coven said the agency is also working on reducing transfers and improving access to counsel.

Soldiers survive roadside bomb in Afghanistan
Capt. Melvin Cabebe of the 101st Airborne Division stands near a burning armored vehicle after it struck an improvised explosive device Friday in the Arghandab Valley north of Kandahar, Afghanistan. The four passengers in the vehicle, built to resist roadside bombs, escaped with minor injuries. But a soldier in the same area was badly wounded when he stepped on a mine.

'Mafia cops' conviction upheld by appeals court
NEW YORK -- The conviction of two police detectives dubbed the "mafia cops" for their role as mob hit men was upheld Friday by a federal appeals court.
The former New York Police Department detectives were convicted by a federal jury on conspiracy charges including racketeering, kidnapping and murder. The two are serving life sentences.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York threw out appeals by Stephen Caracappa and Louis Eppolito seeking to overturn their convictions, finding they were "without merit."
Fla. woman guilty of murder in love triangle
CLEARWATER, Florida -- A 20-year-old Florida woman involved in a love triangle was found guilty Friday of second-degree murder for fatally stabbing her romantic rival in a fight 15 months ago.
Rachel Wade convulsed in sobs as the bailiff read the six-person jury's verdict, which carries a sentence of 20 1/2 years to life in prison.
Wade testified Thursday that she stabbed 18-year-old student Sarah Ludemann only after she herself was hit three times in the head during the fight. Ludemann, who was unarmed, died at the scene after being stabbed twice in the chest. The jury didn't buy Wade's claim that she acted in self-defense -- returning its verdict after just 2 1/2 hours.
"There's no doubt that both of these families will be devastated for the rest of their lives," defense lawyer Jay Hebert said.

U.S. knocks Venezuelaon tiff with Colombia
CARACAS, Venezuela -- The United States on Friday criticized Venezuela's breaking of ties with U.S. ally Colombia as "petulant" and urged President Hugo Chavez to address charges by Bogota of Colombian rebels hiding in Venezuela.
The State Department made the comments after Venezuela's army warned Colombia that it was ready to repel any attacks a day after Chavez severed relations in protest at Colombian allegations of the guerrilla presence in his nation.
State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said it was unfortunate that Venezuela, still a leading U.S. oil supplier despite Chavez's anti-U.S. stance, would not allow an international commission to verify the Colombian charges, as requested by Bogota at the Organization of American States.
Venezuelan leaders heaped invective on outgoing Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, calling him a "warmonger." But they said the border with Colombia remained calm Friday.
Transfer of Marines from Okinawa delayed
TOKYO -- Washington has given up on moving 8,000 U.S. Marines to the U.S. territory of Guam from Japan by 2014, media said Friday, a potential blow to Prime Minister Naoto Kan who is already struggling over a U.S. base dispute.
The planned transfer of Marines from the island of Okinawa is part of a larger agreement between Washington and Tokyo that includes relocating functions of the U.S. Futenma air base in Okinawa to a less crowded area on the island.
Washington's likely delay in transferring the Marines could push back the relocation of Futenma as well, Yomiuri newspaper reported. It said the likely delay was disclosed in a briefing given by the U.S. Navy to Guam's government.
Attack kills 16 alleged militants in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD -- A suspected U.S. drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region killed 16 alleged militants Saturday morning, Pakistani officials said.
Local government official Ghafoor Shah said the drone fired at least five missiles at a suspected militant compound in South Waziristan, a district in Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border.
Pakistani military officials say South Waziristan was the nerve center of the Pakistani Taliban until a major army offensive last year chased most of the Taliban fighters away.
THE NEWSMAKER
An animal rights activist was ordered held without bond after federal prosecutors charged him Friday with an arson fire that destroyed a suburban Denver sheepskin business.
Walter Edmund Bond, 34, was arrested after an informant told authorities that he boasted on an Animal Liberation Front Web site that he "torched" the business, according to an affidavit. The blaze destroyed the Sheepskin Factory, causing $500,000 damage. According to the informant, Bond went by the moniker "Lone Wolf."

Full text: Labor in jail
Thank you to Tribune reporter Colleen Mastony for "Childbirth in chains; More than 20 former Cook County inmates have filed suit, say they were handcuffed or shackled during labor; 'I was treated like I wasn't human'" (Page 1, July 18). I would like to add some additional points:
* Misogyny is a hate crime.
* If the state of Illinois has a law banning the practice of restraining detainees in labor, then the involved Cook County correctional officers should be charged with committing the crime.
* A pre-trial detainee remains innocent of a crime until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
* Handcuffing and shackling a woman who has been charged with, but not convicted of, a non-violent crime may be excessive force.
* I believe a civil suit is not about justice. A civil suit is about money.
-- Barbara A. Fletcher, Kenilworth
Horrifying abuse
News is news and generally I can read a story and deal with it.
Your story on "Childbirth in chains," however, literally gave me goose bumps up and down my arms.
It sickens me that we have human beings in this world who still abuse others in this manner and that they have the audacity to play dumb and defend their behavior.
"Horrifying" is an understatement!
Outside the boundaries of criminal court, abusers are subject to punishment by our criminal law system.
However, if you work for the criminal law system, you have the authority to abuse and suffer no consequences?
I am a paralegal student in my second year.
I have been exposed to some pretty amazing stories over the past year that I would have never known about had I not been privy to some unique law resources.
It sickens me how a system that has been implemented to protect our constitutional rights actually plays a reverse role and deliberately violates them and then denies it.
Lies, lies, lies; it is so infuriating!
The mere fact that these officers claim they do not know when labor begins is just an enormous bunch of infuriating nonsense.
Most of these women were non-violent offenders and to be honest, even violent offenders are protected by the Constitution against torture.
Here we are sending our American troops over into foreign countries to protect them from nonsensical governments that torture and abuse their people and yet our own judicial system tortures our own people at will.
This was a very informative article; thank you for doing the research and sharing your findings.
-- Sharon Bonfitto, Orland Park
Insensitive officers
Correctional officers do not know what labor is?
Isn't that why they are taking the woman to the hospital?
Beyond ridiculous!
And since when does a corrections officer determine how a patient is to be treated and not the doctor?
These women should be able to have epidurals.
I'm appalled that this can happen in a hospital in the United States. Have those officers ever wondered how they would feel if the woman was someone they cared about? Or are they so insensitive that it would not matter?
-- T. Lili Grazulis, Grayslake
Angry society
I am disgusted by the vicious online comments on your expose of incarcerated mothers being cruelly chained and shackled while in labor. There is something shocking about the hateful diatribes heaped upon these moms.
The practice is illegal, so end of discussion. These are young, poor women, charged with minor crimes. In our country their sentences don't include pain and torture.
Americans take pity on a Wall Street billionaire who steals hundreds of thousands of dollars, and then want to stomp on these young women.
Let's focus on the innocent babies who deserve a dignified start in life. All religions would look upon this shackling of mothers in labor as a godless act.
Where are the tender mercies? Where is the "judge not, lest ye be judged" open heart? The deluge of mean comments speaks volumes about this angry society we have become.
-- Carol Becker Olson, Racine, Wis.
Impossible job
Here is the job description for mayor of Chicago: Keep unions happy. Keep all racial and ethnic groups happy. Keep aldermen happy. Keep visitors and trade shows coming. Keep buses running. Keep streets shoveled. Keep taxes low. Keep gang activity low. Keep a Chicago focus in county and state government, etc.
If all those who are unhappy with the mayor know of candidates who can do all of the above and more, submit their names.
-- Jeanne Sokolec, Chicago
A broken immigration system
As university faculty we're not supposed to have favorites in our classrooms. But we must admit that we do work with some "DREAM" students.
These students study hard. They come to class prepared. They ask smart questions. They're not afraid to speak their minds. They demonstrate maturity beyond their 18, 19 or 20-something years. Many of them are bilingual, or even trilingual. And they have big dreams for their futures.
But they're undocumented.
Their hard-earned diplomas will be relegated to mere decorations, framed and hung proudly above their parents' living-room couches in immigrant enclaves across metro Chicago. These bright, talented students will have few professional options when they graduate. Their stars shine brightly in our classrooms, but they will be forced back to the shadows after they graduate, accepting low-paying jobs as they fear deportation.
These students -- immigrant youth who came to this country with their parents when they were very young children -- are victims of a broken immigration system. They are undocumented but eager to contribute to the only country they've ever called home.
A way forward for these bright students exists with the DREAM Act, a piece of legislation that offers a pathway to education, careers and documentation. The DREAM (Development, Relief and Education of Alien Minors Act) Act will allow them to step out of the shadows and to continue their education, which benefits them, their families and the U.S. economy. It's a win-win for us all, but it can only move forward with broad public support.
Enabling these students to realize their full potential through DREAM provides a solid step forward as a down payment on immigration reform. As their teachers it is our job to foster their dream -- and that's why we fully support the DREAM Act, legislation that will allow them to do just that.

Full text: The incident occurred more than a year and a half ago at a polling place on Fairmont Street in Philadelphia.
"Minister King" Samir Shabazz, a leader in the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, was out front in a military-style uniform and wielding a night stick. Jerry Jackson, who lived in the apartment building where voting was under way and was a city-certified poll watcher, also was in uniform and had joined Shabazz at the door. Together the two black men were "making intimidating statements and gestures to various individuals," according to the Justice Department.
But were they violating anyone's right to vote in the presidential election that November 2008?
The Justice Department, in the waning days of the Bush administration, filed a civil suit against the two men and the party, seeking injunctions prohibiting any such behavior in future elections. But the Obama Justice Department dropped proceedings against Jackson and the party after obtaining an injunction against Shabazz.
Conservatives maintain the case demonstrates that the Obama administration is only interested in prosecuting whites for racial activity. Indeed, one prosecutor in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division resigned over what he calls President Barack Obama's "lawless hostility toward equal enforcement of the law.'
But J. Gerald Hebert, a former senior voting rights prosecutor and supervisor at the Justice Department, noted that the polling place was in a black neighborhood.
"You have to prove some kind of injury to somebody," Hebert said in an interview. "And they didn't station people at every polling booth in Philadelphia. They didn't block people from voting."
Nevertheless, the issue has become a flash point for conservatives and is the subject of two investigations -- one by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility and the other by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. When viewed alongside the experience of Shirley Sherrod, the former Agriculture Department worker in Georgia fleetingly, though untruthfully, accused of reverse discrimination last week, it constitutes a shifting of traditional notions of victimhood and has inflamed perceptions among some whites that a black president is out to get them.
The most recent parallel to the Philadelphia case was in 2006 when three white, anti-immigrant activists with the Minutemen showed up at a polling spot in Tucson, Ariz. One was armed with a 9 mm gun on his side. He also carried a camera and clipboard -- all allegedly to scare off Hispanic voters.
But the Justice Department declined to take action because, as in Philadelphia, no one was prevented from voting.
As Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, who heads up the Civil Rights Division, testified in December before a House Judiciary subcommittee: "The maximum penalty available under the relevant provision of the Voting Rights Act is injunctive relief, and that was the penalty that was obtained."
Abigail Thernstrom, vice chairwoman of the Civil Rights panel, wrote in a National Review online article this month that the New Black Panther Party is "a lunatic fringe group that is clearly into racial theater of minor importance.
"Forget about the New Black Panthers Party case," she urged her fellow conservatives. "It is very small potatoes."
(The smaller, new organization is not affiliated with the militant Black Panther Party of the 1960s and early 1970s.)
Other conservatives, however, are not letting go, and the matter continues to be flogged by Fox News, which repeatedly has aired video of a separate New Black Panther Party incident where a member in uniform urges the death of white babies he calls "crackers."
Leading the effort on Capitol Hill is Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. "Refusal to address these concerns only confirms politicization of the issue," he wrote to Justice officials last July.
This month J. Christian Adams, the prosecutor who resigned when the charges were dropped, told the Civil Rights panel that he disagreed the incident was just "very small potatoes."
A voting rights intimidation case can have just one defendant, Adams said. "It doesn't matter. If you break the law, you break the law."
Rare prosecutions
In the last three decades, the federal government has filed only three similar cases where voter intimidation based on racial hatred was alleged. Indeed, in the 45 years since Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, fewer than 10 similar cases have even been brought to their attention.

Full text: Icons Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot famously posed in fuller-cut swimwear and came off sexier than any bikini-clad Sports Illustrated cover girl could. If you want to channel that retro style at the beach, try posing this summer in something from Marysia Swim.
Marysia is only three seasons old, but the line's classic looks are a fresh breeze in a sea of body-baring bikinis. Designer Maria Dobrzanska Reeves draws inspiration from swimsuits from the 1940s through 1970s and from her childhood ballerina training in Warsaw -- hence the tutus and leotard shapes.
Oddly, Reeves is not based in the swimwear hubs of Orange County, Calif., or Miami but in a town not renowned for bikinis -- Charleston, S.C. Reeves received her design training at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles and the swim collection is manufactured in LA.
"People with great bodies can wear the swimwear, and so can normal women who have kids," explains Reeves, 29, mother of a 3-year-old daughter. "Marysia" is Reeves' family nickname in Polish. After ballet school, she immigrated to the U.S. from Poland as a teenager to join her parents in Delaware.
Among Marysia's selection of mix-and-match bikini styles are the Ballerina high-waist ruffled bikini bottoms ($98) and Tutu halter ($102) in vintage shades such as "buff champagne." The Releve ($149) is a one-piece suit in reversible fabric, featuring a plunging neckline that evokes the French Riviera jet-set style of the 1960s and 1970s.
For apres soleil, Marysia offers a collection of coverups like the Jete ($238), a one-shoulder short mesh dress that can be worn on or off the beach.
For summer 2011, Reeves is updating her high-waist bottom with side buttons to unbutton and fold-over when sunbathing.
In the fall, Marysia will add a girls swimwear collection called Bumby -- after Ernest Hemingway's nickname for his first son -- for ages 2 to 8. Reeves launched Bumby because she was frustrated trying to find swimwear that wasn't a "miniature version of an adult suit" for her daughter.
"I didn't want my daughter to wear a string bikini," says Reeves, whose husband, Nathaniel, is in charge of sales for Marysia. "I also wanted mother-daughter swim pieces that were similar but not matchy matchy."

Full text: On first reading, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling issued earlier this month seemed absurd: Immigration judges should reconsider whether women from Guatemala constituted a "particular social group" whose members could face persecution simply for being female, in which case they would be eligible for political asylum in the United States.
Wait just a minute, we thought. Sure, Guatemala is a horribly violent country, and sure, we believe in providing sanctuary to the truly persecuted whose governments do not protect them. But could all female Guatemalans really be eligible for asylum, as this would suggest? What about Guatemalan men, who are killed at six times the rate of women? Are Guatemalan women really more persecuted than the women of Juarez, Mexico, where about 400 have been killed over 15 years, or those of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where rape routinely has been used as a weapon of war? And how could the United States be expected to absorb millions of women -- half the nation of Guatemala -- and, by extension, other vulnerable women from around the globe?
As with so many things, however, this ruling was not quite what it seemed to be. On closer examination, it turned out to be less revolutionary and less sweeping. Though it is unusually and perhaps impractically broad, this was not the first time a court considered gender-based asylum claims; judges already had granted this status to women in Africa who fear genital mutilation and those in China who face forced abortions, and even to Guatemalan women who have suffered spousal abuse. More important, even if Guatemalan women were to be deemed a particular social group by the courts, their petitions still would have to be decided on a case-by-case basis. People are not granted asylum just because they belong to a group; they must prove a personal, well-founded fear of persecution and lack of government protection. In short, it was unlikely to open the door to a tsunami of new Guatemalan immigrants.
In 2009, the U.S. granted asylum to 22,119 people. About 25% came from China, followed by Ethiopia and Haiti with 5% and 4.5%, respectively, and Guatemala in eighth place with 2.3%, or 513 people. The government tracks applications and adjudication by country, not by reason, and therefore does not have the information necessary to evaluate whether previous designations of a social group have led to significant increases in asylum applications, officials say. Some asylum advocates and former immigration judges say that based on anecdotal evidence -- and the experiences of other countries -- they don't think it has.
In most cases, a person seeking asylum in the United States must be in the country already or at a U.S. port of entry to make the request. The president reserves the right to make exceptions, as in the case of Cuba or Iraq. Under international conventions and U.S. law, an asylum applicant must have a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. While the first four groups are relatively easy to identify, courts have struggled to define what constitutes a particular social group. Asylum attorneys have sought to include various threatened groups that don't neatly fit into the other categories -- homosexuals, Romas (or Gypsies, as the courts have called them) and women who may be subjected to violence directed at them solely because of their gender, such as genital cutting. Membership in such a group, assuming the courts accept it, is necessary but not sufficient grounds for gaining asylum.
In this case, Lesly Yajayra Perdomo, who came to the United States illegally at the age of 15 to join her mother and was issued a deportation notice 12 years later, argued that she faced persecution if returned to Guatemala, where women are killed at a high rate with impunity. An immigration judge declined to find that she belonged to a particular social group, and the Board of Immigration Appeals rejected her claim that "all women in Guatemala" should be considered a protected social group. The federal appeals court, however, said that was inconsistent with previous opinions by both the immigration board itself and the appeals court, and sent the case back to the lower court to review whether Guatemalan women could indeed be considered "a cognizable social group" and, if so, whether Perdomo could demonstrate fear of persecution "on account of" her membership.
We certainly don't want to minimize the threats to women in Guatemala, or around the world, for that matter. Generally speaking, women don't have the political and economic clout or the firepower that men have, and there are plenty of situations in which women are subjected to crimes simply because they are women: spousal abuse, forced marriage, forced sterilizations, sex trafficking and honor killings, to name a few. The problem in this case is that Guatemala is dangerous not just for women but for everyone. The homicide rate for women is somewhat higher in Guatemala than in the rest of Latin America, and that is disturbing. But the homicide rate there last year (which was more than three times Mexico's) was much worse for men than women: 709 women were killed compared with 6,498 men. And though many of the slain men quite likely were involved in gang violence and criminal activities, impunity is rampant across the board -- about 98% for the killing of women, according to the U.S.-based Guatemala Human Rights Commission, and just slightly less than that for men.
Too many cultures see violence against women as a prerogative, not a crime. The United States must continue to fight against this and offer protection to the most endangered people, but it cannot be expected to provide refuge to all women at risk. Though it is important to broaden the umbrella to include groups of persecuted people who don't fall into the prescribed categories, the designation of all Guatemalan women is simply too broad. On points like this, either the U.S. attorney general or the U.S. Congress could help by clarifying what constitutes a protected social group. The solution to the problem of violence against women, however, is not just to accept victims into the United States but to forcefully address the cultural biases and lack of justice in the countries where it is taking place.
One way to do this would be for Congress to pass the bipartisan International Violence Against Women Act, which seeks to make the issue a priority for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. This would direct U.S. support and assistance to educational, economic and other programs that address the root causes of violence against women, and build up the rule of law to hold abusers accountable.

Full text: Irvin R. Lai, a revered Chinese American community leader in Los Angeles best known for his efforts to save the roast duck in Chinatown and to ensure the proper handling of burial remains exposed during the Metro Gold Line extension, has died. He was 83.
Lai was surrounded by his family when he died July 16 at Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Medical Center from complications of pneumonia, said his daughter Kathleen Lih.
Born in 1927 on a farm outside Locke, the historic Chinese settlement in the Sacramento River delta, Lai was a third-generation Chinese American who moved to Los Angeles in his teens, served in the U.S. military during World War II and the Korean War, went to college on the GI Bill and eventually worked in the family's restaurant, refrigeration and construction businesses.
But his heart and all his spare time were devoted to serving the community, a virtue he acquired from his mother, Effie Lai, a volunteer social worker who helped new immigrants from China adapt to life on California's old frontier.
"He was probably one of the greatest Southern California civil rights leaders I've ever known," said Assemblyman Mike Eng (D-Monterey Park). "He was at the forefront of virtually every civil rights issue in Southern California."
As an active promoter of Chinese culture, history and civil rights, Lai took on numerous leadership positions, including national president of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, head of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles, commissioner of the Asian American Education Commission and director of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Assn.
One of his most prominent battles was seeking justice in the 1982 beating death of Vincent Chin in Detroit, a cause that became a watershed moment for the national Asian American community. Chin was a Chinese American killed by two white men who had mistaken him as being Japanese. The first trial resulted in a light sentence for the assailants that outraged the community. Lai and other Asian American leaders went to Washington, D.C., to demand a retrial.
During his decades with the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California, where he wore many hats including chairman of the board, Lai helped preserve and restore the oldest structure built by the Chinese in Los Angeles, an 1888 burial shrine at Evergreen Cemetery.
As he approached his 80s, he continued to speak out for those who could not, especially the bones discovered in a long-lost potters field outside Evergreen Cemetery. Believed to belong to Chinese railroad workers who helped pioneer the American West in the early part of the last century, these gravesites were disturbed during the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 2005 Gold Line extension in Boyle Heights.
"Irvin was always passionate, unafraid to ruffle feathers, to take on the most powerful people and big agencies like the MTA," said Eugene Moy, past president and current board member of the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California. "After more than two years of attending meetings with officials, a memorial wall has been erected and paid for by the MTA. We might not have gotten this far without a strong advocate like Irvin."
One of Lai's proudest accomplishments was the Chinese roast duck bill of 1982. Chinese restaurateurs were forced to toss their roast Peking ducks because the preparation involves hanging and drying the meat at room temperature for several hours, a tradition that violated health codes.
When officials threatened to remove the Chinese delicacy from L.A.'s Chinese restaurants, Lai spearheaded the effort to prove them wrong. His impassioned testimony before the state Legislature helped win the health code exemption that ensured the longevity of the popular dish in America.
Lai is survived by a son, Lawrence; five daughters, Arlene Lowe, Corinne Gill, Irene Jong, Kathleen Lih and Pauline Yau; a brother, Collin; a sister, Mildred Wong; 12 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. His wife, Jessie, died in 1984.
A viewing will be held at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, 1712 S. Glendale Ave., Glendale.
The funeral will be at 11 a.m. Thursday at Alhambra True Light Presbyterian Church, 20 W. Commonwealth Ave., Alhambra.

Full text: Re "3 Bell officials asked to resign," July 21, and "Bell scandal may spur a civic shift," July 22
If we voters fail to be vigilant, our communities will continue to be vulnerable to the abuse of corrupt and misguided managers and elected officials. While working-class voters don't have much time to spare between earning a living and raising their families, finding the time to participate in city government is integral to a well-run city that serves the needs of its residents rather than the whims of self-serving council members and managers.
Get informed by attending regular city council meetings, educate your neighbors and hold your elected representatives accountable with your vote at the ballot box.

We want to commend The Times for its articles regarding compensation for appointed officials in the city of Bell.
The amount of compensation being paid to the chief administrative officer and others in Bell was surprising. The publication of that compensation serves a legitimate public service and provides us the ability to submit these comments:
As retired city managers each with more than 35 years of service to California communities, we must state for the record that the compensation provided to Bell's chief administrative officer is not at all reflective of compensation provided to professional local government managers.
What's more, today many city and county administrators and other officials are not only
deferring compensation increases but are reducing their own salaries and benefits to help local
governments balance budgets.
While the ultimate decision about compensation is the responsibility of local elected officials, it is also the responsibility of professional local government managers to assure that their compensation is within reasonable, acceptable norms.
Local government professional managers should be compensated fairly, equitably and with recognition of services provided.
Compensation in Bell far exceeds these standards.

If anyone should resign, it's the Bell City Council.
As despicable as this compensation may be, it is not the fault of the three individuals in question; they have broken no law or trust.
On the other hand, the members of the City Council did break the trust of the people of Bell by irresponsibly approving these salaries and the lopsided contracts that place the city in its predicament.

Haiti's tragic history lesson
Re "Haiti's ongoing disaster," Editorial, July 19
The Times writes of Haiti's "haphazard and corrupt governance," as if this nation evolved in a vacuum. To understand Haiti's current status,
one must review its
history.
Haiti was founded by kidnapped West Africans who were enslaved by the French. While slavery still thrived in the United States, the Haitians overthrew their slave masters (defeating French, British and Spanish armies in the process) and established their own republic in 1804. As a direct result, France lost two-thirds of its income from trade and was forced to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States for the bargain price of $15 million.
For more than 200 years, the Western world has punished the Haitian people for their successful revolution. Haiti has endured military invasions, gunboat blockades, economic embargoes, trade barriers, diplomatic quarantines, subsidized armed subversions, Western-backed dictators and defamation by the media.
Haiti's misery, poverty and instability are largely due to the collective determination of former
colonists to prevent its success.

Parole in a high-profile case
Re "Where tragedy and fame collided," July 17
I can understand the emotions the Rizzo and Sinatra families have had in the 18 years since Jilly Rizzo's terrible death.
I am struck, however, that with the exception of two of Rizzo's sons, there seems to be nothing in their hearts but the need for revenge against Rizzo's killer, convicted drunk driver Jeffrey Perrotte. Neither Assistant District Atty. Judy Buck, Commissioner Lea Ann Chrones nor the family seem to
have given any thought
to the positive force
Perrotte might be in the community.
Chrones said that Perrotte had "not shown sufficient remorse or insight into how his abuse of alcohol had led to the crime."' Did not his "dozens of letters to alcohol abuse organizations ... about the mistakes he made" count for anything?
I fervently hope that this decision had nothing to do with the status of those who wrote to demand that he not be given parole.

The joys of customer service
Re "Can you elaborate on that?," Opinion, July 21
Mark Steinberg's EBay customer service transcript made my day.
Dealing with EBay's "Live Help Team" is worse than having a tooth extracted.
It is even more interesting if, out of frustration, you ask to speak with a supervisor. The response is: "No, they would only give you the same answer."
I don't know if EBay customer service is a Meg Whitman legacy, but this certainly makes me wonder.
By the way, I also sent a hard-copy letter to Ebay's home office in San Jose in February.
I'm still waiting for a response.

Faith and immigrants
Re "Helping immigrants crosses the faith line,"
July 19
Aside from the gravitas of the architecture and the solemnity of the vespers, the aged demographic of the congregation is what remains most prominently in my memories of attending Mass in Italy.
The contrast between these predominantly elderly women-attended liturgies and the standing-room-only youth services in the U.S. exemplifies the threat of European secularization (not least of all in Italy) to the Catholic Church.
The rise of Islam in Europe, however unwelcome it may be to a largely Christian constituency, is a counterbalance to this secularization.
The fact that the church continues to serve Muslims who emigrate from countries where renovating a crumbling church is against the law reflects the strength of adhering to "general principles" that, at least on an individual basis, have the potential to cultivate mutual respect among otherwise divided neighbors.

Full text: Critics of the Obama administration's decision to sue Arizona over its new law to control illegal immigration accuse the government of overlooking a more obvious target: the dozens of cities that called themselves a "sanctuary" for immigrants.
"Everyone has noticed the hypocrisy of the government going after Arizona and ignoring the sanctuary cities," said Bob Dane, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. "They have it exactly backwards. Arizona is applying federal law, and sanctuary cities are violating it."
Justice Department lawyers on Thursday asked a judge in Phoenix to block Arizona's law from going into effect this week on the grounds it interferes with federal immigration policy. They say the government wants to catch and deport criminal immigrants, but it does not wish to take custody of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who are otherwise abiding by the law.
Beginning in the 1980s, more than 40 cities and counties adopted ordinances or resolutions declaring they were sanctuaries for immigrants. Police and other city employees were told they should not ask about a person's immigration status, and they should not tell federal agents if they learned a person was here illegally.
More recently, many of these cities have backed away from such policies. But there continues to be debate over whether local officials have a duty to alert federal agents about illegal immigrants.
The Justice Department disputes the contention that its policy is hypocritical. "There is a big difference between a state or locality saying they are not going to use their resources to enforce a federal law, as so-called 'sanctuary' cities have done, and a state passing its own immigration policy that actively interferes with federal law," said Tracy Schmaler, a department spokeswoman.
Kris Kobach, the Kansas law professor who drafted the Arizona law, said he particularly objected to cities that have a policy of freeing criminals who are illegal immigrants without notifying federal immigration officials. "It's pretty clear they are breaking the law. And they are doing it with impunity," he said.
He pointed to a provision that Congress added to the immigration laws in 1996. It says that state and local agencies "may not prohibit or in any way restrict" their employees from "sending" information about a person's immigration status to the agency then known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
But Congress did not set a penalty for violations. And since then, neither Republican or Democratic administrations have taken legal action to enforce the provision, according to government officials and immigration lawyers.
Michael Hethmon, a lawyer for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, blames politics and the unusual coalition supporting loose enforcement. "Neither employers nor the ethnic interest groups have wanted these laws enforced," he said. "It's about both immigrants' rights and cheap labor."
But the legal difficulty of enforcing immigration laws goes even further. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative, said the Constitution shields states and localities from federal dictates. "Congress cannot compel the states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program," he said in a 1997 ruling.
Cities with sanctuary policies deny that they shield known criminals from immigration agents.
The Los Angeles Police Department has had a policy for more than 30 years that prohibits officers from initiating contact with someone just to determine whether they are in the U.S. legally. LAPD officials have said the policy encourages illegal immigrants who witness crimes to assist police without fear of being deported.
In the last two years, U.S. immigration officials have launched a new alert system that they believe can solve the problem of deporting criminal immigrants. It also has potential to defuse much of the controversy over "sanctuary" cities. Known as "Secure Communities," it permits federal immigration authorities to scan the fingerprints of newly arrested suspects. Los Angeles County participates in the program.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials downplay the significance of "sanctuary" policies. "None of these municipal laws have yet interfered with our ability to make our streets safer," said Matt Chandler, an agency spokesman.

Full text: Author: Francis Fukuyama
There is a widespread perception of a strong link between immigrants and crime. It is common to hear those who oppose immigration argue that the first act illegal immigrants commit on U.S. soil is to break the law--that is, our immigration laws--and that they are ipso facto criminals who will continue to disregard U.S. laws once in the country. Those making this argument are generally steadfastly opposed to any immigration reform that will provide the 10 million to 12 million illegals already in the country any path to citizenship, on the grounds that such an "amnesty" would reward law-breaking.
The association of immigrants with crime is strengthened by the weekly barrage of news about drug and gang violence in Mexico as the government of Mexican President Felipe CalderÃ³n seeks to crack down on that country's powerful drug mafias. And long before the Mexican drug war, Americans were threatened by Colombian cartels, Salvadoran street gangs, and other criminal groups from Latin America. Moreover, it is perfectly true that the simple fact of being an illegal immigrant induces one to break further laws: One is reluctant to buy mandated auto insurance, pay taxes, or register businesses for fear of deportation.
There is indeed a huge problem of crime originating in Latin America and spilling into the United States. This is almost wholly driven by the enormous demand for drugs from the U.S. There are many things we can and should do to mitigate this problem, but it will persist as long as that demand remains high.
But the problem of gangs and drug violence should not be confounded with the behavior of the vast majority of illegal immigrants to the U.S., who by and large are seeking the same thing that every immigrant to America has wanted since the time of the Mayflower: to better their condition and that of their families. They are not criminals in the sense of people who make a living by breaking the law. They would be happy to live legally, but they come from societies in which legal rules were never quite extended to them. They are therefore better described as "informal" rather than "illegal."
Understanding this distinction requires knowing something about the social order in Latin America or, for that matter, in many other developing countries. These societies are often characterized by sharp class distinctions between a relatively small, well-educated elite and a much broader and poorer population.
The rule of law exists in places like Mexico, Colombia and El Salvador; the problem is that access to the legal system tends to be a privilege of the well-to-do. The vast majority of illegal immigrants to the U.S. come from poor rural areas, or shantytowns in large cities, where the state--in the form of courts, government agencies and the like--is often absent. Registering a small business, or seeking help from the police, or negotiating a contract requires money, time and political influence that the poor do not possess. In many Latin American countries, as much as 70%-80% of the population lives and works in the informal sector.
The lack of legal access does not make everyone in these regions criminals. It simply means that they get by as best they can through informal institutions they themselves create. The Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto has written extensively about the lack of formal property rights, not just in his own country but throughout the developing world. The poor do not hold legal title to their homes, despite having lived in them for years, because of the insuperable barriers the system throws up to formal registration. So they squat in their homes, constantly insecure and unable to use their property as collateral.
The poor are entrepreneurial and form businesses like restaurants and bus companies, but they are unlicensed and don't conform to official safety rules. They and everyone else would be much better off if they could be brought into the formal legal system, but it is a dysfunctional political system that prevents that from happening.
What illegal immigrants to the U.S. have done is to recreate the informal system within our borders. The Americans who hire them are often complicit in this system by not providing benefits or helping them avoid taxes through cash payments. The gardeners and maids and busboys who participate in this game, along with their employers, are indeed breaking the law. But they are in a very different category from the tattooed Salvatrucha gang member who lives by extortion and drug-dealing.
A comprehensive immigration reform that provides hardworking illegal immigrants with an ultimate path to citizenship should not be regarded as rewarding criminal behavior. It should be seen as an effort to move people from a dangerous informal system to one characterized by a modern rule of law.
We need, of course, to control much better the total number of people coming into the country, which can ultimately be done only through stronger enforcement of employment rules. If we can better distinguish between illegal and informal in our political discourse, then we can begin to concentrate our resources on going after those in the immigrant population who are genuinely dangerous criminals.

Biking responsibility
As a driver I am tired of being the fall guy for every irresponsible bike rider out there. If bike riders want the respect of drivers, they need to give respect. I have yet to see a bike rider who stops for lights and stop signs, who doesn't swerve between parked and moving vehicles, who will stop for a pedestrian in a crosswalk, who signals turns, who rides the wrong way on a one-way street and who rides on the sidewalk instead of on the street, among other annoying maneuvers. With the new law it will now be my responsibility if a biker, who doesn't stop for a stop sign, runs into the side of my vehicle. I'm truly tired of bikers thinking they are above the laws. If they don't obey the laws, why should we drivers be at fault? It is also the responsibility of the Chicago police to ticket bikers for breaking the traffic laws as they do drivers of vehicles.

Energy prices
Your article on the Prairie State new coal plant ("Clean coal dream a costly nightmare; Naperville, other suburbs in power-plant deal now face the prospect of rising electricity bills," Page 1, July 11, by Tribune reporter Michael Hawthorne) fails to put the benefits and challenges of any new generation facility in context with contemporary energy choices. The article appears to discredit the project's economic value because construction costs and carbon emissions will affect the future price of energy. In a vacuum these are valid points. But energy choices don't exist in a vacuum.
The municipal investors of Prairie State made a decision to secure long-term, base-load electric power based on facts and options limited to natural gas, coal, nuclear or open-market contracts. Solar and wind power are neither reliable nor sufficiently abundant to satisfy base-load demand. There is no perfect choice here as all have technological, environmental, economic and construction risks. Hawthorne would be doing his readers a better service if he educated consumers on the near certainty that energy prices are going to rise in the future because of a mixture of supply-and-demand issues, as well as increasing government regulation.
These municipalities chose to invest and own part of a coal plant using the best available technology and plentiful Illinois coal. It's too soon to tell if they made the right call or not. However, when the evaluation is done we need to look at it in context of available options to satisfy future energy demands.

Low-cost energy
Prairie State is an outstanding project that will offer reliable, low-cost electricity for decades to come. The Chicago Tribune exaggerates the cost of Prairie State by ignoring comparable inflation in every other major energy sector. Consider two examples: A large, recently proposed nuclear plant would cost $7,100 per kilowatt installed, or 184 percent more than Prairie State, while a coal gasification unit under construction in the Midwest is estimated to cost $4,400 per kilowatt, or 76 percent more than Prairie State.
Prairie State, simply put, is a low-cost energy source. Consider that:
* All base-load power plants have seen significant cost increases related to labor and commodity inflation. A new plant that cost $1 billion in 2000 would cost $2.2 billion a decade later, according to IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
* Natural gas is disadvantaged by extreme price swings and higher costs. The delivered cost of natural gas has been three times higher than coal this past decade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Natural gas also emits carbon dioxide and has been the fastest growing source of power plant CO2 emissions in the United States over the past decade.
* A 2,400-megawatt nuclear plant today could cost a whopping $16 billion to $18 billion to build, many multiples of Prairie State's capital costs.
*Wind is no panacea. Wind doesn't always blow, and wind generation is typically more expensive and demands massive amounts of land. Wind is also inefficient, requiring significant additional backup power plus transmission to get power to plugs.
Coal has been the fastest growing fuel in nearly every year of the past decade around the world. In addition Prairie State brings significant environmental advantages, including much-reduced regulated emissions and a carbon dioxide profile that is 15 to 20 percent lower than current coal-fueled power plants. That's why so many highly informed, practical businesspeople joined Prairie State. And that's why Peabody is proud to be a 5 percent partner in the project.

Arizona's law
It is astounding that columnist Dennis Byrne is able to write more than 700 words based on a misunderstanding of high school-level civics, as he did in "Immigration: A state or federal power?" (Commentary, July 13). Byrne thinks that Arizona can pass its own immigration law because states and localities are already engaging in immigration enforcement. But the federal 287(g) program that he holds up as an example of local engagement is precisely that -- a federal program. States and localities must enter into agreements with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement to participate. The departments and officers must get federal training, and are subject to federal rules, guidance and monitoring.
What they cannot do is set up their own rules and policies, which is what Arizona is doing.
Nor does Byrne's other example, Rhode Island, hold up. The Rhode Island governor's 2008 executive order commands that state offices negotiate agreements with the federal government on immigration enforcement. The Rhode Island State Police entered into a 287(g) agreement with the federal government last year. Those state troopers Byrne mentions are acting under federal rules, not state rules.
Incidentally there are a grand total of zero 287(g) agreements in Illinois. What Byrne refers to when he mentions the five collar counties is another federal program, Secure Communities. Under this program the fingerprints that the police in participating counties send to the FBI to check prior criminal records also go to ICE, which then checks the prints against its databases. The police themselves do not ask about status.
Reviews of 287(g) and Secure Communities reveal that these programs have been inefficient measures for identifying serious criminals -- contrary to what Congress intended and to ICE's own rhetoric. Meanwhile, many police chiefs and law-enforcement associations, including several from Arizona, shun such programs and oppose the Arizona law because they would divert resources from serious crimes and drive wedges between police officers and the communities they are sworn to protect -- and often the victims and witnesses of the criminals they are charged with catching.
As he spotlights the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, Byrne forgets Article VI, the Supremacy Clause: "The Constitution, and the Laws of the United States ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land." The Constitution makes immigration a matter of federal law, so federal immigration laws trump attempts by states or localities to pass their own immigration laws. The federal government must act to fix our nation's broken immigration system. But in the meantime, laws that conflict with federal law -- like Arizona's -- cannot stand.

Full text: Critics of the Obama administration's decision to sue Arizona over its new law to control illegal immigration accuse the government of overlooking a more obvious target: the dozens of cities that called themselves a "sanctuary" for immigrants.
"Everyone has noticed the hypocrisy of the government going after Arizona and ignoring the sanctuary cities," said Bob Dane, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. "They have it exactly backwards. Arizona is applying federal law, and sanctuary cities are violating it."
Unless a judge rules otherwise, the law takes effect Thursday.
Beginning in the 1980s, more than 40 cities and counties -- including Cook County -- adopted ordinances or resolutions declaring they were a sanctuary for immigrants. Police and other city employees were told they should not ask about a person's immigration status, and they should not tell federal agents if they learned a person was here illegally.
More recently, many of these cities have backed away from such policies. But there continues to be disagreement over whether local officials have a duty to alert federal agents about illegal immigrants.
The Justice Department disputes the contention that its policy is hypocritical. "There is a big difference between a state or locality saying they are not going to use their resources to enforce a federal law, as so-called sanctuary cities have done, and a state passing its own immigration policy that actively interferes with federal law," said Tracy Schmaler, a department spokeswoman.
Kris Kobach, the University of Missouri law professor who drafted the Arizona law, said he particularly objected to cities not notifying federal immigration officials before they free criminals who are illegal immigrants. "It's pretty clear they are breaking the law. And they are doing it with impunity," he said.
He pointed to a provision Congress added to the immigration laws in 1996 wherein state and local agencies "may not prohibit or in any way restrict" their employees from "sending" information about a person's immigration status to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
But Congress did not set a penalty for violations. And neither Republican or Democratic administrations have taken legal action to enforce it, according to government officials and immigration lawyers.
Michael Hethmon, a lawyer for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, blames politics and the unusual coalition supporting loose enforcement. "Neither employers nor the ethnic interest groups have wanted these laws enforced," he said. "It's about both immigrants' rights and cheap labor."
But the legal difficulty of enforcing immigration laws goes even further. Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative champion, said the Constitution shields states and localities from dictates from D.C. "Congress cannot compel the states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program," he said in a 1997 ruling.
Cities with sanctuary policies deny they shield known criminals from immigration agents.
The Los Angeles Police Department prohibits officers from initiating contact with people just to determine whether they are in the U.S. legally. LAPD officials say the policy encourages illegal immigrants who witness crimes to assist police without fear of being deported.
In the past two years, U.S. immigration officials launched an alert system that they believe can solve the problem of deporting criminal illegal immigrants. It also has potential to defuse the controversy over "sanctuary" cities. Known as "Secure Communities," it permits federal authorities to scan fingerprints of newly arrested suspects.
Officials at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement downplay the significance of "sanctuary" policies. "None of these municipal laws have yet interfered with our ability to make our streets safer," said Matt Chandler, an agency spokesman.

Full text: DENVER -- Campaigning for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination in Colorado, Ken Buck has harsh words for the voters he is trying to woo.
Americans have demanded more from the federal government than it had means to provide, he says. Now it is time to cut -- deeply. "We are absolutely immoral in this country for putting our greed above [the needs of] future generations," he said at a recent campaign stop.
His "expect less" approach seems to be working.
Mr. Buck, a rural district attorney, has stormed to front-runner status ahead of Colorado's Aug. 10 primary.
Two of three polls released last month showed him with a substantial lead over his better-funded, better-known opponent, former Lt. Gov. Jane Norton, who started the race as the odds-on favorite and is backed by the Republican Party establishment. The third poll showed Ms. Norton ahead.
Mr. Buck's rise has been fueled by tea-party conservatives, who have held scores of meet-and-greet sessions to introduce him to voters in every corner of the state, giving him such a big edge among party activists that Ms. Norton chose to skip the GOP nominating convention this summer. (She got on the ballot by petition instead.) Mr. Buck's tea-party fans praise his independence from the party machine, down-to-earth demeanor and tough stance against illegal immigrants.
"We believe he'll do what he says he'll do," said Margo Knutson, 48 years old, a member of three suburban tea-party groups.
Mr. Buck, 51, said he doesn't define himself as a tea-party candidate, but he does see his campaign as very much in the mold of Nevada's Sharron Angle and Kentucky's Rand Paul, anti-establishment long shots who captured their states' GOP Senate nominations this year.
In an election year in which "outsider" is a coveted credential, Mr. Buck launched his campaign with a vow to remain a perpetual insurgent. If elected, he said at a candidate forum in January, "I will not take an oath to the leadership of the Republican Party." He likes to tell voters that he has no friends in Washington now and doesn't intend to after serving in the Senate.
Ms. Norton responds by pointing out that Mr. Buck, a Princeton University graduate, is hardly a rebel; he has spent most of his career in government service, as a federal prosecutor and district attorney. She has also sought to paint Mr. Buck as a flaky flip-flopper, citing a forum where he suggested the U.S. or Israel should attack Iran, only to later moderate his stance.
"Ken's not a serious candidate. He's proving himself to be a ready-fire-aim candidate," said Josh Penry, Ms. Norton's campaign manager.
Mr. Buck said he is so serious that he sticks to his mantra of spending cuts even when it is unpopular. "I've never heard one person say 'Take my kid's student loans away,'" he said, referring to his stance that the government should get out of the college-loan business. "But it's the reality."
While Mr. Buck touts his straight talk, he has had to backpedal from some statements.
At a forum this spring, he called Social Security "a horrible policy" that may not even be constitutional and said he was fundamentally opposed to government-run retirement benefits.
In a recent interview, he said he had meant to say it was a horrible policy for the government to raid the Social Security trust fund. Mr. Buck said he would consider some privatization of Social Security but wanted to be sure needy seniors retain a safety net.
Though the primary fight has been bitter, the candidates agree on many issues. Both want to raise the eligibility age for Social Security for younger workers; make deep cuts in the Department of Education; overturn the new health-care law; and eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. Mr. Buck has called for privatizing the U.S. Postal Service.
Ms. Norton, who ran Colorado's public-health department before a term as lieutenant governor, wants to impose a means test for Medicare.
The Republican nominee will likely face Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet -- who was appointed to the seat last year after the sitting senator, Ken Salazar, joined President Barack Obama's cabinet as Interior Secretary -- in a race analysts call a toss-up. Republicans have a slight edge over Democrats in voter registration, but nearly a third of Colorado voters are unaffiliated.
One challenge that Mr. Buck might face in a general election: winning over Latinos.
As district attorney in northeast Colorado's Weld County, a largely agricultural region of 255,000, Mr. Buck seized nearly 5,000 records from a tax-preparation firm, seeking evidence of illegal immigrants working under fake Social Security numbers. He charged more than 70 people with identity theft, but most cases were dropped after the state Supreme Court ruled in December that the raid was unconstitutional.
Mr. Buck's actions drew the ire of Hispanics across the state and remain a concern for some voters, said Alci Maldonado, chairwoman of a national group that courts Hispanics on behalf of the Republican Party. Latinos made up about 13% of the Colorado electorate in 2008; nearly 40% backed the Republican presidential ticket, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.
At a recent campaign stop, Mr. Buck compared the plight of illegal immigrants to that of African-Americans before the civil-rights movement, saying, "We have to make sure that we don't create something that's so un-American . . . a group of second-class citizens."
In an interview, Mr. Buck clarified his remarks, saying that he wanted to improve the status of immigrants by forcing those who were here illegally to return home and apply for legal entry into this country.

Full text: VENEZUELA
President Hugo Chavez threatened Sunday to cut off oil sales to the United States if Venezuela is attacked by its U.S.-allied neighbor Colombia in a dispute over allegations that Venezuela gives haven to Colombian rebels.
Chavez made his warning in an outdoor speech to thousands of supporters, saying, "If there is any armed aggression against Venezuela from Colombian territory or anywhere else supported by the Yankee empire, we . . . would suspend shipments of oil to the United States."
If carried out, such a threat would be a titanic economic blow for Chavez's government, which depends heavily on oil sales. The United States is the top buyer of oil from Venezuela, which is its fifth-biggest foreign supplier.
But Colombia has not threatened military action, and it's likely that Chavez issued the warning in part to put Washington and Bogota on notice that he will not stand for a more aggressive international campaign to denounce allegations that leftist Colombian rebels are finding refuge in Venezuela.
Chavez cut off diplomatic relations with Colombia on Thursday after outgoing President Alvaro Uribe's government presented photos, videos and maps of what it said were Colombian rebel camps inside Venezuela. Chavez called it an attempt to smear his government and said Uribe could be trying to lay the groundwork for an armed conflict.

NORTH AFRICA
The leader of al-Qaeda's offshoot in North Africa said in a message broadcast Sunday that the group has killed a French engineer taken hostage in Niger in April.
In an audio message broadcast on al-Jazeera, Abdelmalek Droukdel said the group killed the 78-year-old hostage in retaliation for the killing of six al-Qaeda members in a recent raid by Mauritanian forces aided by the French military.
The hostage, Michel Germaneau, was abducted April 22 in Niger, and officials thought he was subsequently taken to Mali. Al-Qaeda demanded in several Internet messages addressed to President Nicolas Sarkozy that France help negotiate the release of the group's prisoners in countries in the region.
"Sarkozy has [not only] failed to free his compatriot in this failed operation, but he opened the doors of hell for himself and his people," Droukdel said.
"As a quick response to the despicable French act, we confirm that we have killed hostage Germaneau in revenge for our six brothers who were killed in the treacherous operation," he said.
French government officials would not comment on Sunday's audio message.

MEXICO
Guards and officials at a prison in northern Mexico allegedly let inmates out, lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug-related killings, including the massacre of 17 people last week, prosecutors said Sunday.
After carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells, the attorney general's office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption.
"According to witnesses, the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director . . . to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards' weapons for executions," office spokesman Ricardo Najera said at a news conference.
The director of the prison in Gomez Palacios in Durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation.

Bomb in Thailand wounds nine: A bomb at a bus stop in downtown Bangkok wounded nine people Sunday shortly after polls closed in a parliamentary election that pitted a government candidate against a jailed leader of recent mass protests in the Thai capital.
Ancient shipwrecks found off Italy: A team of marine archaeologists using sonar scanners has discovered four ancient shipwrecks off the tiny Italian island of Zannone, with intact cargoes of wine and oil. The remains of the trading vessels, dating from the 1st century B.C. to the 5th-7th century A.D., are up to 165 meters underwater.
Australia to take in fewer immigrants: Australia is heading for a smaller immigration intake over the next few years and the number of foreign students will fall, Sustainable Population Minister Tony Burke told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio Sunday after the opposition coalition pledged to cut immigration.

Full text: Last month, 303 people were murdered in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez, which lies alongside El Paso. This month, the dead include three men killed by a sophisticated, remote-controlled car bomb -- the first in Mexico's drug wars. In a city of 1.2 million, more than 2,600 died violently in 2009; some 200,000 more may have fled.
Meanwhile in Washington, the Government Accountability Office has drawn up a list of assistance promised to Mexico by the United States since 2008, but not delivered. It includes: at least nine Black Hawk helicopters; three Bell helicopters; four airplanes for sea patrolling; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft; 218 polygraph units; two railroad inspection units; mobile gamma radiation trucks; and five training programs, ranging from "financial intelligence" to "drug demand reduction."
Since the end of the Cold War, neglect of Latin America has become something of a fine art in Washington, practiced by Republican and Democratic administrations alike. But even in that context, the disregard for Mexico over the past couple of years is kind of astonishing.
The government of Felipe Calderon -- a pro-American moderate who just barely defeated a leftist populist in the 2006 presidential election -- is locked in a battle with drug cartels that will determine whether the country remains a modernizing democracy or plunges toward failed-state status. For violence and for sheer terror, the war resembles that of Iraq or Afghanistan. More than 50,000 Mexican troops have been deployed to fight the cartels; some 25,000 people have been killed in less than four years. Beheadings have become common, along with massacres, assassinations, gun battles on the street -- and now, car bombs.
The United States has not entirely ignored this crisis. But its efforts to help Calderon's government have been late, paltry and mired in bureaucracy. The Obama administration proposed $10.7 billion for civilian stabilization programs in Afghanistan and Pakistan in its 2011 budget; it requested $300 million in aid to Mexico. Congress has appropriated $3.6 billion for fencing along the U.S.-Mexican border, to keep out illegal immigrants. For the Merida Initiative, the program developed to assist Mexico's counternarcotics campaign, it has approved $1.3 billion since 2008.
As of March, $121 million of that appropriation -- or about 9 percent -- had actually been spent. Much of the rest, according to the GAO, was bogged down in more than a dozen federal agencies. The Mexican government was so frustrated by the delays that it advanced its own money for a anti-money-laundering operation, the report said. The State Department responded by reprogramming the money it had promised but never delivered.
This record of malfeasance is bad enough. But in Mexico's war, the United States also plays the role of supplier to the enemy -- and it does that far more efficiently. At a discussion sponsored by the think tank Third Way in Washington last week, Mexican Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan pointed out that the vast majority of guns and money flowing to the cartels come from the United States, including from 7,000 federally licensed gun stores along the border in Texas and Arizona. Eighty percent of the 75,000 guns seized by the Calderon government over three years came from the United States.
Calderon has pleaded with Congress and two administrations to reinstate the federal ban on assault weapons and to stop the massive illegal sales to Mexicans. Next to no action has been taken, despite Obama's rhetorical support for tougher enforcement. Sarukhan diplomatically noted that southbound inspections of vehicles for guns and cash have finally begun; but so far there have been only a handful of seizures.
The ambassador maintained that despite the red tape and failures of cooperation, "the formal diplomatic, bilateral relationship between Mexico and the United States is as good as it has ever been in the recent past." But "public perceptions on both sides of the border," he added, are something else. They are "running counter to where the formal, bilateral relationship is headed."
"Mexican citizens on my side of the border . . . believe that we're paying a heavy toll for what is basically a U.S. responsibility," Sarukhan said. So will they vote for a presidential candidate who would continue to pay that cost when Calderon's term ends in 2012? The ambassador said he thought so. But he might have added: that may depend on whether the Obama administration and Congress do more to help turn the tide in cities like Ciudad Juarez.

Full text: With the immigration debate heating up -- and a federal court case over Arizona's SB 1070 brewing -- you'd think that the U.S. was besieged by growing numbers of illegal immigrants. But you'd be wrong.
Despite the heightened rhetoric and the bloodcurdling vitriol surrounding the issue, illegal immigration has actually declined significantly over the last few years. Journalists like to characterize the anger over immigration as a response to facts on the ground -- i.e. people are inundated and incensed -- but the numbers don't bear them out.
In fact, the opposite is true. According to a February report by the Department of Homeland Security, the number of illegal immigrants living in the U.S. actually dropped by a whopping 1 million between 2008 and 2009, which amounts to the sharpest drop in 30 years. It was the second year of declining numbers.
And the Border Patrol reports that apprehensions are down by more than 60% since 2000, to 550,000 last year, the lowest in 35 years, even though the border is more tightly controlled than ever. As William Finnegan wrote in last week's New Yorker, "The southern border, far from being 'unsecured,' is in better shape than it has been for years -- better managed and less porous."
And there's more. Despite the drumbeat about hordes of undocumented Mexicans who have come north to take our jobs, consider this: According to the Pew Hispanic Center, between 2005 and 2008, the number of Mexican migrants arriving in the U.S. actually declined by 40%.
It's not only the number of Mexican illegal immigrants that has dropped. The fact that the U.S. economy is struggling has discouraged high-skilled immigrants from around the globe from looking for jobs in America, and the flow of applicants for H1-B visas, or work permits, has slowed. Before the recession, the entire 85,000 H1-B annual quota would be filled within days of the application date on the first of April. For fiscal year 2010, the quota wasn't reached until December 2009.
Finally, the Census Bureau's American Community Survey last fall revealed a historic decline in the percentage of U.S. residents who are foreign-born -- from 12.6% in 2007 to 12.5% in 2008. That represents only about 40,000 people numerically, but it is the first time since the 1970 census -- 40 years ago -- that the foreign-born percentage of the U.S. population has gone down.
So, in the face of all this data showing that legal and illegal immigration is down dramatically, what's all the fuss about? Why has the debate turned so nasty? Why does it seem worse than it did in 1994, during the debate over Proposition 187, California's anti-immigrant ballot measure?
The easy answer, of course, is that the economy is tough and historically people have looked for targets to blame for their feelings of impotence.
But I think there are other contributing factors. The political discourse overall is pretty horrific, and though immigration has always brought out the worst in people, today's polarized climate only makes matters worse.
Further, the right, where much of the anti-immigrant frenzy comes from, no longer has an authoritative voice pressing for decency on the issue. Four years ago, after President Bush unsuccessfully launched his own effort at comprehensive immigration reform, he warned against "harsh, ugly rhetoric." Today, Bush is hardly heard from and the right has an "open borders" policy on over-the-top rhetoric.
Struggling newspapers seeking to engage readers at any cost are also part of the problem. Whereas racist rants were once confined to marginal websites, today many papers -- including this one -- have opened their online comments section to, well, complete nut-jobs. Allowing vitriolic racial rhetoric to remain on a mainstream website is to give it a level of acceptability. Just last week, in response to my column on the so-called burka ban in France, a rabid commenter proposed that all those crossing the U.S.-Mexico border without papers should be shot on sight. Nice. Such "dialogue" not only pushes out reasonable people, it emboldens the unreasonable ones. By allowing it to be posted, newspapers are presiding over the mainstreaming of anti-immigrant hate speech.
There may be those who see hatred as a justifiable means to an end. Perhaps they hope that all this harsh rhetoric will keep even more illegal immigrants at home. But they'd be silly to think that such invective only makes life harder for immigrants. Unfortunately, it also actively degrades our culture, our public square and our democracy.

Full text: There is a widespread perception of a strong link between immigrants and crime. It is common to hear those who oppose immigration argue that the first act illegal immigrants commit on U.S. soil is to break the law -- that is, our immigration laws -- and that they are ipso facto criminals who will continue to disregard U.S. laws once in the country. Those making this argument are generally steadfastly opposed to any immigration reform that will provide the 10 million to 12 million illegals already in the country any path to citizenship, on the grounds that such an "amnesty" would reward law-breaking.
The association of immigrants with crime is strengthened by the weekly barrage of news about drug and gang violence in Mexico as the government of Mexican President Felipe Calderon seeks to crack down on that country's powerful drug mafias. And long before the Mexican drug war, Americans were threatened by Colombian cartels, Salvadoran street gangs, and other criminal groups from Latin America. Moreover, it is perfectly true that the simple fact of being an illegal immigrant induces one to break further laws: One is reluctant to buy mandated auto insurance, pay taxes, or register businesses for fear of deportation.
There is indeed a huge problem of crime originating in Latin America and spilling into the United States. This is almost wholly driven by the enormous demand for drugs from the U.S. There are many things we can and should do to mitigate this problem, but it will persist as long as that demand remains high.
But the problem of gangs and drug violence should not be confounded with the behavior of the vast majority of illegal immigrants to the U.S., who by and large are seeking the same thing that every immigrant to America has wanted since the time of the Mayflower: to better their condition and that of their families. They are not criminals in the sense of people who make a living by breaking the law. They would be happy to live legally, but they come from societies in which legal rules were never quite extended to them. They are therefore better described as "informal" rather than "illegal."
Understanding this distinction requires knowing something about the social order in Latin America or, for that matter, in many other developing countries. These societies are often characterized by sharp class distinctions between a relatively small, well-educated elite and a much broader and poorer population.
The rule of law exists in places like Mexico, Colombia and El Salvador; the problem is that access to the legal system tends to be a privilege of the well-to-do. The vast majority of illegal immigrants to the U.S. come from poor rural areas, or shantytowns in large cities, where the state -- in the form of courts, government agencies and the like -- is often absent. Registering a small business, or seeking help from the police, or negotiating a contract requires money, time and political influence that the poor do not possess. In many Latin American countries, as much as 70%-80% of the population lives and works in the informal sector.
The lack of legal access does not make everyone in these regions criminals. It simply means that they get by as best they can through informal institutions they themselves create. The Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto has written extensively about the lack of formal property rights, not just in his own country but throughout the developing world. The poor do not hold legal title to their homes, despite having lived in them for years, because of the insuperable barriers the system throws up to formal registration. So they squat in their homes, constantly insecure and unable to use their property as collateral.
The poor are entrepreneurial and form businesses like restaurants and bus companies, but they are unlicensed and don't conform to official safety rules. They and everyone else would be much better off if they could be brought into the formal legal system, but it is a dysfunctional political system that prevents that from happening.
What illegal immigrants to the U.S. have done is to recreate the informal system within our borders. The Americans who hire them are often complicit in this system by not providing benefits or helping them avoid taxes through cash payments. The gardeners and maids and busboys who participate in this game, along with their employers, are indeed breaking the law. But they are in a very different category from the tattooed Salvatrucha gang member who lives by extortion and drug-dealing.
A comprehensive immigration reform that provides hardworking illegal immigrants with an ultimate path to citizenship should not be regarded as rewarding criminal behavior. It should be seen as an effort to move people from a dangerous informal system to one characterized by a modern rule of law.
We need, of course, to control much better the total number of people coming into the country, which can ultimately be done only through stronger enforcement of employment rules. If we can better distinguish between illegal and informal in our political discourse, then we can begin to concentrate our resources on going after those in the immigrant population who are genuinely dangerous criminals.

Full text: Had Arizona's governor not just signed the toughest law against illegal immigrants in the nation, the killing of Juan Varela probably would have been written off as just a tragic neighborhood dispute.
The 44-year-old U.S. citizen was watering chile plants in his front yard when a neighbor confronted him and shot him to death, according to police documents.
Varela's brother, Antonio, told police that the neighbor, Gary Kelley, who is white, called Juan Varela by an ethnic slur and said he had to "go back to Mexico" now that Gov. Jan Brewer had signed SB 1070. The family campaigned to publicize the death, culminating with the county prosecutor's decision last month to add a hate-crime allegation to the second-degree murder charges filed against Kelley.
But Kelley's Latino tenant and neighbors say he displayed no racial animus and had criticized the new law as unfair. Most immigrant rights activists have shied away from the case, skeptical that the killing was racially motivated.
To some Arizonans, it's an illustration of how incidents in the state now get interpreted through the prism of the new law.
"When this happened, everyone immediately wanted to make this about 1070," said an exasperated Tommy Thompson, a Phoenix police spokesman who downplayed any racial overtones to Varela's killing.
Tensions are rising here as the clock ticks down to Thursday, the day the law is scheduled to take effect.
Some activists sometimes compare Arizona to the Jim Crow-era South or Nazi Germany, and other groups privately worry about civil unrest. Meanwhile, Brewer has contended that most illegal immigrants entering her state are drug smugglers. (Civil rights groups and the Obama administration have asked a federal judge to halt SB 1070.)
Police departments are still trying to figure out what the complex measure requires their officers to do. The key provisions mandate that police check the immigration status of people they lawfully stop and suspect are in the country illegally. It also makes it a state crime to lack immigration documents.
Some police departments say little may change on Thursday because many officers already check the status of people they believe are committing crimes.
Instead, the biggest effect of the law may be psychological. It marks the enactment of a new state policy, known as attrition through enforcement, to push illegal immigrants out of Arizona by making clear they're not wanted. And it has convinced some Latino citizens, like the Varelas, that they are also under attack.
Juan Varela's parents moved from Texas to south Phoenix in 1952, when cornfields still lay near their small house. They raised 14 children who felt comfortable in the mostly white town.
"I felt like I was just part of society," said Susie Mendoza, one of Juan Varela's sisters. She didn't even teach her children Spanish, which was regularly spoken at home in her childhood.
Juan Varela, who coached a diverse Little League baseball team, was deeply religious and had a troubled past. He was convicted of aggravated assault in 2008 and had spent years on disability. Less than two weeks after Brewer signed SB 1070, he and Antonio Varela, who lived next door, discussed a documentary they had seen about Emmett Till, a black teenager in Mississippi who was killed after reportedly whistling at a white woman in 1955. They saw new relevance in the tragic tale.
"I said, 'Man, if we don't watch ourselves, things are going to be that bad here,' " Antonio Varela recalled. "He said, 'Let's pray on that.' It was constant. Every time you turned to a [television] channel, it was SB 1070."
Days later, on May 6, Antonio drove his mother, who lives with Juan, to the local Kmart. Afterward, as he pulled into the driveway to drop her off, he saw Kelley walking toward his brother in his front yard.
According to police documents, Antonio said he heard Kelley yell, "Go back to Mexico!" and warn Juan that he was going to die if he didn't leave. Juan confronted Kelley on the sidewalk. He kicked at Kelley but missed, Antonio said. Kelley pulled a pistol from his waistband and shot Juan, the documents say.
In an interview, Antonio said Kelley tried to shoot him too, but the gun misfired. Kelley ran to his house and emerged only when police arrived, holding a can of beer, which he poured over his head. According to police documents, Kelley said that Juan Varela had kicked him in the groin and that he was defending himself.
According to police, Kelley, 50, told officers, "I love all people -- white, black or Hispanic, and I am not racist in any way."
Two city councilmen later came to the neighborhood, along with police spokesman Thompson, saying that the killing did not seem racially motivated. They were relying on statements from people like Ana Gutierrez, who said Kelley used to chat with her parents, who were his neighbors, and spent Thanksgiving at their house. She said Kelley told her father days before the shooting that he opposed SB 1070.
"It's just weird to hear them say he's racist," Gutierrez said.
Lydia Guzman, a prominent local immigrants rights activist, said she and others organizing protests against SB 1070 were wary of the case. "This guy did not get shot because he was Mexican," Guzman said. "We are being extra cautious" about making such claims, she added.
The Varela family, baffled that racial elements of the incident have been downplayed, held news conferences demanding hate-crime charges. They said the Phoenix police chief had asked them to stay quiet about the case -- an assertion that is completely inaccurate, according to the department.
In June, family members met with Maricopa County Atty. Richard Romley, who added the hate-crime allegation against Kelley. Romley said at a news conference that the extra allegation, which can enhance the penalties against Kelley, was added because of witness statements. A spokesman for Romley said he could not elaborate.
The Varela family says that the hate-crime allegation is a small comfort but that the public needs to know the threat the new law has created.
"We want the governor to understand that what she's doing is causing crimes to take place," Mendoza said.
Two doors down from the Varela home, Kelley's house is still partly occupied. Fernando Perez, a construction worker, has rented half the house from Kelley for the last year. He said he never heard his landlord make biased remarks. He is skeptical that the immigration law had anything to do with Varela's death, pinning the blame instead on what he believes was a simple dispute.
"Don't blame the law," he said, "if your own actions are to blame."

Immigrant workers in New York City are more likely to have a job than their U.S.-born counterparts, according to a new analysis by an economic policy group.
Some 8.8% of New York immigrants were unemployed in the first five months of this year, compared with 10.9% of U.S.-born workers in the city, according the Fiscal Policy Institute, a left-leaning economic policy group.
Both groups saw their unemployment rate surge in the recession, but labor experts say that some low-wage service jobs have returned to provide some relief to foreign-born workers in the city.
"In tough economic times, immigrants are more likely to send people into the labor force," said James Parrott, deputy director of the Fiscal Policy Institute. "They are likely to take the first job that comes along," he said. Participation in the labor force--the proportion of working-age people who have jobs or are actively looking for one--also favored immigrants. The labor-force participation rate for immigrants in the city was 64.1%, compared with 57.1% for natives.
While industries such as construction and manufacturing still haven't recovered, immigrants might be finding more opportunity doing odd jobs and in part-time work, said Rakesh Kochhar, associate director for research at the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center.
Cecila Negra, 35 years old, is one such immigrant who is working part-time. During the weekend, Ms. Negra, an immigrant from Ecuador, sells ceviche from a cart in her neighborhood of Ozone Park, Queens. She used to work as a taxi driver, but had to give up her job after she had a baby.
Now Ms. Negra sells the Latin-American seafood dish for a living. "I wanted to try it, to see how it was and if I could make money," Ms. Negra said.
In its analysis, the Fiscal Policy Institute examined New York City data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The institute analyzed data from about 13,000 respondents from New York City for the first five months of 2008 and 2010. Economists caution that the data can be skewed due to its sample size, which includes a mix of legal and undocumented immigrants.
New York's jobless figures mirrored recent national trends. The Labor Department reported earlier this month that the national unemployment rate for June was 8.7% for immigrants and 9.8% for native-born workers.
The national jobless data, however, indicate a demographic shift. From 2004 to 2008, the national jobless rate for immigrant workers matched or was lower than that of U.S.-born workers. In 2009 and for the first three months of this year, it was higher than that of natives.
"Immigrants got displaced early on from construction and some of them have found other jobs in other sectors, or have left the country, or more likely, new immigrants that would have come for those jobs didn't come," Mr. Parrott said.
Low-wage service jobs in sectors reliant on immigrants, such as the restaurant and retail industries, have seen growth in the city. Several thousand restaurant and retail jobs have been added in the city this year.
While immigrants appear to be finding more work more easily than native-born workers in New York, their jobless rate remains high. During the first five months of 2008, the unemployment rate for immigrants in the city was 4%, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute's analysis.
Jobs for domestic workers, another industry reliant on immigrant labor, remain scarce in 2010, said Priscilla Gonzalez, director of Domestic Workers United, a coalition of housekeepers and caregivers. Many immigrants who were working as domestic workers are taking odd jobs to make ends meet, she said.
"In the wake of the economic crisis, they have really borne the brunt of the financial meltdown," Ms. Gonzalez said.

DENVER--Six months ago, former GOP Rep. Tom Tancredo was cheered at the National Tea Party Convention. On Monday, he announced a third-party run for governor of Colorado--and many in the state's tea-party movement responded with disdain.
Although Mr. Tancredo's support for sealing the U.S. border against illegal immigrants, slashing government spending and taking on the Republican Party's elite have resonated with tea-party activists, his decision to run for governor as the candidate of the tiny American Constitution Party set many of his former fans fuming.
Given Mr. Tancredo's stated opposition to third-party candidacies, "this seems like an enormous power grab," said Lesley Hollywood, director of the Northern Colorado Tea Party. "He's making a mockery out of himself and the entire election process."
Republicans in Colorado say Mr. Tancredo is sure to siphon off enough conservative votes to hand the election to the Democratic candidate, squandering what the GOP once saw as a golden opportunity to take back the governor's mansion. "He wants to destroy Republican chances," said Dick Wadhams, the GOP state chairman.
Mr. Tancredo said in an interview Monday that he jumped into the race because, in his view, neither candidate running in the Aug. 10 GOP primary had any chance to win in November.
Many tea-party members are not fond of the likely GOP nominee, former Rep. Scott McInnis, because they consider him too close to the Republican establishment. Mr. McInnis's campaign also has been hurt by his recent acknowledgment that he inadvertently plagiarized portions of a series of articles on water policy.
But some view Mr. Tancredo's jump into the race as hypocritical. Last December, as tea-party activists were discussing the 2010 elections, Mr. Tancredo urged them not to back third-party candidates. "Such a course is suicidal," he counseled in a letter, instructing them to work instead within the GOP.
Tea-party activists, many of them new to politics, said they had worked hard for months to learn the political system, recruit candidates, gain clout within the state GOP and press the issues they care most about. For Mr. Tancredo to step in two weeks before the primary with his own agenda "is a kick in the teeth, frankly," said Nikki Mata, co-founder of R Block Party, a conservative group in Centennial, Colo. Over the weekend, a coalition of 21 groups linked to the tea party and representing thousands of voters urged Mr. Tancredo to reconsider.
"They are mad, that's for sure," Mr. Tancredo said. But he added that he hoped to win them over before November by appealing to their insurgent spirit, and by emphasizing his intent to "go after the size of government with hammer and tong."
Mr. Tancredo, who dropped plans to run for the GOP nomination last fall and backed Mr. McInnis for months, now dismisses him as unelectable after the plagiarism scandal. And he has disparaged Mr. McInnis's lone rival for the nomination, political novice and small-business owner Dan Maes, who has tea-party backing but very little money.
Mr. Tancredo said he concluded that he alone had a decent shot of carrying the conservative banner into the gubernatorial mansion. His fiery calls to deport all illegal immigrants have earned him a small but ardent national following, and he has a proven ability to raise campaign funds.
He also has strong name recognition in Colorado from his five terms in Congress. A Denver Post poll published July 17 gave registered Republicans six names and asked who would be their party's strongest gubernatorial candidate. Mr. Tancredo came out on top, with 29%.
Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper is the Democratic candidate to succeed Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat who surprised the state's political establishment by deciding not to run for a second term.

Tough Talk Pays Off for Colorado Senate Hopeful; Voters' Receptiveness to Ken Buck's Advice to'Expect Less' From Government Puts Him in Top Spot Heading Into August Primary

DENVER--Campaigning for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination in Colorado, Ken Buck has harsh words for the voters he is trying to woo.
Americans have demanded more from the federal government than it had means to provide, he says. Now it is time to cut--deeply. "We are absolutely immoral in this country for putting our greed above [the needs of] future generations," he said at a recent campaign stop.
His "expect less" approach seems to be working.
Mr. Buck, a rural district attorney, has stormed to front-runner status ahead of Colorado's Aug. 10 primary. Two of three polls released last month showed him with a substantial lead over his better-funded, better-known opponent, former Lt. Gov. Jane Norton, who started the race as the odds-on favorite and is backed by the Republican Party establishment. The third poll showed Ms. Norton ahead.
Mr. Buck's rise has been fueled by tea-party conservatives, who have held scores of meet-and-greet sessions to introduce him to voters in every corner of the state, giving him such a big edge among party activists that Ms. Norton chose to skip the GOP nominating convention this summer. (She got on the ballot by petition instead.) Mr. Buck's tea-party fans praise his independence from the party machine, down-to-earth demeanor and tough stance against illegal immigrants.
"We believe he'll do what he says he'll do," said Margo Knutson, 48 years old, a member of three suburban tea-party groups.
Mr. Buck, 51, said he doesn't define himself as a tea-party candidate, but he does see his campaign as very much in the mold of Nevada's Sharron Angle and Kentucky's Rand Paul, anti-establishment long shots who captured their states' GOP Senate nominations this year.
In an election year in which "outsider" is a coveted credential, Mr. Buck launched his campaign with a vow to remain a perpetual insurgent. If elected, he said at a candidate forum in January, "I will not take an oath to the leadership of the Republican Party." He likes to tell voters that he has no friends in Washington now and doesn't intend to after serving in the Senate.
Ms. Norton responds by pointing out that Mr. Buck, a Princeton University graduate, is hardly a rebel; he has spent most of his career in government service, as a federal prosecutor and district attorney. She has also sought to paint Mr. Buck as a flaky flip-flopper, citing a forum where he suggested the U.S. or Israel should attack Iran, only to later moderate his stance.
"Ken's not a serious candidate. He's proving himself to be a ready-fire-aim candidate," said Josh Penry, Ms. Norton's campaign manager.
Mr. Buck said he is so serious that he sticks to his mantra of spending cuts even when it is unpopular. "I've never heard one person say 'Take my kid's student loans away,' " he said, referring to his stance that the government should get out of the college-loan business. "But it's the reality."
While Mr. Buck touts his straight talk, he has had to backpedal from some statements.
At a forum this spring, he called Social Security "a horrible policy" that may not even be constitutional and said he was fundamentally opposed to government-run retirement benefits.
In a recent interview, he said he had meant to say it was a horrible policy for the government to raid the Social Security trust fund. Mr. Buck said he would consider some privatization of Social Security but wanted to be sure needy seniors retain a safety net.
Though the primary fight has been bitter, the candidates agree on many issues. Both want to raise the eligibility age for Social Security for younger workers; make deep cuts in the Department of Education; overturn the new health-care law; and eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. Mr. Buck has called for privatizing the U.S. Postal Service. Ms. Norton, who ran Colorado's public-health department before a term as lieutenant governor, wants to impose a means test for Medicare.
The Republican nominee will likely face Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet-- who was appointed to the seat last year after the sitting senator, Ken Salazar, joined President Barack Obama's cabinet as Interior Secretary--in a race analysts call a toss-up. Republicans have a slight edge over Democrats in voter registration, but nearly a third of Colorado voters are unaffiliated.
One challenge that Mr. Buck might face in a general election: winning over Latinos.
As district attorney in northeast Colorado's Weld County, a largely agricultural region of 255,000, Mr. Buck seized nearly 5,000 records from a tax-preparation firm, seeking evidence of illegal immigrants working under fake Social Security numbers. He charged more than 70 people with identity theft, but most cases were dropped after the state Supreme Court ruled in December that the raid was unconstitutional.
Mr. Buck's actions drew the ire of Hispanics across the state and remain a concern for some voters, said Alci Maldonado, chairwoman of a national group that courts Hispanics on behalf of the Republican Party. Latinos made up about 13% of the Colorado electorate in 2008; nearly 40% backed the Republican presidential ticket, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.
At a recent campaign stop, Mr. Buck compared the plight of illegal immigrants to that of African-Americans before the civil-rights movement, saying, "We have to make sure that we don't create something that's so un-American...a group of second-class citizens."
In an interview, Mr. Buck clarified his remarks, saying that he wanted to improve the status of immigrants by forcing those who were here illegally to return home and apply for legal entry into this country.

THE NATION; Warming could fuel immigration

Abstract: "Assuming that the climate projections are correct, gradually over the next several decades heading toward the end of the century, it becomes one of the more important factors in driving Mexicans across the border, all other things being equal," said study author Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University.

Full text: Climbing temperatures are expected to raise sea levels and increase droughts, floods, heat waves and wildfires. Now, scientists are predicting another consequence of climate change: mass migration to the United States.
Between 1.4 million and 6.7 million Mexicans could migrate to the U.S. by 2080 as climate change reduces agricultural production in Mexico, says a study published online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The number could amount to 10% of the current Mexican population ages 15 to 65.
"Assuming that the climate projections are correct, gradually over the next several decades heading toward the end of the century, it becomes one of the more important factors in driving Mexicans across the border, all other things being equal," said study author Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University.
Of course, Oppenheimer acknowledged, changes could occur in U.S. immigration policy or in Mexico's economy and its reliance on agriculture. But he said this was a simplified first step in studying the effect of global warming on migration.
"Our primary objectives were, No. 1, to give policymakers something to think about and, No. 2, to give researchers a spur to start answering some of the more complicated questions," Oppenheimer said.
Oppenheimer and economists Alan B. Krueger and Shuaizhang Feng looked at Mexican emigration, crop yield and climate data from 1995 to 2005 to make estimates about the next 70 years.
In the past, Oppenheimer said, Mexican farmers fled north when they could no longer grow their crops. If the rising temperatures dry out the land and reduce yield as expected, many more could do the same.
Philip Martin, an expert in agricultural economics at UC Davis, said that he hadn't read the study but that basing estimates solely on climate change was virtually impossible. "It is just awfully hard to separate climate change from the many, many other factors that affect people's decisions whether to stay in agriculture or move," he said.
In the last 20 years, the percentage of people who live in Mexico's rural areas has declined, Martin said. But much of that is because of economic growth. "As countries get richer, people leave agriculture," he said.
Nevertheless, Martin agreed that global warming could make farming more difficult and lead to more emigration.
Douglas Massey, a sociology professor at Princeton, also agreed but said much of that would depend on demand in the U.S. "Environmental change is not going to produce migrants from Mexico unless there are jobs to go to," he said in an e-mail.

Full text: Doris Meissner and James W. Ziglar's July 22 op-ed piece, "Why the U.S. had to challenge Arizona on immigration," misstated the facts about Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That section of law establishes a mechanism for formal cooperation between the Department of Homeland Security and state and local law enforcement agencies. Then-Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) and I wrote the law.
Ms. Meissner and Mr. Ziglar asserted that Arizona's immigration enforcement law "appears to go well beyond the intent of 287(g)." They also claimed that the federal government "must expressly delegate . . . authority" to states that wish to aid in the enforcement of our immigration laws.
In fact, paragraph 10 of section 287(g) specifically provides for the type of law that Arizona has enacted. It states: "Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an agreement . . . in order for any officer of a State . . . to communicate with the [Secretary of Homeland Security] regarding the immigration status of any individual . . . or otherwise to cooperate with the [Secretary] in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States."
The writers may be unfamiliar with Section 287(g) because they only entered into two such agreements in their nine combined years at the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Full text: DENVER -- Six months ago, former GOP Rep. Tom Tancredo was cheered at the National Tea Party Convention. On Monday, he announced a third-party run for governor of Colorado -- and many in the state's tea-party movement responded with disdain.
Although Mr. Tancredo's support for sealing the U.S. border against illegal immigrants, slashing government spending and taking on the Republican Party's elite have resonated with tea-party activists, his decision to run for governor as the candidate of the tiny American Constitution Party set many of his former fans fuming.
Given Mr. Tancredo's stated opposition to third-party candidacies, "this seems like an enormous power grab," said Lesley Hollywood, director of the Northern Colorado Tea Party. "He's making a mockery out of himself and the entire election process."
Republicans in Colorado say Mr. Tancredo is sure to siphon off enough conservative votes to hand the election to the Democratic candidate, squandering what the GOP once saw as a golden opportunity to take back the governor's mansion. "He wants to destroy Republican chances," said Dick Wadhams, the GOP state chairman.
Mr. Tancredo said in an interview Monday that he jumped into the race because, in his view, neither candidate running in the Aug. 10 GOP primary had any chance to win in November.
Many tea-party members are not fond of the likely GOP nominee, former Rep. Scott McInnis, because they consider him too close to the Republican establishment. Mr. McInnis's campaign also has been hurt by his recent acknowledgment that he inadvertently plagiarized portions of a series of articles on water policy.
But some view Mr. Tancredo's jump into the race as hypocritical. Last December, as tea-party activists were discussing the 2010 elections, Mr. Tancredo urged them not to back third-party candidates. "Such a course is suicidal," he counseled in a letter, instructing them to work instead within the GOP.
Tea-party activists, many of them new to politics, said they had worked hard for months to learn the political system, recruit candidates, gain clout within the state GOP and press the issues they care most about. For Mr. Tancredo to step in two weeks before the primary with his own agenda "is a kick in the teeth, frankly," said Nikki Mata, co-founder of R Block Party, a conservative group in Centennial, Colo. Over the weekend, a coalition of 21 groups linked to the tea party and representing thousands of voters urged Mr. Tancredo to reconsider.
"They are mad, that's for sure," Mr. Tancredo said. But he added that he hoped to win them over by appealing to their insurgent spirit, and by emphasizing his intent to "go after the size of government with hammer and tong."
Mr. Tancredo, who dropped plans to run for the GOP nomination last fall and backed Mr. McInnis for months, now dismisses him as unelectable after the plagiarism scandal. And he has disparaged Mr. McInnis's lone rival for the nomination, political novice and small-business owner Dan Maes, who has tea-party backing but very little money.
Mr. Tancredo said he concluded that he alone had a decent shot of carrying the conservative banner into the gubernatorial mansion. His fiery calls to deport all illegal immigrants have earned him a small but ardent national following, and he has a proven ability to raise campaign funds.
He also has strong name recognition in Colorado from his five terms in Congress. A Denver Post poll published July 17 gave registered Republicans six names and asked who would be their party's strongest gubernatorial candidate. Mr. Tancredo came out on top, with 29%.
Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper is the Democratic candidate to succeed Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat who surprised the state's political establishment by deciding not to run for a second term.

Full text: Immigrant workers in New York City are more likely to have a job than their U.S.-born counterparts, according to a new analysis by an economic policy group.
Some 8.8% of New York immigrants were unemployed in the first five months of this year, compared with 10.9% of U.S.-born workers in the city, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute, a left-leaning economic policy group.
Both groups saw their unemployment rate surge in the recession, but labor experts say that some low-wage service jobs have returned to provide some relief to foreign-born workers in the city.
"In tough economic times, immigrants are more likely to send people into the labor force," said James Parrott, deputy director of the Fiscal Policy Institute. "They are likely to take the first job that comes along," he said. Participation in the labor force -- the proportion of working-age people who have jobs or are actively looking for one -- also favored immigrants. The labor-force participation rate for immigrants in the city was 64.1%, compared with 57.1% for natives.
While industries such as construction and manufacturing still haven't recovered, immigrants might be finding more opportunity doing odd jobs and in part-time work, said Rakesh Kochhar, associate director for research at the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center.
Cecila Negra, 35 years old, is one such immigrant who is working part-time. During the weekend, Ms. Negra, an immigrant from Ecuador, sells ceviche from a cart in her neighborhood of Ozone Park, Queens. She used to work as a taxi driver, but had to give up her job after she had a baby.
Now Ms. Negra sells the Latin-American seafood dish for a living. "I wanted to try it, to see how it was and if I could make money," Ms. Negra said.
In its analysis, the Fiscal Policy Institute examined New York City data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The institute analyzed data from about 13,000 respondents from New York City for the first five months of 2008 and 2010. Economists caution that the data can be skewed due to its sample size, which includes a mix of legal and undocumented immigrants.
New York's jobless figures mirrored recent national trends. The Labor Department reported earlier this month that the national unemployment rate for June was 8.7% for immigrants and 9.8% for native-born workers.
The national jobless data, however, indicate a demographic shift. From 2004 to 2008, the national jobless rate for immigrant workers matched or was lower than that of U.S.-born workers. In 2009 and for the first three months of this year, it was higher than that of natives.
Low-wage service jobs in sectors reliant on immigrants, such as the restaurant and retail industries, have seen growth in the city. Several thousand restaurant and retail jobs have been added in the city this year.
While immigrants appear to be finding more work more easily than native-born workers in New York, their jobless rate remains high. During the first five months of 2008, the unemployment rate for immigrants in the city was 4%, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute's analysis.
Jobs for domestic workers, another industry reliant on immigrant labor, remain scarce in 2010, said Priscilla Gonzalez, director of Domestic Workers United, a coalition of housekeepers and caregivers. Many immigrants who were working as domestic workers are taking odd jobs to make ends meet, she said.
"In the wake of the economic crisis, they have really borne the brunt of the financial meltdown," Ms. Gonzalez said.

Full text: Yahye Wehelie, 26, born and raised in Fairfax County, was supposed to have been home this spring, telling friends and family about his 18-month stay in Yemen: the technology classes, his quest for a Muslim bride, the wedding and reception that featured a DJ playing music by Michael Jackson and Celine Dion.
Instead, while on his way home in early May, Wehelie was stopped while changing planes in Cairo. It turns out he had been placed on the U.S. government's no-fly list. From that moment until last weekend, Wehelie, a graduate of Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, was stranded in Egypt, shuttling between a $16-a-night Cairo hotel room and a windowless room at the U.S. Embassy. There, he said, FBI special agents fed him Oreos and chips and told him he might never see Virginia again.
In his first extensive interview since his return home July 17, Wehelie said the FBI peppered him with questions about possible ties to terrorists. In about six exhausting sessions over his 11 weeks in Egypt, agents made Wehelie log his daily activities dating back several months. They asked whether he was a "devout" Muslim. They probed about connections he might have to Islamic radicals, including Sharif Mobley, an alleged al-Qaeda recruit from New Jersey whom Wehelie met on a street in Yemen.
And then their tone changed, morphing into entreaties to help protect his native land: Might Wehelie consider being a mole in the Muslim community when he got home?
"I've lived in Virginia my whole life," Wehelie said, dressed in loose jeans and a striped Ralph Lauren shirt. "I listen to rap. I play basketball. I watch football. I wasn't brought up the way these crazy people [terrorists] are brought up. I just want to live on with my life. I don't want to be an informant. I want to work for an IT company. I want to be a normal person."
Wehelie -- who says he was in Yemen because his mother sent him to learn Arabic and find a Muslim wife -- sees his experience as what could be described as a Kafkaesque ordeal in which he agonized for weeks over how to prove that he was no threat to his native land. But the government says it must maintain a tight watch over those who may have had contact with known terrorists, and Yemen has been a special point of concern in law enforcement circles of late.
Since Christmas, when a Nigerian man who had trained in Yemen tried to blow up an airplane landing in Detroit, about 30 Muslim Americans have been restricted from leaving, returning to or traveling within the United States, according to a log kept by the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations.
"Several recent high-profile attempted terror plots against U.S. targets, including the attempted Christmas Day attack and the Times Square incident, remind us of the need to remain vigilant and thoroughly investigate every lead to fend off any potential threats," said Paul Bresson, an FBI spokesman, who declined to address Wehelie's case specifically. "The American public correctly demands that of us."
Bresson said the "FBI is always careful to protect the civil rights and privacy concerns of all Americans. . . . We are very mindful of the fact that our success in enforcing the law depends on partnerships with the Muslim community and many other communities."
Federal prosecutors in Alexandria and the FBI are still investigating Wehelie, according to his attorney, Tom Echikson. The family met Thursday with government officials, but Echikson would not discuss the talks. He said he is trying to get Wehelie removed from the no-fly list.
Peter Carr, a spokesman for the U.S attorney's office in Alexandria, said he could not confirm or deny any investigation into Wehelie's activities.
Wehelie's parents, Shamsa Noor and Abdirizak Wehelie -- Somali immigrants who studied at the University of the District of Columbia -- said they had been worried about the second-oldest of their six children, who they thought seemed adrift.
Yahye Wehelie had dropped out of Norfolk State University. By 2008, when he was working as a DHL delivery man, his parents urged him to learn Arabic so he could launch a more lucrative career and maybe find a Muslim wife.
Wehelie, who likes playing Xbox video games and reading Slam and Sports Illustrated magazines, pushed back.
"I was thinking, no, I didn't want to do it. . . . I didn't need to go to a foreign country to learn no foreign language," he said. "I was scared. I went on YouTube to see some clips of Yemen and didn't like what I had seen. I was like, man, this place is in the Stone Ages. I got mad. I actually got depressed.
"How could I match up with someone in Yemen?" Wehelie remembered complaining. "They won't understand American culture. I was going to have to man up."
In October 2008, Wehelie boarded a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight from Dulles and was soon ensconced in Yemeni society. He enrolled at Lebanese International University in Sanaa, the capital. He rented a one-bedroom apartment, played basketball and visited Internet cafes. Soon, he found a bride, a Somali refugee a few years his junior. Maryam was the sister of a friend of a friend -- a nurse.
He thought she was cute. They both liked spaghetti and walks in the park. More important, she made him curious about his Somali heritage.
"Other women who want to meet Americans are like, 'Oh, he'll bring me back to the States,' " he said. "She wasn't like that. . . . She wanted her Somali culture -- and I wanted to get back to that, too."
A year after Wehelie arrived in Yemen, the couple married. Some of his family showed up, including his youngest brother, Yusuf, who wound up staying long-term. Guests danced to Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean." The couple posed in their wedding attire -- Yahye in a dark suit, Maryam in a gown with flowing train -- for souvenir photographs emblazoned with the words "With Love."
Soon, Wehelie got homesick. He wanted to return to the United States to file for permission to bring his wife home. Early this May, he and his brother boarded an EgyptAir flight to Cairo, where they expected to switch to a flight to New York.
But at the Cairo airport, airline officials told the brothers they couldn't make the transfer. They were directed to the U.S. Embassy.
Mystified, the brothers jumped into a cab, thinking the detour would last half an hour and they'd still make their flight. But at the embassy, they were told to wait, go get some lunch. When the brothers got back from Hardee's, they were told that FBI agents from Washington were flying in to see them.
Wehelie borrowed a cellphone and called his mother to say he might be delayed by up to four days. The brothers shuffled off to the nearby Garden City House Hotel, paying with money the U.S. government lent them. The brothers were given coupons for fast-food restaurants and plenty of time to check out the Nile and the Pyramids. After a few days, Yusuf was cleared to go home, but Yahye had to stay.
Wehelie said he met with two FBI agents in a small room at the embassy. The agents -- a man and a woman -- asked a barrage of questions: Do you pray every day? Have you ever met the following people? He took a polygraph test. He handed over passwords to his e-mail and Facebook accounts.
"The FBI, you think they're smart, but these people . . . they'll ask you the stupidest questions that are so irrelevant," Wehelie said. "I am cool with them trying to make screenings safe for my country and all U.S. citizens. I just think in my case, it took a little longer."
Back home in Burke, where the walls are decorated with artwork featuring the Koran, Wehelie's mother said she "felt guilty. I would wake up at 3 a.m. and pray to God to help me. I sent him there to be a better person for this country."
But in Cairo, the FBI's questions seemed designed to examine her son's possible ties to people with very different loyalties. When they showed Wehelie photographs of radicals, one looked familiar, if only vaguely. It was Sharif Mobley, a U.S. citizen accused of killing a hospital guard in Yemen after Mobley was arrested in a sweep of suspected al-Qaeda militants.
Wehelie told The Washington Post that he met Mobley once at random in Sanaa on Hadda Street, a popular spot for foreigners, but knew nothing about his past.
"I don't consider myself knowing this guy," he said. "I met him outside on Hadda Street. He came up to me and said, 'Are you American?' I said, 'Yeah, I am.' 'Well, cool dude, where are you from?' It was small talk."
As his sessions with the FBI wound down, Wehelie said, agents asked whether he might attend mosque services in the Washington area and report back on potential terrorist plots or security threats.
"I was like, 'Man, I don't know,' " he said. "It was very weird. I don't think that's right."
Finally, on July 17, Wehelie was allowed to fly to New York, but because he's still on the no-fly list, he could not continue on to Washington, so his parents picked him up at John F. Kennedy International Airport and drove him home. By morning, he was back playing video games on his Xbox.
Now he wonders whether he'll see the female FBI agent again. In Egypt, she told him she'd like to take him out for a meal -- "for a chitchat" -- when he got home.
"I said, 'Cool, it depends on if I have free time,' " Wehelie recalled. "I didn't want to be rude. I am willing to talk if it coincides with my schedule."

Arizona authorities battling the Obama administration over the state's new immigration law may face an unforeseen obstacle in enforcing the measure: While local police can arrest illegal immigrants, only the federal government can deport them.
Because the federal immigration-enforcement agency has suggested it won't necessarily cooperate in helping meet the law's goal, local police could be forced to choose between holding detainees in their own jails or releasing them.
The Arizona law, which takes effect Thursday, makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and requires police who stop people for such routine infractions as speeding to check their immigration status if there is "reasonable suspicion" they are here unlawfully. The police can detain them while clarifying their status, but deportation can only be conducted by federal authorities.
On Tuesday, Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Securtity--which houses U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement--said the priorities for federal enforcement apply to recent border crossers, felony re-entry cases and serious criminals who pose a public-safety risk.
Police officers in Arizona and across the U.S. currently have the capability to contact ICE to verify the immigration status of people they stop. The agency then confirms whether a person is deportable. If the person doesn't fall into a priority category, they might be issued a notice to appear before an immigration judge but wouldn't be detained by the federal government. That means the individual could remain in the country for months or years while they fight their removal.
Arizona is home to about 460,000 illegal immigrants, according to the DHS. If the new law goes into effect--a challenge by the Obama administration is pending before a judge--police could shower ICE with calls. Without its cooperation, police likely would have to release suspects, because the law doesn't give them the authority to detain an individual indefinitely based on suspicion of unlawful presence in the U.S.
To achieve the law's stated goal of attrition through enforcement, "ICE needs to play with us," said John Harris, president of the Arizona Association of Police Chiefs. "Without ICE, it makes it much more difficult for us to arrest people."
Asked about its plans regarding Arizona's new law, the agency said that "ICE is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that focuses first on criminal aliens who pose a threat to our communities." It added that the outcome of the Justice Department's challenge to the law--on grounds that immigration enforcement is the purview of the federal government--"will inform the government's actions going forward."
ICE now works with local law enforcement in Arizona and other states. For example, illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes normally are turned over to the agency after completing sentences for state crimes. The agency also has agreements with more than 70 localities that empower about 1,200 personnel, who have received special training, to verify the status of immigrants.
Arizona's law would require the state's 15,000 local law-enforcement officers to check the status of those they suspect are in the U.S. illegally.
Juan Pedrosa, an immigration -policy researcher at the nonpartisan Urban Instititute, said ICE's response would be crucial because it is being closely watched by other state lawmakers seeking to promote the arrest and deportation of large numbers of illegal immigrants.
About 11 million illegal immigrants are believed to live in the U.S. In a June 30 memo to ICE employees, agency chief John Morton said it had the capability to remove "less than 4% of the estimated illegal alien population in the United States."
A record 387,790 people were deported from the U.S. in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. ICE removed 81,429 in Arizona, including 23,550 criminals. Mr. Morton has said he opposes Arizona's law because it isn't the role of states to draft their own responses to illegal immigration.
In a declaration with the federal lawsuit, David Palmatier, head of ICE's Law Enforcement Support Center, said an increase in queries from Arizona "will delay response times...and risks exceeding the capacity of the center to respond to higher priority requests for criminal alien status determination."

Arizona's new anti-immigration law, which goes into effect on July 29, has been a rallying point for many conservatives. It reinvigorated the lackluster administration of Arizona's Republican governor, Jan Brewer, and has earned enthusiastic support from tea party activists in Arizona and elsewhere. But many aspects of the law should give conservatives cause for alarm.
The problems begin in Section 2 of the law, which grants all legal residents the power to sue any state agency or official that they believe is failing to enforce immigration laws. This provision will funnel millions of dollars to trial lawyers and put Arizona police officers in a no-win situation.
As 19-year Phoenix Police Department veteran David Salgado has said, enforcing the law could get him sued by the federal government for violating civil-rights protections, while failing to enforce the law could get him sued by anti-immigration activists. Two county sheriffs in Arizona have already created funds to cover their departments against the lawsuits that will inevitably come, undermining law enforcement and enriching trial lawyers along the way.
Worse, deputizing all of Arizona's police officers as federal immigration agents will make their jobs more difficult and dangerous. This is because unauthorized immigrants would be all the more reluctant to report crimes or work with police as witnesses. As William Bratton, the former police chief in Los Angeles and Boston, has said, officers "can't prevent or solve crimes if victims or witnesses are unwilling to talk to us for fear of being deported."
Business owners also have much to fear from Arizona's law. Sections 7 and 8 reaffirm the 2007 Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA), which mandated that all businesses in the state use the faulty E-Verify system that, according to a 2010 audit from Westat, fails to identify undocumented workers 54% of the time. LAWA also mandated stiff sanctions against employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers. (The U.S. Chamber of Commerce will soon challenge the constitutionality of LAWA before the Supreme Court on the grounds that it pre-empts the federal government's immigration power.)
Building on LAWA, Arizona's new law enacts a two-strike policy under which second-time business offenders lose their business licenses. Thus a law championed by conservatives makes it harder for businesses to do what they are supposed to: lower costs and pass savings on to consumers.
Immigrant scientists, entrepreneurs and laborers bring innovation, dedication and good old-fashioned hard work to bear on improving their own lives and the lives of others around them. Removing restrictions on the movement of labor--which primarily serve to protect labor unions and assuage nativists--would be an enormous boon to the national economy.
Arizona's law is popular partly because Arizonans fear an illegal immigrant crime wave. But crime rates in Arizona are at historic lows. According to the state Bureau of Justice, violent crime rates in 2008 (the latest year for which data are available) were lower than any point since 1976. Property crime rates have declined even more steeply, with 2008 figures lower than at any point since 1966. It is a myth, then, that illegal immigrants bring a wave of crime in their wake.
Arizona's new enforcement measures won't solve the problems of unauthorized immigration and the black market in labor. Solutions will come only from expanding legal immigration--by removing barriers to the movement of people across borders (except those for keeping out criminals, potential terrorists, and people with infectious diseases).
Without expanded legal immigration, laws like Arizona's will continue to have troubling and unforeseen effects on police officers, businesses and others.

Full text: As a judge weighs whether to halt Arizona's controversial immigration law, hundreds of Los Angeles union members and activists are planning a bus caravan to Phoenix on Thursday -- the day the law is set to take effect.
More than 550 people plan to ride on 11 buses to Arizona to stage a protest and launch a partnership with Arizona groups to boost voter registration. During the one-day trip, sponsored by the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, participants will meet with Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris, march to the state Capitol and hold a vigil. The participants represent 32 unions.
SB 1070, signed into law by Gov. Jan Brewer in April and supported by a majority of Arizona residents, makes it a state crime to lack immigration documents and requires police to determine the immigration status of people they lawfully stop and subsequently suspect are in the country illegally.
"As Californians and Angelenos, we want to see how we can help not only defeat this specific law but also to help the Latino community be more active in the political process," said Maria Elena Durazo, executive secretary-treasurer of the labor federation. "Hopefully it will motivate some to go out and register to vote."
That is what happened in 1994 after California voters passed Proposition 187, which sought to restrict services from illegal immigrants before being struck down by the courts. More than 1 million California Latinos became citizens, and voter registration spiked. Already, several groups in Arizona are registering voters and trying to increase Latino voter participation in an effort to shift the political landscape and stop any more anti-illegal immigrant laws from passing.
The caravan is just one of many activities planned for Thursday. Immigration activists have declared it a "national day of action," with events planned in several cities to protest implementation of the Arizona law. They include a march across the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, a vigil outside a detention center in Georgia and a unity event in Chicago featuring faith, community and political leaders, along with 200 children. Chicago leaders also plan to deliver 2,000 letters to Chicago Cubs owner Tom Ricketts, asking him to move the baseball team's spring training from Arizona to Florida.
The Obama administration filed a challenge to the law and argued in court last week that the federal government has the ultimate authority to implement immigration law and policy. The same day, immigrant rights groups argued that the law would lead to racial profiling and harassment of Latinos. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton did not say whether she would stop the law or when she would issue a ruling.
Meanwhile, Arizona is gearing up for Thursday, with officers receiving training and Phoenix officials planning for demonstrations. There also will be protests throughout California, including in Los Angeles, Bakersfield and Redlands.
Some who signed up for Thursday's bus caravan said they felt compelled to go to Arizona to show their opposition to the law and their support for immigrants.
"I look at things in a historical context," said Carlos Leon, 47, a detention officer with the L.A. County Probation Department who decided that he needed to speak up for the oppressed.
Leon said he believes the law is unjust and will result in people being questioned about their status based on their looks.
Even though his family has been in the United States for generations, Leon said he is still subjected to stereotyping. If the law goes into effect, he said he believes it will lead to more stereotyping and more fear among Latinos.
Rob Robbins, 71, a home care worker in Long Beach who is black, said he grew up in segregated Alabama in the 1940s and '50s and sees parallels between the racism of that time and now.
"Any time I see signs of that coming alive in our country, it raises my indignation," he said. "SB 1070 basically says you are guilty because of how you look. That, to me, is not American."
Robbins said having so many illegal immigrants in the U.S. is a problem, but Arizona's law isn't the solution.
"We have borders in this country for a purpose," he said. "That is where the problem is, and that is where the problem should be dealt with."

Full text: Arizona's damaging new immigration law is set to take effect Thursday. If that happens, police officers will be given broad new authority to apprehend illegal immigrants, Latinos will almost certainly find themselves subject to increased racial profiling, and the state will have resorted to a harsh and unfair policy to solve a problem that requires a nuanced and comprehensive approach. The federal government has sought an injunction to prevent the law from going into effect while its lawsuit against Arizona is heard. Although the legal bar for an injunction is high, the Justice Department's case against the law is sound and, regardless of the decision reached by District Judge Susan Bolton this week, the ultimate goal remains the same: overturning SB 1070.
One of the chief arguments against the Arizona law is that federal immigration policy is multifaceted: It takes a global view of immigration resources and determines how best to allocate them. The Obama administration, for example, has decided that the government should target illegal immigrants who commit crimes and employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. It also considers immigration in terms of foreign relations, including the relationship between the United States and Mexico, one of this country's largest trading partners. Under the new law, however, Arizona would interfere in such matters, commandeering federal resources to nab nannies and gardeners, a clear infringement on federal authority.
Arizona has one legitimate argument: that the federal government has failed to solve the immigration problem. That is true. Employers have hired illegal immigrants with impunity for generations. And even as it has ignored illegal immigration, the government has also made it increasingly difficult to immigrate legally from some countries. Even those who are approved for a visa to come to the United States can find themselves growing old waiting for it, and that interminable delay is a major inducement for illegal immigration.
Admittedly, Arizona is in a difficult position. There, Mexico's vicious drug war is not just a headline; it's a few miles away. Phoenix has more kidnappings than any other U.S. city, with most of the victims related to the drug war. On the other hand, Arizona already is under scrutiny for its treatment of immigrants. The Justice Department is investigating the Maricopa County sheriff's department over allegations of discriminatory police practices, unconstitutional searches and seizures, and allegations of "national origin discrimination."
The question isn't whether Arizona suffers negative consequences from illegal immigration. Of course it does. The entire nation does. But the solution is not a mishmash of angry laws adopted on a state-by-state basis. Washington must retain the authority to solve the problem, and then Washington must act.

Full text: As two "Boycott Target" groups sprang up on Facebook on Tuesday, the giant retailer defended its $150,000 donation to a group helping a Minnesota Republican gubernatorial candidate who opposes same-sex marriage.
Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel assured employees at the company's Minneapolis headquarters that the retailer's support of the gay community was "unwavering." He said employees, some gay, had raised concerns that the money was helping state Rep. Tom Emmer, a fiery conservative and the party's likely nominee for governor.
Target's money went to MN Forward, which is running TV ads supporting Emmer.
The contrast between Emmer's outspoken conservatism and Target's moderate image is striking. Emmer lauds Arizona's strict approach to illegal immigration and once advocated chemical castration for sex offenders. Target is known in Minnesota for donating to school programs, food pantries and the annual Twin Cities Pride gay festival.
Monica Meyer, interim head of the gay rights group OutFront Minnesota, said that the gay community had long viewed Target as a supportive employer, and that many are surprised by the donation. The group posted an open letter urging Target to take back its money.
"A lot of people feel betrayed," she said.
The two "Boycott Target" Facebook groups together had more than 3,000 followers by Tuesday evening. Some people posted business phone numbers for Target and Steinhafel, who individually also gave Emmer $2,000, the maximum under state law.
In an e-mail to employees, Steinhafel said Target's donations are intended to support business objectives such as job creation and economic growth.
He said the company doesn't have a social agenda or necessarily agree with all of the positions of candidates it supports. "Let me be very clear," he said, "Target's support of the GLBT [gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender] community is unwavering, and inclusiveness remains a core value of our company."
As of Tuesday, Target was the largest donor to MN Forward, which had raised more than $1 million from trade groups and companies including Best Buy Co., Pentair Inc., Hubbard Broadcasting Inc., Davisco Foods International Inc. and Polaris Industries Inc.
Best Buy spokeswoman Susan Busch said the company informed employees of its $100,000 donation early Tuesday and received only a few phone calls about it.
Target's headache illustrates the potential risks for businesses that seek to take advantage of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that threw out parts of a 63-year-old law that prohibited campaign donations from company funds. The ruling changed regulations in about half of the states, but the Target donation in Minnesota is among the first major new corporate moves to come to light.

Abstract: [...] a few hours into the cruise, after what began as an apparently routine stop by a marine patrol of local and federal law enforcement officials, two passengers -- a Guatemalan caterer hired for the day and Ms. Rich's boyfriend, David Quinn, an Irishman who had worked for years as a horse-carriage driver in Central Park -- were taken away on a police boat by federal immigration officials. In the past several years, for example, the Coast Guard division on Staten Island -- which patrols New York Harbor, the western half of Long Island Sound and the southern Hudson River -- has stepped up its scrutiny of smaller foreign-flagged vessels, said Charles Rowe, a spokesman for the Coast Guard in New York City.

Full text: Gaea Rich and her family were in full holiday mode aboard their yacht on the Fourth of July as they motored from Stamford, Conn., across Long Island Sound and into Oyster Bay, off the North Shore of Long Island.
The trip, with more than 15 relatives and friends, was supposed to be the high point of a weekend family reunion. But a few hours into the cruise, after what began as an apparently routine stop by a marine patrol of local and federal law enforcement officials, two passengers -- a Guatemalan caterer hired for the day and Ms. Rich's boyfriend, David Quinn, an Irishman who had worked for years as a horse-carriage driver in Central Park -- were taken away on a police boat by federal immigration officials. Both men were illegal immigrants; they now face deportation.
The yacht had been caught in a web of laws, little known outside the maritime community, that are meant to keep a tight leash on vessels that are registered in foreign countries or have traveled in international waters. And the boarding and interrogations on a pleasure craft came as quite a surprise to passengers.
"We couldn't believe it," recalled Ms. Rich, 28, a fashion designer for Ralph Lauren. "Everyone was just shocked."
The boat is registered in the Caribbean nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and owned by Ms. Rich's uncle. He keeps the boat moored mostly in American waters: Stamford in the summer and Florida in the winter.
Many American yacht owners register their boats in foreign countries, often for tax purposes. That was her uncle's reason, said Ms. Rich, adding that her uncle did not want to be interviewed or identified.
Federal maritime law requires that foreign-flagged vessels contact customs officials when they arrive at American ports, even if arriving from another American port. Immigration officials are permitted to board foreign-flagged vessels anytime, said Officer John F. Saleh, a spokesman for United States Customs and Border Protection. Coast Guard officials, who joined in the stop, are allowed to board any vessel at any time in American waters.
Maritime laws and their enforcement have tightened since 9/11. In the past several years, for example, the Coast Guard division on Staten Island -- which patrols New York Harbor, the western half of Long Island Sound and the southern Hudson River -- has stepped up its scrutiny of smaller foreign-flagged vessels, said Charles Rowe, a spokesman for the Coast Guard in New York City.
Mr. Rowe said that under the program, "Operation Small Fry," Coast Guard officials, along with federal and local law enforcement personnel, have boarded about 750 such boats a year, to enforce customs, immigration and maritime laws.
Several marina managers in the New York area said they had heard complaints from exasperated owners and operators of foreign-flagged yachts about repeated boardings and laborious permit regulations.
It is frustrating for those with foreign flags, said the manager of a luxury marina in the Hamptons, who insisted on anonymity to avoid offending any of his clients. But, he added, "They really can't complain because the reason they're foreign-flagged is to avoid paying taxes."
The owners and operators of the largest yachts are well acquainted with the rules and their enforcement, maritime experts said. "These guys are prepared for this stuff," said Lucy Reed, editor of The Triton, a monthly magazine read largely by the captains and crews of private yachts. "They know what they need to have, for the most part, to cruise in U.S. waters."
It was unclear whether Ms. Rich's uncle had been aware of the rules.
The July 4 incident began about 1:30 p.m. when a boat operated by the Nassau County Police Department pulled alongside the 63-foot yacht as it entered Oyster Bay. On the police vessel were customs and Coast Guard officers, Officer Saleh said; he did not provide more details about the stop. The Nassau police said they were assisting Customs and Border Protection and referred all inquiries to that agency.
Ms. Rich said the officers seemed unfamiliar with the St. Vincent flag, "and wanted to see my uncle's cruising license." Immigration officials took one catering worker, a Hispanic woman, to a room below deck and interviewed her for about half an half before determining that she was in the United States legally, Ms. Rich said.
The officers then asked all the other passengers -- some of them foreign citizens with green cards or work visas -- for government-issued identification. When Mr. Quinn and the catering worker were unable to produce proof that they were in the country legally, the officers took them below deck, Ms. Rich said.
Mr. Quinn "came up after 20 to 30 minutes and he said, 'I guess I'm going home,' " she recalled. "And I said, 'You're joking, right?' " Mr. Quinn's expected deportation, Ms. Rich said, has severely complicated their budding relationship. The romance began in late March when Ms. Rich spotted Mr. Quinn, 30, tending his horse and carriage on Central Park South, near her office. She returned a few days later with a friend, and rented his carriage for a spin around the park.
"We were the last ride of the day, and invited him to come up to a bar after he'd finished stabling his horse," she recalled. "It was a romantic night."
Ms. Rich said she soon learned about Mr. Quinn's immigration status. He had arrived in the United States in 2003, joining several siblings who had become American citizens, and overstayed his tourist visa.
Mr. Quinn's brothers asked the Rev. Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest and an immigrant advocate, to help with the case. Father Jordan said he was indignant that the two men had been detained, considering recent directives by Immigration and Customs Enforcement giving priority to the apprehension of criminals.
"This is New York State," Father Jordan said, "This is not Arizona."
Federal immigration officials would not comment on the case. On Thursday, after requests by his lawyer, Zachary Sanders, and lobbying of the Department of Homeland Security by Father Jordan, Mr. Quinn was released for 45 days to prepare for deportation to Ireland.
Mr. Quinn said in an interview on Monday that he was hoping to find a way to remain in the United States. If unsuccessful, he said, he would accept the deportation and try to return legally. "I'm doing the best that I can," he said.
He said that he was held in the same detention center, in Elizabeth, N.J., as the catering worker, but that the worker was not granted a similar temporary reprieve. (Neither Mr. Quinn nor Ms. Rich knew the worker's name.)
Mr. Quinn said that he had not considered trying to legalize his status through marriage, as some immigrants do.
"I was waiting for the right woman," he said. "And this is what happened to me: a bit of bad luck. And I thought the Irish had the good luck."

Shortly thereafter, he helped establish the Nassau Stores, a chain of five and ten cent stores on Long Island which closed in the 1980s. Frank then worked for 23 years at the Manhasset (New York) Public Library, where he became the oldest paid library employee in the country prior to his retirement in 2009. He loved music, books, language and his family. He owed much in a long wonderful life to the Unitarian Universalist Congregation, to the Manhasset Public Library, and to many community organizations in Port Washington. He is survived by sons Leo and Henry, six grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.

From Israel, mixed signals on peace effort; Chief envoy stands firm on settlements amid talk of bold gestures

Abstract: While Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak visited Washington this week to talk about peace gestures toward the Palestinians, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman was planting a tree in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank -- an indication of permanence that few Palestinians would welcome. President Obama's Middle East envoy, George J. Mitchell, has been laboring for months to move Israelis and Palestinians into direct talks on the core issues that divide them, including the future of Jewish settlements built on land Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.

Full text: While Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak visited Washington this week to talk about peace gestures toward the Palestinians, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman was planting a tree in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank -- an indication of permanence that few Palestinians would welcome.
The contrast showed the confusion U.S. officials face in figuring out how willing Israel might be to cede territory as part of a two-state solution to the conflict.
President Obama's Middle East envoy, George J. Mitchell, has been laboring for months to move Israelis and Palestinians into direct talks on the core issues that divide them, including the future of Jewish settlements built on land Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.
The peace effort faces a major challenge on Sept. 26, when a 10-month freeze of Israeli settlement construction is set to expire. The United States and Israel for years have quarreled over Israeli construction in the occupied West Bank that is widely considered illegal under international law. The United States, which says settlement construction undermines peace talks, pushed hard for the moratorium on building.
Lieberman, who wields immense power as the head of the second-largest party in Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's coalition, reassured settlers Monday that life would return to normal when the freeze ends.
"When we took the decision on the settlement freeze, we said explicitly that it was only for 10 months and that afterward life would return to the way it was," Lieberman said during a visit to the Bruchin settlement. "We think people here, who were sent here by previous Israeli governments to live, have a right to live normal lives."
That Israel's chief diplomat was touring the West Bank, rather than traveling to Washington, was not totally surprising: Lieberman lives in a settlement. And the politician's domestic initiatives in recent months have garnered more attention than his diplomacy.
His Yisrael Beitenu ("Israel Is Our Home") party has sponsored legislation that would strip citizenship from Arab Israelis deemed disloyal to the state. He has tangled with Netanyahu over budget matters in a rift that became front-page news. And his party has sponsored a bill to change rules related to Jewish conversion that angered American Jews from the liberal Reform and Conservative movements.
Amid all of this, Netanyahu seems to be trying to minimize Lieberman's exposure abroad. Following Israel's raid on an aid ship bound for the blockaded Gaza Strip that left nine Turkish activists dead, Netanyahu sent his industry and trade minister to see Turkey's foreign minister in a secret rapprochement bid. Netanyahu himself met Tuesday with Jordan's King Abdullah II to discuss prospects for peace talks.
Barak has become the de facto envoy for Israel's important relationship with the United States, having visited Washington seven times in the past year. Lieberman has visited once.
None of that makes Lieberman, however, any less important when it comes to Israeli politics. The 52-year-old, born in the former Soviet republic of Moldova, has emerged as a forceful leader of the Israeli right, and one of the most skeptical voices on peace with the Palestinians.
On Monday, Lieberman traveled from Bruchin to Barkan, an Israeli industrial zone in the West Bank. Lieberman walked past vats of soaking chickpeas and posed for a photo with Palestinian workers packaging hummus.
Barkan industrialists have complained about the toll a Palestinian boycott of settlement goods has taken on their business. Lieberman pledged to seek ways to compensate factory owners for their losses.
The Palestinian Authority says the boycott is an effective way to draw attention to Israel's settlements. Israel sees it as a sign of the Palestinians' unwillingness to make peace.
"Anyone, who wants to see a good example of coexistence, ought to come here," Lieberman said, noting that half of the industrial park's 6,000 workers are Palestinians.
Later, Lieberman told a settlement leader he would bring mobile homes to Barkan to house new Russian immigrants. By contrast, that same day, the Israeli army removed an illegal mobile home at a settlement outpost.
From the bulletproof window of his bus, Lieberman could see Palestinian olive trees burning on a hillside that settler youths had torched in response to the army action.
Soon after, standing atop Mount Gerizim, Lieberman peered down at a Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of Nablus, today a major Palestinian population center. A tour guide read to Lieberman from biblical passages asserting Jewish claims to the area.
Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon, a former ambassador to the United States who is now a member of Lieberman's party, listened nearby. He said he saw no conflict between Lieberman's settlement solidarity tour and Barak's message that Israel is ready to make bold peace gestures.
"It's not a contradiction at all," Ayalon said, noting that the settlement dispute will be resolved only as part of direct peace talks. "On the contrary, it's just one aspect that shows the complexity of the issue."

Full text: After eight U.S. presidents, 19 Supreme Court justices and 41 Nobel laureates, it looks like Harvard University can chalk up a different achievement this summer: its first grad in the NBA in 57 years, and just the fourth ever.
Jeremy Lin, who signed July 21 with his hometown Golden State Warriors, also will be the first Asian American in the league since 1947, when Wat Misaka, a Japanese American, became the first non-white player in what was then known as the Basketball Association of America.
"Trying to make the NBA is one of the very few areas where a Harvard degree won't necessarily help," Lin said matter-of-factly.
Lin is aware of the significance of both accomplishments, but doesn't want the labels. He was usually the only Asian on the court when he captained Palo Alto High to a California state championship in 2006 and during four years at Harvard, where last season he was part of the 0.5 percent of Asian American Division I men's basketball players.
Lin just wants to be known as a basketball player.
"I'm aware of all that but I'm just going to be focused on playing basketball," said the 6-foot-3 Lin, a devout Christian who was born in California after his parents immigrated from Taiwan. "I'm a basketball player. Everyone wants to focus on me being Asian American but me being a basketball player, me being Christian, is more important to me than just being simply Asian American."
According to basketball-reference.com, only 40 Ivy Leaguers have played in an NBA or ABA game. Lin would become the first Harvard grad to play since the 1953-54 season, when Ed Smith appeared in 11 games with the New York Knicks.
In his brief time on the Dallas Mavericks summer league team earlier this month the topic was unavoidable.
"That was my name, they just called me 'Harvard,' " said Lin, who graduated with a degree in economics. "Anytime I messed up it was, 'Aw, I thought you went to Harvard.' "
Going into June's draft, Lin was considered a borderline pick. He had worked out for eight teams, including the Warriors, and received some positive feedback. But he didn't have any expectations when he watched the draft at home with his family, high school coach and pastor.
He went undrafted and was invited to play on the Mavericks summer league team, where he impressed in five games off the bench. He averaged 9.8 points and 3.2 rebounds in 18.6 minutes per game. Against John Wall and the Wizards he scored 13 points and won over the crowd.
"I gained a lot of confidence," said Lin. "I think I got to show my game and how I play in a five-on-five setting and not in a one-on-one or three-on-three setting like the workouts were."
In those five games he convinced clubs that he can compete with the talent that generally is not found in the slower-paced and less athletic Ivy League.
"He understands the overall game," said Warriors General Manager Larry Riley. " . . . He handles the ball well. He's one of those guys that has a chance to keep getting better in other phases of the game."
After the summer league, a number of teams showed interest. Lin said his agent, Roger Montgomery, presented him with the three best offers. Lin said he chose the Warriors over the Mavericks and Lakers because of location, style of play, his chances of making the team and the terms of the contract.
He reportedly signed a deal that guarantees him half his rookie salary, estimated at $500,000 -- a pact uncommon for an undrafted free agent. The contract has a team option for a second year and Riley said "we're looking at him to be with us beyond one year."
Golden State recently traded point guard C.J. Watson and needed a back up for Stephen Curry. Lin may be the answer. But like most rookies, he needs to improve in several areas, including his strength, defense and, most importantly, his outside shooting, Riley said.
The guaranteed money and Watson's trade are strong indications of Lin's chances of making the team and battling for minutes behind Curry.
"I'm a lifelong Warriors fan," said Lin, who is projected to move to point guard after playing shooting guard at Harvard. "In hindsight, not getting drafted was a blessing in disguise from God."
Lin has had to prove himself since high school. Named state player of the year by several publications, he did not receive a single Division 1 scholarship offer. UCLA, Stanford and Cal recruited him as a walk-on, but Harvard and Brown -- which, like all Ivies, do not award scholarships -- showed the most interest.
"It's hard to speak for the people who recruited me," Lin said. "In their defense, there were a lot of different risks for people to recruit me. I wasn't the biggest or most explosive. They just didn't know how my game would transfer for the college level. But I was disappointed and thought I had been overlooked."
He chose Harvard, where former Seton Hall and Michigan head coach Tommy Amaker was hired after Lin's freshman season. Under Amaker, Lin blossomed into a unanimous all-Ivy League first-team selection his junior and senior seasons. He briefly received national recognition during wins over Boston College and a 30-point, nine-rebound showing against then-No. 12 U-Conn. last season.
He endured frequent slurs during road games, including, a teammate told Time magazine, when a fan yelled "sweet-and-sour pork" during Harvard's loss at Georgetown last December.
But the Warriors see Lin's ethnicity as a marketing advantage in the Bay Area. The club is creating a campaign around him.
"If he didn't have the skill set to go with it, that's not something you want to get into," Riley said. "I felt it was most important that he'd be a basketball player first."
That's what Jeremy Lin wants too.

Webb's affirmative action confusion

Abstract: Webb's essay may ease the concerns of conservatives in a state where he barely won his seat in 2006 against incumbent Republican George Allen, but Webb runs the risk of dividing crucial black voters for whom affirmative action is as much of a do-not-touch issue as Social Security is to seniors.

Full text: At a time when racial dialogue amounts to charges and countercharges between the tea party movement and the NAACP over who's the bigger racist, you have to give Sen. James Webb credit. The Virginia Democrat is taking a principled position, which means it is a position that could turn his own core voters against him.
In a Wall Street Journal op-ed last week, Webb called for an end to government diversity programs. That's huge. For a Democrat like Webb, whose base is heavily black, criticizing affirmative action is about as dangerous politically as attacking Social Security at a convention of retired seniors. Yet, Webb, whose discontent with diversity programs came up as an issue in his 2006 campaign, has a thoughtful nuance in his views.
He defends affirmative action as it was outlined by President Lyndon Johnson, based on the 13th Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which authorized the federal government to take actions in order to eliminate "the badges of slavery." This policy was "justifiable and understandable," Webb writes, "even to those who came from white cultural groups that had also suffered in socio-economic terms from the Civil War and its aftermath."
But Webb objects to the expansion of that rationale to include "all 'people of color,'" especially after new immigration laws in 1965 dramatically changed the demographic makeup of the U.S. and "moved affirmative action away from remediation and toward discrimination, this time against whites."
Yet, before Webb slips too deeply into the white-conservative grievances familiar to the political right, he argues that the expansion to all non-whites "also lessened the focus on assisting African-Americans, who despite a veneer of successful people at the very top still experience high rates of poverty, drug abuse, incarceration and family breakup."
Despite that rose tossed to African-Americans, his essay has been strongly criticized by such prominent black Virginians as former Gov. Douglas Wilder and the state's NAACP chapter. Webb's essay may ease the concerns of conservatives in a state where he barely won his seat in 2006 against incumbent Republican George Allen, but Webb runs the risk of dividing crucial black voters for whom affirmative action is as much of a do-not-touch issue as Social Security is to seniors.
It is hard for any fair-minded American to disagree with Webb's message that government attention should be paid to people's needs more than their race. And he is correct to say that "white America is not a monolith," even if it was treated as one by laws that awarded the white race a privileged status.
But it is hard to figure out what he means by asserting "many hard-working white Americans" have somehow been forgotten or left behind.
The essay's headline, "Diversity and the myth of white privilege," is eye-catching, but unsupported by the actual essay in which the word "myth" does not appear again. Webb does write that "WASP elites have fallen by the wayside," although it is not clear what he means by "elites" or "wayside."
He also asserts that a "plethora of government-enforced diversity policies have marginalized many white workers," yet he does not say who was pushed to the margins or how.
And, as much as Webb cites President Franklin Roosevelt's study of Southern white poverty for examples of how "such deficiencies do not disappear overnight and they affect the momentum of a culture," the same is true of deficiencies left behind by bias against blacks in Roosevelt's New Deal program, as recounted by Ira Katznelson in his book, "When Affirmative Action Was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America."
Even as hundreds of thousands of blacks migrated out of the Jim Crow South, Social Security, federal home loans, protective labor laws, the GI Bill and other progressive policies adopted by the Roosevelt and Truman administrations excluded most African-Americans or treated them as second-class citizens because of their race.
Webb shows courage by just going near this volatile topic, even if the result sounds at times like "affirmative confusion." I support efforts to diversify the colleges and the workforce but, like Webb and President Barack Obama, among others, I am disappointed that they increasingly seem to pass over the truly disadvantaged of all colors who need help the most. Our colleges and workplaces could benefit from diversity by social and economic class, too, and not just by race.

Full text: Arizona's new anti-immigration law, which goes into effect on July 29, has been a rallying point for many conservatives. It reinvigorated the lackluster administration of Arizona's Republican governor, Jan Brewer, and has earned enthusiastic support from tea party activists in Arizona and elsewhere. But many aspects of the law should give conservatives cause for alarm.
The problems begin in Section 2 of the law, which grants all legal residents the power to sue any state agency or official that they believe is failing to enforce immigration laws. This provision will funnel millions of dollars to trial lawyers and put Arizona police officers in a no-win situation.
As 19-year Phoenix Police Department veteran David Salgado has said, enforcing the law could get him sued by the federal government for violating civil-rights protections, while failing to enforce the law could get him sued by anti-immigration activists. Two county sheriffs in Arizona have already created funds to cover their departments against the lawsuits that will inevitably come, undermining law enforcement and enriching trial lawyers along the way.
Worse, deputizing all of Arizona's police officers as federal immigration agents will make their jobs more difficult and dangerous. This is because unauthorized immigrants would be all the more reluctant to report crimes or work with police as witnesses. As William Bratton, the former police chief in Los Angeles and Boston, has said, officers "can't prevent or solve crimes if victims or witnesses are unwilling to talk to us for fear of being deported."
Business owners also have much to fear from Arizona's law. Sections 7 and 8 reaffirm the 2007 Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA), which mandated that all businesses in the state use the faulty E-Verify system that, according to a 2010 audit from Westat, fails to identify undocumented workers 54% of the time. LAWA also mandated stiff sanctions against employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers. (The U.S. Chamber of Commerce will soon challenge the constitutionality of LAWA before the Supreme Court on the grounds that it pre-empts the federal government's immigration power.)
Building on LAWA, Arizona's new law enacts a two-strike policy under which second-time business offenders lose their business licenses. Thus a law championed by conservatives makes it harder for businesses to do what they are supposed to: lower costs and pass savings on to consumers.
Immigrant scientists, entrepreneurs and laborers bring innovation, dedication and good old-fashioned hard work to bear on improving their own lives and the lives of others around them. Removing restrictions on the movement of labor -- which primarily serve to protect labor unions and assuage nativists -- would be an enormous boon to the national economy.
Arizona's law is popular partly because Arizonans fear an illegal immigrant crime wave. But crime rates in Arizona are at historic lows. According to the state Bureau of Justice, violent crime rates in 2008 (the latest year for which data are available) were lower than any point since 1976. Property crime rates have declined even more steeply, with 2008 figures lower than at any point since 1966. It is a myth, then, that illegal immigrants bring a wave of crime in their wake.
Arizona's new enforcement measures won't solve the problems of unauthorized immigration and the black market in labor. Solutions will come only from expanding legal immigration -- by removing barriers to the movement of people across borders (except those for keeping out criminals, potential terrorists, and people with infectious diseases).
Without expanded legal immigration, laws like Arizona's will continue to have troubling and unforeseen effects on police officers, businesses and others.

Full text: Arizona authorities battling the Obama administration over the state's new immigration law may face an unforeseen obstacle in enforcing the measure: While local police can arrest illegal immigrants, only the federal government can deport them.
Because the federal immigration-enforcement agency has suggested it won't necessarily cooperate in helping meet the law's goal, local police could be forced to choose between holding detainees in their own jails or releasing them.
The Arizona law, which takes effect Thursday, makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and requires police who stop people for such routine infractions as speeding to check their immigration status if there is "reasonable suspicion" they are here unlawfully. The police can detain them while clarifying their status, but deportation can only be conducted by federal authorities.
Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security -- which houses U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- said Tuesday the priorities for federal enforcement apply to recent border crossers, felony re-entry cases and serious criminals who pose a public-safety risk.
Police in Arizona and across the U.S. currently have the capability to contact ICE to verify the immigration status of people they stop. The agency then confirms whether a person is deportable. If the person doesn't fall into a priority category, they might be issued a notice to appear before an immigration judge but wouldn't be detained by the federal government. That means the person could remain in the U.S. for months or years while fighting their removal.
Arizona is home to about 460,000 illegal immigrants, according to the DHS. If the new law goes into effect -- a challenge by the Obama administration is pending before a judge -- police could shower ICE with calls. Without its cooperation, police likely would have to release suspects, because the law doesn't give them the authority to detain an individual indefinitely based on suspicion of unlawful presence in the U.S.
To achieve the law's stated goal of attrition through enforcement, "ICE needs to play with us," said John Harris, president of the Arizona Association of Police Chiefs. "Without ICE, it makes it much more difficult for us to arrest people."
Asked about its plans regarding Arizona's new law, the agency said that "ICE is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that focuses first on criminal aliens who pose a threat to our communities." It added that the outcome of the Justice Department's challenge to the law -- on grounds that immigration enforcement is the purview of the federal government -- "will inform the government's actions going forward."
ICE now works with local law enforcement in Arizona and other states. For example, illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes normally are turned over to the agency after completing sentences for state crimes. The agency also has agreements with more than 70 localities that empower about 1,200 personnel, who have received special training, to verify the status of immigrants.
Arizona's law would require the state's 15,000 local law-enforcement officers to check the status of those they suspect are in the U.S. illegally.
Juan Pedrosa, an immigration-policy researcher at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, said ICE's response would be crucial because it is being closely watched by other state lawmakers seeking to promote the arrest and deportation of large numbers of illegal immigrants.
About 11 million illegal immigrants are believed to live in the U.S. In a June 30 memo to ICE employees, agency chief John Morton said it had the capability to remove "less than 4% of the estimated illegal alien population in the United States."
A record 387,790 people were deported from the U.S. in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. ICE removed 81,429 in Arizona, including 23,550 criminals. Mr. Morton has said he opposes Arizona's law because it isn't the role of states to draft their own responses to illegal immigration.
In a declaration with the federal lawsuit, David Palmatier, head of ICE's Law Enforcement Support Center, said an increase in queries from Arizona "will delay response times. . .and risks exceeding the capacity of the center to respond to higher priority requests for criminal alien status determination."

Full text: New York police are stepping up their presence in the Staten Island neighborhood of Port Richmond amid an escalation of bias crimes against the Latino population.
On Tuesday, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said that additional uniformed and plainclothes officers will be deployed in the neighborhood.
"I'm concerned about the recent spike in bias crimes on Staten Island, and the threat it poses to individuals of Mexican descent in particular. We're devoting additional resources, beginning tonight, to address it." Mr. Kelly said.
About 20 patrol cars with two officers each will flood the area, chief police spokesman Paul Browne said. They will set up a mobile command center and two temporary observation towers in Port Richmond, where most of the attacks have been concentrated, he said.
Ten incidents in the area since April 5 are being investigated as hate crimes, including three reported within the past few days. The cases include victims who were beaten with baseball bats, some to the point of unconsciousness.
The city's Mexican Consulate, meanwhile, said it is dispatching personnel and a roving car to the neighborhood and that it was providing legal and social services to victims.
"We will act decisively in order to protect our citizens and will actively promote that those guilty of these vicious attacks are brought to justice expeditiously," Ruben Beltran, Mexico's consul general in New York, said in a statement. "We are working hand-in-hand with local authorities on all levels," he said.
Nine of the attacks occurred in Port Richmond; the most recent, on Saturday, took place several miles away in Manor Heights.
The three recent attacks are being investigated by the police department's hate-crimes task force, but haven't been officially classified as bias crimes. Police have made arrests in three of the 10 cases.
The U.S. Justice Department's civil-rights division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District are monitoring the cases.
Mr. Kelly met with Mr. Beltran on Tuesday and asked him to spread the word that the NYPD isn't an immigration agency and that witnesses and victims of hate crimes shouldn't be deterred from coming forward regardless of their immigration status, Mr. Browne said. He said the NYPD will use an overtime pool that is used to fight jumps in crime levels to pay for the increased staffing.

LONDON--U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said his coalition government would push ahead with its plan to cap non-European Union immigration but said the government would consult as widely as possible to prevent the policy hurting Britain's economy.
Mr. Cameron said he wants to see immigration reduced to tens of thousands a year--the average levels seen in the 1990s. "First of all, I think we need to control immigration more effectively in Britain. Yes, I do want a cap," he told the British Broadcasting Corp. during a visit to India.
But Mr. Cameron said, "we're consulting as widely as possible about our immigration arrangements but let me be absolutely clear I want to see--and the government wants to see--the level of net immigration into the U.K. come down to the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands it has been in recent years."
Mr. Cameron, who is in India trying to promote trade and other ties, has faced criticism from Indian officials over his new government's plans to tighten immigration rules.
Mr. Cameron said his government would welcome the views of Indian businesses and officials as part of the consultation on the immigration cap plans. He hasn't yet said what the immigration cap will be.
It has also proved controversial within Mr. Cameron's coalition, with the junior Liberal Democrats opposing an immigration cap before the May election.
Business Secretary Vince Cable, who is from the Liberal Democrats, told the BBC the U.K.'s immigration policy needs to be as "flexible" as possible. "The key point is it has got to be flexible and it has got to reflect the fact that Britain is open for business and trying to attract inward investment," Mr. Cable said. "We are in a globalized world and companies expect to be able to move their staff around simply to do their job."
Mr. Cameron, who is also facing trouble from his Conservative party lawmakers over a Liberal Democrat-supported referendum on changing the voting system, said coalition "does involve compromise."
He said he was "very confident" the referendum would go ahead as planned, despite more than 40 Conservative lawmakers opposing holding the referendum as planned next May. In the interview, Mr. Cameron also defended himself from charges of talking Britain down.
Mr. Cameron's message on his trip has been that the U.K. needs to work hard in a changing world to ensure its economic future after a deep recession. This comes after Cameron talked during a trip to Washington earlier this month about the U.K. being the junior partner to the U.S. since 1940, the year before the U.S. entered World War II.
"I'm not in any way talking Britain down," Mr. Cameron said. "I am fiercely patriotic about Britain. I think we have a huge role to play in the world." "But at the same time, if you want to win strong relationships with countries like India and China, you've got to talk about the future. And taking a realistic view of our position and place in the world ... I think is a very sensible thing," he said.

Yesterday, after months of heated rhetoric and debate about Arizona's controversial new immigration law, federal Judge Susan Bolton blocked most of SB 1070 from taking effect. The move served as an important affirmation of the federal government's responsibility in enforcing our nation's immigration laws. But regardless of what happened with this case, this administration will continue to enforce the law, just as we have been doing for the past 18 months: with unprecedented resources and a clear commitment to serious, smart and effective enforcement that has yielded important results.
We are career prosecutors who lead the two main border and immigration enforcement agencies in the United States--U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). We know the paramount importance of enforcing the law and we understand the federal government's responsibilities. And what we have seen on the border, at workplaces, and in communities across America in the past 18 months represents the most serious approach to enforcement we have witnessed in our careers.
At the border we have concentrated unprecedented amounts of manpower, infrastructure and technology. Today, the Border Patrol is better staffed than at any time in its history--nearly doubling in personnel since 2004 to more than 20,000 today. ICE has a quarter of all its personnel in the Southwest border region, also the most ever. There is more fencing and other infrastructure than ever before. And more technology, improving the ability to detect illegal movements at all times of day and night.
We have engaged in high levels of cooperation with Mexico to crack down on smuggling. And we have provided more funding than ever before to local law enforcement in border communities to deal with border-related crime.
As a result, the numbers are clearly moving in the right direction: Last year, illegal crossings along the Southwest border were down 23%, to a fraction of their all-time high. Seizures of contraband rose significantly across the board in 2009--illegal bulk cash, illegal weapons and illegal drugs. By all measurable standards, crime in U.S. border towns has remained flat for most of the last decade.
At the same time, this administration knows that more can be done. That is why the president authorized the deployment of up to 1,200 National Guard troops to support federal law enforcement on the border. He has also asked Congress for $600 million in supplemental funding, which reflects the administration's understanding that the assets we have must be a permanent part of a long-term, systematic effort to deny, disrupt and defeat the activities of transnational criminal organizations that smuggle illicit drugs, people, weapons and bulk cash across our border with Mexico.
Throughout the country, we have made enforcement of immigration laws smarter and more effective. We have made cracking down on drug cartels and deporting convicted criminal aliens who threaten public safety a priority. And we have achieved results.
Programs like Secure Communities, which identifies illegal immigrants already in state and local jails who have committed crimes have been expanded. Last year, we deported a record number of felons who were in the country illegally.
ICE investigates and prosecutes employers who have a history of knowingly employing an illegal work force. Instead of focusing on high-profile worksite enforcement actions, or "raids," this administration has already audited more companies to check their compliance with federal law than the last administration did during its entire time in office. To help employers comply with the law, the administration continues to improve and expand the E-Verify program, a web-based system that allows employers to verify the employment eligibility of new hires.
In all, more is being done--and more results are being achieved--to secure the border and enforce the law than ever before. This is important work that we will continue--throughout the nation and in Arizona--as we remain committed to actively working with members of Congress from both parties to make necessary reforms to our immigration laws.
Meanwhile, this administration remains committed to enforcing the laws we have in the smartest and most effective way possible. The progress we've already made shows why it's so critical to continue pushing forward.

Ruling Is New Hot-Button Issue in Hot Season

Publication info: Wall Street Journal (Online) ; New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]28 July 2010: n/a.

Abstract: Jonathan Weisman; Stephanie Simon Jane Norton, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Colorado, had a hunch that by dinnertime Wednesday, conservative voters across the state would have heard about a federal judge blocking much of Arizona's immigration law.

Jane Norton, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Colorado, had a hunch that by dinnertime Wednesday, conservative voters across the state would have heard about a federal judge blocking much of Arizona's immigration law.
She had a hunch they would be angry.
So Ms. Norton's campaign ordered up a new round of robocalls, informing voters that Ms. Norton was proud to have been endorsed by one of the immigration law's strongest advocates, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. The campaign had already called 80,000 Republican voters. Now, it planned to call 100,000 more, said Josh Penry, Ms. Norton's campaign manager.
The calls to Colorado voters Wednesday night were just one sign that the federal ruling in Arizona is likely to ripple through this heated campaign season.
Republicans quickly denounced both the ruling and the Obama Justice Department for challenging the law in the first place. Some said the ruling would further energize voters who are angry about what they see as federal overreach on health care and other issues.
Rep. John Boozman, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Arkansas, said he expected the judge's ruling to further rile voters and motivate them to reject Democratic incumbents. "It's a defining issue," Mr. Boozman said. Mr. Boozman takes questions at every town hall, he said, and "this will come up at every one."
Democrats, divided on the issue and running against stiff political headwinds, were unsure how the ruling would play out.
Some called it an unhelpful distraction from the campaigns they have been building around jobs, economic themes and border enforcement. Pat Waak, chairwoman of the Colorado Democratic Party, said candidates can't win in the fall if they aren't talking about jobs and the economy.
"We're not talking about credit-card companies not being able to take advantage of you, or student loans," she said. "We have to be the messengers of what affects your life."
Other Democrats said U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton had usefully inserted herself between the two political lightning rods--the Arizona law and the Obama administration.
Rep. Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.), who had encouraged the Justice Department suit, said Democrats can now say that however one feels about the Arizona law, major elements of it have been put into question by a judge. "This helps Democrats talk about solutions," he said in an interview.
The judge's ruling doesn't order Congress to act, and lawmakers have shown little interest this year in tackling the issue. But if immigrant-rights advocates and anti-illegal immigration activists agree the current system is broken, they appear to have no choice but to press for congressional action.
"I'm hoping that this has turbocharged that understanding and sent it from Arizona straight to Capitol Hill, where we really need to be having this discussion," said Angela Kelley of the Center for American Progress, a group with close ties to the White House. She is an advocate for an immigration overhaul that includes a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. "At some point, you've got to eat your vegetables," she said.
But for Democrats, the turbocharge might be at the polls, and to their disadvantage. William Gheen, president of the anti-illegal immigrant Americans for Legal Immigration, called Wednesday for all congressional incumbents to be ousted in November.
"There's a wave of anger sweeping across this nation today as people of all races and political affiliations feel that we the people have been betrayed by this president and this judge," he said.
Former U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo, an anti-illegal immigration firebrand who is running for Colorado governor on a third-party ticket, predicted the ruling would motivate conservatives, tea-party activists and all voters who "are so sick of the federal government."
"This action will stoke the fires of states' rights throughout this country, and well it should," Mr. Tancredo said.
In Arizona, Democratic House members in swing districts--Reps. Harry Mitchell, Ann Kirkpatrick and Gabrielle Giffords--had denounced the Justice Department's effort to block the state law. Ms. Kirkpatrick said Wednesday that the ruling wouldn't end the legal fight.
"Elected officials would be wise to stop talking about distractions and focus on their constituents," Ms. Kirkpatrick said, vowing to press for federal action on a border-security law this fall.
Obama administration officials said the ruling should force Republicans who sided with a bipartisan effort on immigration in 2006 and 2007 to come back to the table.
And administration officials said they believe that after the midterm elections, the debate will shift. In their view, an energized Republican base might drive the results this November. But the 2012 presidential election, which will draw a far larger number of voters to the polls, will likely turn on swing voters, including Latinos in key states such as Colorado and Nevada, administration officials said.
"I find it incomprehensible that Republicans are almost unanimously negative on this decision," New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said. "It's just alienating Hispanic voters....If Republicans continue to block efforts for comprehensive reform, they're going to suffer at the polls. "

PHOENIX--A federal judge Wednesday temporarily blocked key parts of Arizona's new immigration law on the eve of implementation, saying it was unlikely the state would prevail in legal challenges to such provisions as requiring police to question and detain suspected illegal immigrants following routine stops.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton granted the Obama administration's request for a preliminary injunction on the grounds that immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government, not states. Arizona said it would appeal the decision in what could be a protracted legal battle with Washington.
Since Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed the legislation on April 23, the new law has sparked a national debate over illegal immigration and become a central issue in midterm elections across the U.S. Inspired by Arizona, legislators and candidates in states stretching from Florida to Colorado have said they would draft similar laws to tackle illegal immigration. All told, about two dozen states are considering such laws.
"This fight is far from over. In fact, it is just the beginning," Gov. Brewer said. Arizona will file an expedited appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, she said, and "battle all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary, for the right to protect the citizens of Arizona."
Matthew Chandler, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration, said, the court's decision "correctly affirms the federal government's responsibilities in enforcing our nation's immigration laws."
He said the Obama administration had dedicated "unprecedented resources" to secure the border, and would continue to focus resources on "criminal aliens who pose a public safety threat and employers who knowingly hire illegal labor."
In her 36-page court order, Judge Bolton blocked several provisions of the new law, which was to take effect Thursday. Most notably, she blocked a requirement that police check the immigration status of people stopped for such routine infractions as traffic violations, if police suspect they are in the U.S. illegally. She also blocked a section that required law enforcement to detain individuals until their legal status was clarified.
"There is a substantial likelihood that officers will wrongfully arrest legal resident aliens under the new [law],'' Judge Bolton wrote. "By enforcing this statute, Arizona would impose a 'distinct, unusual and extraordinary' burden on legal resident aliens that only the federal government has the authority to impose."
She also blocked a section that required foreigners to carry documents proving they had permission to be in the U.S., and another provision that banned illegal immigrants from seeking work in Arizona.
The judge said the sections of the law, known as SB1070, should not go into effect until the court addresses issues surrounding them. She didn't set a court date for new arguments.
Lawyers for the state argued the law sought to fill a vacuum left by the federal government's failure to rein in illegal immigration, which has burdened state coffers. Federal authorities argued the law pre-empted federal authority and paved the way for a patchwork of immigration laws to be drafted by different states.
The decision was applauded by civil-rights groups that contend the law would promote racial profiling. It was criticized by conservatives and many others who maintain the federal government has failed in its job to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S.
Janet Contreras, a member of the Greater Phoenix Tea Party Patriots who is running for Congress, said she was outraged. "It feels to me like the government's boots are on Arizona's throat," she said. "This is a complete dereliction of duty on the part of the federal government. They have now made it impossible for us to enforce our law."
Dan Pochoda, legal director of Arizona's American Civil Liberties Union, one of the attorneys on the case, said: "We are very pleased. It strikes at the heart of SB1070."
Lydia Guzman, president of Somos America, an Arizona coalition of 40 groups representing immigrants, said: "We are very excited to see the judge enjoined provisions that caused us extreme concern. It sets the tone for the long debate we expect to see in court."
Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School, cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the ruling. "She only ruled for the government as a preliminary matter," he said. "Her final ruling may differ. And higher courts could overturn today's decision."
"This is just the beginning of a very long--and very expensive--legal fight," said Julie Myers Wood, chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the Bush administration.
Arizona is the busiest human- and drug-smuggling corridor in the U.S., and home to 460,000 illegal immigrants, according to DHS. State legislators in late April passed the law, based on the principle of "attrition through enforcement," to compel illegal immigrants already in the state to leave and to staunch the flow into the state over the border from Mexico.
Polls show a majority of Arizona voters favor the law. Frustration over illegal immigration has been mounting in the state in recent years amid reports of kidnappings and gun battles on the state's highways and in the heart of Phoenix. Concerns about the poor economy and unemployment in the state also have contributed to dissatisfaction with illegal immigration.
The state has been buffeted by fallout from SB1070, including tourism boycotts and strained relations with Mexico, its biggest trading partner.
Other provisions of the law, which generated less controversy, will take effect Thursday. They include a section that makes it a state crime to harbor and transport illegal immigrants, and another that prohibits disruption of traffic to pick up a day laborer.
Seven lawsuits, including the one by the Justice Department, were filed to halt the law. Civil-rights groups and a Phoenix police officer had requested the judge to issue an injunction to prevent the law from taking effect. Judge Bolton applied her ruling to all the challenges.
The ruling came as police chiefs and sheriffs in Arizona were preparing their officers in crash courses to start enforcing the law. The law also prompted an unknown number of undocumented immigrant families to move to other states or back to their countries of origin. Others packed churches and community centers for coaching on how to deal with law enforcement, in case they were stopped.
Several immigrant-advocacy and human-rights groups had planned protests, including disobedience, on Thursday. Instead, tea-party activists moved to protest the decision late Wednesday afternoon.
As word of the judge's injunction spread late Wednesday morning, several dozen demonstrators gathered outside the federal courthouse--nearly all of them opponents of the law. As cars drove by, many honked in support. Other drivers shouted "Go home" at the demonstrators.
Armando MuÃ±iz, a 50-year-old Phoenix resident, summed up the prevailing mood. "This isn't a victory," he said. Like many other protesters, Mr. Muniz said he was preparing for a protracted court battle.
Some protesters held posters with slogans like "We Are All Illegal" and "Resist." The group started out several dozen strong, but thinned to just about 20 by noon.
The law's architect, state Sen. Russell Pearce, a Republican from Mesa, has devoted nearly a decade to drafting legislation to fight illegal immigration. One of them, a state employer-sanctions law, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 2008, is to be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court this fall.
Mr. Pearce has said he would introduce a bill to deny birthright citizenship to children born in Arizona to illegal immigrants, which is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.

Full text: Author: Alexander Theroux
The love story here may be super sad, but it is a joyride next to the chaos, violence and dysfunction that Gary Shteyngart's third novel attempts to depict--an apocalyptic, dying-empire America.
For its backdrop, "Super Sad True Love Story" offers the "Rupture," a futuroidal world in which the U.S. has all but collapsed, a war with Venezuela rages, the yuan backs America's cratered currency, military helicopters hover overhead with rotor blades whack-whacking, and armies of the poor and disenfranchised ("Low Net Worth Individuals") live in a tattered tent city in New York's Central Park. First Avenue is a "barbed-wire-strewn checkpoint." Tanks roll menacingly through the five boroughs.
If all that weren't bad enough, something called the New York Lifestyle Times has replaced the New York Times. Companies have merged into mega-entities and now have names like LandO'LakesGMFord. China, an economic supremo, threatens to foreclose on the U.S. Fear reigns. On billboards and signs, Big Brother Speak is everywhere. It is a nightmare.
Or is it? The foreground of "Super Sad True Love Story," as the title suggests, is a romantic narrative that, with a few tweaks of detail, could exist in the present moment. The romance is poignant, strange and improbable. It is also badly joined to the almost farcical dystopia that surrounds it, as if Mr. Shteyngart had two ideas and cobbled them into a mega-entity of his own.
A homely, balding, 39-year-old Jewish man from Flushing, N.Y., named Lenny Abramov, a NYU graduate and a self-conscious, almost comic momma's boy--an unlikely Romeo--feels "true love" for 24-year-old Eunice Park, a Korean-American from Fort Lee, N.J. He first meets her in Italy, where she is on an extended holiday, and then slavishly pursues her when she returns stateside, eventually talking her into living with him. It is the intensity of his ardor, his desperate need, that seems to win her over. That aspect of the love story is affecting, but it loses its charm after a while and in any case keeps getting intruded upon by Mr. Shteyngart's futuristic scenario.
Lenny, for instance, lives in a Lower East Side co-op, "a kind of instant Florida for those too frail or poor to relocate to Boca in time for their deaths." He is surrounded by "withered NORCers in motorized wheelchairs and their Jamaican caregivers." The co-op, it turns out, is part of a NORC, or "Naturally Occurring Retirement Community." Meanwhile, technology invades everyday life. People GlobalTrace each other with robotic regularity. We hear repeatedly about the efficient, omnifunctioning "Ã¤ppÃ¤rÃ¤t," a gadget that monitors people's biochemistry and rates their sex appeal. Reading books in this new age is rare. Books, in fact, are called "printed, bound media artifacts" and are considered "smelly and annoying." Lenny tries keeping his volumes fresh with sprays of Pine-Sol.
Obviously George Orwell's fingerprints are all over Mr. Shteyngart's novel. It is, in its way, a black-comedy version of "1984" but without a philosophical core or a steady worldview to guide its attempts at dark satire. Is Mr. Shteyngart pushing current trends to their extremes to mock current extremists (look out for China!) or to warn us of America's fate in the not-so-distant future (a militarized society)? Maybe his goal is simply comic fantasy, but the result is more silly than amusing and uneven in its effects, veering between menace and goofiness.
Equally uneven is the tale of Lenny's obsequious, obsessive feelings for pretty, powerful Eunice, told in the first person alongside Lenny's intermittent (and much too similar-sounding) diary entries. The love story, however touching at first, begins to seem wayward and confused. The lovers are a "mismatched pair." "Honestly," writes Eunice to a Korean girlfriend, "I'm afraid to see our reflection when we pass by a mirror." Eunice clearly rules the roost. Her young beauty gives her a leg up and before long will prove her lover's undoing.
It is often hard to see why Eunice is part of the romance at all. A Woody Allen-type nebbish, Lenny is a kvetcher ("My mind was full of sickening Jewish worry, the pogrom within and the pogrom without"); he frets about his age, his baldness and, in a major way, his parents. He is devoted to them, immigrants from Ukraine, to whom he is still little "Lyonitchka." "I became twelve years old as soon as I passed the mezuzah at the front door," he confesses. "I lack the genetic instinct to deal with unbridled authority. Before a greater force, I crumble."
At certain points, Lenny is a realistically portrayed lover with a markedly sweet, almost cloyingly sentimental but genuine sensibility. At other times he is nothing but a diffident, hand-wringing nitwit right out of a Jules Feiffer comic strip--someone we are meant to laugh at more than feel sympathy for. Mr. Shteyngart, whose gift for the acutely satirical was much in evidence in "Absurdistan" (2006), can't seem to decide what he is about here. The novel is tonally all over the place.
Mr. Shteyngart gives a good deal of attention to the anomalies and similarities of Jewish and Korean families. Although he has done commendable homework (Korean words like yamjanae, meeguk salam, ajumma and dolsot bap stick in the narrative like currants in a bun), the members of the Park family--the angry father, the hand-wringing mom, the chubby sister, their dreams and aspirations--feel as clichÃ©d as the Irish and Jewish families in the old Broadway hit "Abie's Irish Rose." Eunice's mother writes emails to her daughter: "Dating nice boy extra. But all the time you must to be careful with him because you are woman. Do not give away mystery. Are they any korea boy in rome?" This kind of thing is doubtless meant in good fun, but it feels lame, as do the ethnic-joke riffs that dot the narrative.
In the end, it may not matter. Not only does the romance fizzle but the beleaguered country itself, as portrayed here, seems to be too artificial to warrant our pity as it races toward its inevitable doom.
Mr. Theroux's latest novel is "Laura Warholic: Or, The Sexual Intellectual" (Fantagraphics).

New York police are stepping up their presence in the Staten Island neighborhood of Port Richmond amid an escalation of bias crimes against the Latino population.
On Tuesday, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said that additional uniformed and plainclothes officers will be deployed in the neighborhood.
"I'm concerned about the recent spike in bias crimes on Staten Island, and the threat it poses to individuals of Mexican descent in particular. We're devoting additional resources, beginning tonight, to address it." Mr. Kelly said.
About 20 patrol cars with two officers each will flood the area, chief police spokesman Paul Browne said. They will set up a mobile command center and two temporary observation towers in Port Richmond, where most of the attacks have been concentrated, he said.
Ten incidents in the area since April 5 are being investigated as hate crimes, including three reported within the past few days. The cases include victims who were beaten with baseball bats, some to the point of unconsciousness.
The city's Mexican Consulate, meanwhile, said it is dispatching personnel and a roving car to the neighborhood and that it was providing legal and social services to victims.
"We will act decisively in order to protect our citizens and will actively promote that those guilty of these vicious attacks are brought to justice expeditiously," RubÃ©n BeltrÃ¡n, Mexico's consul general in New York, said in a statement. "We are working hand-in-hand with local authorities on all levels," he said.
Nine of the attacks occurred in Port Richmond; the most recent, on Saturday, took place several miles away in Manor Heights.
The three recent attacks are being investigated by the police department's hate-crimes task force, but haven't been officially classified as bias crimes. Police have made arrests in three of the 10 cases.
The U.S. Justice Department's civil-rights division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District are monitoring the cases.
Mr. Kelly met with Mr. BeltrÃ¡n on Tuesday and asked him to spread the word that the NYPD isn't an immigration agency and that witnesses and victims of hate crimes shouldn't be deterred from coming forward regardless of their immigration status, Mr. Browne said. He said the NYPD will use an overtime pool that is used to fight jumps in crime levels to pay for the increased staffing.

Say you're a Democratic congressman running for re-election in the age of Obama. How do you persuade voters to stick with you?
reports that a Democratic senator who won't have to face the voters this year--he was re-elected in 2008--is offering some advice. It understates the case to say that it does not sound promising:
Senate Democrats are conceding that their signature legislative accomplishments could fall flat at the polls this fall and are endorsing a strategy that places a higher priority on raising fears among voters about Republicans and their agenda.
"I think it's to the Democrats' advantage to compare the Republicans to the Democrats, versus just a pure referendum on the Democrats," Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) said.
Pryor said a midterm campaign that revolves around his party's agenda and that of the White House is a losing proposition for the majority.
Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, elected in 2006 and thus also not up this year, adds: "We've certainly been frustrated by either our inability to or our lack of success in translating legislative achievements. So, we have to do better on that." Yeah, right:
"But I think it has to be more than that. You have to be able to make it very clear to people, if you vote for them and they take over the House or make gains in the Senate, here's what's going to happen.
"And the good news for us is, it's not theory," Casey continued. "We know when they had power in 2005, for example, they tried to privatize Social Security. We know that they've got a vouchers-in-Medicare proposal in their health care plan. There are some very important public policies that they've weighed in on."
So Democrats are going to try to stir up fear of Republicans. In one sense, to say this is to state the obvious. Politics is a zero-sum game, so it's always good to have a negative message about one's opponent as well as a positive one about oneself.
Even Ronald Reagan, in his , raised the specter of the Carter years: "Our opponents began this campaign hoping that America has a poor memory. Well, let's take them on a little stroll down memory lane." But upon returning from the stroll, Reagan reminded voters of the present:
In 1980 we asked the people of America, "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" Well, the people answered then by choosing us to bring about a change. We have every reason now, four years later, to ask that same question again, for we have made a change.
Democrats today have every reason not to ask if voters are better off than four years ago (when they took Congress) or two years ago (when they took the White House). "We know you're worse off, but it's not our fault!" is not a very compelling argument in itself, even allowing for the possibility that it is true.
So the "hope" campaign of 2008 gives way to the "fear" campaign of 2010. But trying to stir up fear of the Republicans has the added disadvantage of not being true. Republicans simply are not very fearsome at this time.
The Democratic National Committee has rolled out a and a titled "The Republican Tea Party Contract on America." This is a fictitious list of 10 legislative proposals that the Democrats impute to the Republicans, and that are supposed to scare voters.
Two of the items on the list, Nos. 1 (repeal ObamaCare) and 5 (repeal "Wall Street Reform"), represent efforts to run on the fear that the Dems' unpopular legislative agenda will be undone. If, as Pryor says, the positive message won't sell with voters, it is difficult to see how recasting it as a negative message will make it any more appealing.
Items No.2 and 3 repeat what Casey said about Social Security and Medicare. The remaining items: repeal the Bush tax increase (as some Democrats now advocate), "protect those responsible for the oil spill and future environmental catastrophes," abolish the Energy and Education departments and the Environmental Protection Agency, and "repeal the 17th Amendment," so that senators would be elected by state legislatures rather than popular vote.
Some of these proposals, though not all, would likely be unpopular, even "scary" to many voters. Some, though not all, do have the support of some, though not all, Republicans. But there is one thing all of these ideas have in common: None of them can be enacted without Democratic support in 2011 or 2012, even if Republicans win every congressional race this year.
All of these proposals would require the passage of legislation. Thus none can be enacted without President Obama's signature unless Congress overrides his veto. That requires a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress--a mathematical impossibility for Republicans in the 112th Congress. (One minor qualification: Proposing the repeal of the 17th Amendment would not require the president's signature, but it would require two-thirds votes in both houses.)
To gain a two-thirds majority in the House, 290 seats, the GOP would need to pick up 112 seats. The likelihood of such a large gain is only slightly greater than zero. A two-thirds majority in the Senate, 67 seats, would require the Republicans to pick up 26 seats. Only 19 Democratic seats are up this year, so even a clean sweep by Republicans--itself outside the realm of practical possibility--would not suffice.
A Republican House majority--more than half but less than two-thirds--is a plausible outcome. In the Senate, it is very likely that the GOP will gain seats, and there is an outside chance it will take a majority--but a filibuster-proof majority (60 seats), while a mathematical possibility, is not a practical one. The realistic upper limit is in the low 50s.
In this best-case scenario for Republicans, they would be able to prevent the Democrats from enacting any more of their agenda. We'd venture to say that makes two years of divided government a far less scary outcome for most voters than two more years of Democratic control.
A majority in the House would also give the Republicans some leverage to cut spending, since budget and appropriations bills require a majority vote. Using this leverage has its risks, as Newt Gingrich can testify--but in any case, too little spending is not the prospect that most frightens voters today.
In 2012, of course, things will be different--although it is impossible to say in what way. Perhaps the economy will have improved sufficiently that Obama will be able to ask "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" and get an affirmative answer, as Reagan did 28 years earlier. If Republicans do take the House and make gains in the Senate this year, maybe Obama will be able to frighten voters with the prospect that his opponent would sign the GOP's scary agenda into law. Or maybe voters will decide they've had enough of Obama and are willing to take that risk.
What is clear is that voters have no rational reason to fear Republican victory this year. So expect the Democrats to make a lot of irrational appeals to fear so as to turn out the base and limit their losses. The Democrats' campaign will be ugly. The only question is just how ugly the outcome will be for them.
Rep. Joe Sestak hopes to succeed Sen. Arlen Specter (R2D2, Pa.), whom he defeated in the Democratic primary. Republican nominee Pat Toomey is generally rated only a slight favorite, but a report in the Allentown Morning Call gives a hint of the troubles Democrats face this year:
Joe Sestak continued Monday to distance himself from Nancy Pelosi while at the same time tying his Republican opponent Pat Toomey to George W. Bush.
Sestak, speaking at the Pennsylvania Press Club, was asked whether he believes Speaker of the House Pelosi is a liberal or a pragmatist. Sestak describes himself as the latter.
He said he didn't know, but also said he never looks at her voting record.
"My office is forbidden to look at talking points that come out of the speaker's office," the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate said. "Look, I didn't agree with Nancy Pelosi when she endorsed Arlen Specter."
Sestak boasts that he disagrees with Pelosi 3% of the time. Seriously:
The subject is especially sensitive for Sestak, who recently lost a battle with Pennsylvania television stations to pull a commercial that says he "gives it 100 percent to Nancy Pelosi." Sestak argued that he hasn't voted with Pelosi every single time (it's about 97 percent ), but the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which paid for the ad, won the argument that on the big issues of the day--health care, energy, economic stimulus--Sestak has voted with Pelosi.
The Morning Call itself amusingly tries to dodge the liberal label: "High-profile political figures, such as Pelosi and President Barack Obama, who are linked to so-called liberal policies, are not viewed favorably in many areas of Pennsylvania."
So-called liberal policies? Who edits the Morning Call, ?
Stephen Prothero, a Boston University religious scholar, is "a regular CNN Belief Blog contributor." In a post to that blog, he writes:
How's this for a new argument against your local Islamic community center?
According to Ron Ramsey, Tennessee's Lieutenant Governor and a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial primary, Islam, the world's second largest religion, may not be a religion after all....
In a video of a recent stump speech posted by the Nashville Scene, Ramsey responds to a question about the "threat that's invading our country from the Muslims." Though he is careful to give a nod to the First Amendment..., he says that our Constitution's free exercise guarantees may not apply to Islam because it may be a "cult" rather than a "faith."
"I'm all about freedom of religion," Ramsey explains. "But you cross the line when they try to start bringing sharia law here to the state of Tennessee."
Prothero is certainly right that this is nuts. The First Amendment makes no distinction between a "faith" and a "cult." Further, in ordinary usage, the two factors that distinguish a cult from an established religion are novelty and small size. Islam has been around for more than 14 centuries and has hundreds of millions of adherents.
Although one might argue that certain Islamic movements of recent vintage can be characterized as cults (just as there are cults based in Christianity), the notion that Islam itself is a cult is preposterous.
Prothero, however, ought to engage in a bit of self-criticism. On his , he promotes his CNN piece with the following blurb: "In the Gospel according to the Tea Party, Islam is no longer a religion in Tennessee."
Where does Prothero get the idea that a crazy view expressed by one politician is "the Gospel according to the Tea Party"? Isn't this just the sort of invidious generalization that, when applied to Muslims, is termed "Islamophobia"?
The wacko conspiracy theory discussed privately by "Journolist" members and flogged publicly and relentlessly by The Atlantic Monthly is that Trig Palin is Sarah Palin's grandson, not her granddaughter as we said in an item yesterday (since corrected).
"A Roll Call headline we cited in an item yesterday actually read, 'Kerry: Good Policy Meets Good Politics.' We misread 'Meets' as 'Makes' and didn't notice our error until a reader pointed it out to us after publication. With the correct headline, our gag makes no sense. We regret the error."--correction, Best of the Web Today, WSJ.com, July27

John Kerry has agreed to cough up a cool half million dollars in state and local taxes "for his ultra-luxe yacht Isabel," the Boston Herald reports.
"They gave me a hat," the yachty, French-looking former junior senator from Massachusetts who by the way served in Vietnam, explained. "I have the hat to this day. I have the hat." Oh wait, wrong quote. Here's what he actually said, in a statement to the Herald:
"As we've said from the beginning, we have always complied with tax laws and we always will. ... The payment is being made promptly."
Although Kerry gave berth to Isabel in Rhode Island in an apparent attempt to avoid the tax, the Herald reports he might have owed it anyway:
According to state law, if Kerry brings that boat into Massachusetts waters in the first six months of owning it, there is a "presumption of use" and he would have to pony up some $437,500 to the state.
When asked yesterday at a Weymouth appearance if he had brought the Isabel into Bay State waters, Kerry replied, "It depends on who owns it." As the press pressed for more, Kerry added, "Can I get out of here, please."
For crying out loud, let the man eat his waffle! On a related note, see this report from the :
The leak of classified documents that suggest the American-backed Pakistani government has been secretly helping the Taliban has intensified scrutiny of the policy of Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman John Kerry, who has pushed for billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan as part of the Afghanistan war strategy.
Kerry, who first rose to prominence as a Vietnam veteran who protested that war, now finds himself increasingly under pressure from antiwar protesters who say his policy on Afghanistan is duplicating some of the same mistakes that led to US disasters in Vietnam.
Maybe he can throw his medals at himself.

A judge's ruling blocking major portions of Arizona's immigration law strengthened the Obama administration's hand in a battle over states rights that appears destined for the Supreme Court.
The ruling from U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton in Phoenix sided with the Justice Department on the most important federal arguments accusing the state of crossing a constitutional line with a law aimed at curbing illegal immigration.
Several other states are considering similar laws, amid broad anti-immigration sentiment, and the ruling likely will contribute to deterring some of them. Underscoring the political implications of the legal fight, Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer used her gubernatorial-campaign website to vow an appeal of the ruling, and the Republican Governors Association sent out a fund-raising letter from Ms. Brewer seeking donations.
The Arizona law, which was set to take effect Thursday, required state law enforcement to check the immigration status of people who are stopped for some other reasonable cause and who were suspected of being in the country illegally.
The judge based her findings on court precedents that support federal pre-emption of state laws found to conflict with or infringe upon federal authority.
The ruling went beyond what even Obama administration officials were expecting after a recent hearing in which the judge appeared skeptical of some federal arguments. Federal officials said U.S. government lawyers were preparing for a ruling that would recognize the federal government had legitimate arguments to offer at a trial but would allow much of the law to take effect in the meantime.
Instead, the judge ruled that the federal government's lawsuit was likely to succeed on multiple fronts. She ruled that the law was "likely to burden legally-present aliens" and quoted a Supreme Court directive that aliens should be free from "the possibility of inquisitorial practices and police surveillance."
She also ruled that because federal agencies would be required to complete immigration checks requested by state law-enforcement officials, the state was infringing on federal authority.
"The number of requests that will emanate from Arizona as a result of determining the status of every arrestee is likely to impermissibly burden federal resources and redirect federal agencies away from the priorities they have established," she wrote.
John Eastman, a professor at Chapman University Law School who recently made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination as California attorney general, said the judge "made a number of errors in law" including making a broader ruling than precedents allow.
"The claim that just simply having your law enforcement enforce federal law is a violation of federal law, that's just ludicrous," Mr. Eastman said.
The next step in the battle is an appeal of Judge Bolton's preliminary injunction before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which generally carries a liberal reputation.
The U.S. Supreme Court already is weighing an earlier Arizona law establishing penalties for employers who don't check the immigration status of employees. The Justice Department argues that the earlier law also impinges on federal immigration authority.
Federal courts have given the federal government wide latitude over immigration laws, dating to 1880s laws aimed at limiting Chinese migrants. But in recent decades, courts have also allowed state laws that rely on federal law for their force.
Jonathan Benner of Reed Smith LLP said the judge's ruling was "surgical" in carving out areas where he believed the state clearly crossed the line. "She's dealing with an area that's suffused with federal authority," he said.
"While we understand the frustration of Arizonans with the broken immigration system, a patchwork of state and local policies would seriously disrupt federal immigration enforcement and would ultimately be counterproductive," said Justice Department spokeswoman Hannah August.
Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, who had filed a brief in support of the Arizona law, said: "Today's ruling is a slap in the face to citizens who are trying to exercise their sovereignty and protect their borders."

The mood was celebratory in downtown Phoenix Wednesday after U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton blocked the most controversial parts of Arizona's tough new immigration law from taking effect.
In front of the state Capitol, hundreds of Mexican-Americans and other community members rejoiced, singing, waving flags and balloons, linking arms and dancing to live mariachi bands. Some of them said they would be there through the night.
Many of the demonstrators were members of religious groups, which have been holding peaceful protests and prayers here since late April, when Gov. Jan Brewer signed the bill into law. They stood before a vigil to the Virgin Mary decorated with white flowers, candles and palms.
"Thank the Lord! Gracias a Dios! He has been listening to us," cried Reverend Renalto Alvarez, raising his arms to the sky as the audience echoed him.
SB1070, as the law is known, requires police to check the immigration status of individuals they suspect are in the U.S. illegally during a stop for a routine infraction, such as a traffic violation.
By blocking that section of the law, a federal judge likely defused a clash between police and thousands of activists who had planned to engage in acts of civil obedience if the law took effect on July 29.
Polls have indicated that most Arizona voters favor the law, which they regard as a solution to the high cost of illegal immigration to the state. Opponents said it promotes racial profiling and harassment of Hispanics, who represent a large share of the U.S. citizens and legal immigrants who live in the border state. Most illegal immigrants are from Latin America.
In a lawsuit, the Obama administration argued SB1070 encroached on federal authority over immigration matters and asked that the judge issue a temporary injunction to prevent it from taking effect.
Some immigrants among the demonstrators swore to continue fighting SB1070 as it remains entangled in court challenges, possibly for years to come.
"Every father wants the best for his children," said Alberto Vega, a 35-year-old construction worker, who is undocumented, and said he came to the U.S. to give his children a better future. "It hurts to see them in this racist environment -- that's why I want this entire law revoked."
Many cars honked in a show of support as they passed by the demonstrators who walked around the block hoisting signs and shouting into megaphones.
A demonstration by local Tea Party members to protest the decision was canceled Wednesday afternoon because of permitting issues.
Sharelene Hanson, 60, was among the handful that showed up anyway. She said, "The judge took the teeth out of the bill and I'm enraged." She blamed illegal immigration for fueling criminal activity across the state.
Kelly Townsend, president of the Greater Phoenix Tea Party Patriots, said party leadership was meeting to discuss a plan of action.
"We are beyond protesting, and we need to be employing effective action strategy right now, not lifting our voices in protest."

Full text: A federal judge on Wednesday blocked most of a controversial Arizona immigration law just hours before it was to take effect, handing the Obama administration a win in the first stage of a legal battle expected to end up in the U.S. Supreme Court.
U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton in Phoenix issued a temporary injunction against parts of the law that would require police to determine the status of people they lawfully stopped and suspected were in the country illegally.
Bolton also forbade Arizona from making it a state crime to not carry immigration documents, and struck down two other provisions as an unconstitutional attempt by Arizona to undermine the federal government's efforts to enforce immigration policy.
In her 36-page decision, Bolton wrote that the provisions would have inevitably "swept up" legal immigrants and were "preempted" by the federal government's immigration authority.
"The court by no means disregards Arizona's interests in controlling illegal immigration and addressing the concurrent problems with crime," she wrote. But, she added, "it is not in the public interest for Arizona to enforce preempted laws."
Gov. Jan Brewer vowed a swift appeal to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. "We would have liked to have seen it all upheld, but a temporary injunction is not the end of it," she said through a smile after an appearance in Tucson. "I look at this as a little bump in the road."
Immigrant rights advocates, who had been gearing up for protests after the law takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, were ebullient.
"It's a victory for the community," said Lydia Guzman, president of Somos America, or We Are America. "It means justice will truly prevail."
Bolton's decision came as little surprise to many legal experts, who had predicted that the law, SB 1070, would be halted because it appeared to contradict U.S. Supreme Court precedent. Brewer signed the measure April 23, saying it is needed to protect Arizona from violence and lawlessness associated with illegal immigrants entering the country from Mexico.
Half of all people stopped for entering the country illegally are detained on Arizona's southern border.
Civil rights groups and then the Obama administration sued, contending that the measure would lead to racial profiling and interfere with the federal government's ability to regulate immigration. The law would allow Arizona, for example, to prosecute people the federal government might believe have a right to remain in the country, such as asylum seekers.
"While we understand the frustration of Arizonans with the broken immigration system, a patchwork of state and local policies would seriously disrupt federal immigration enforcement and would ultimately be counterproductive," the Justice Department said in a statement. "States can and do play a role in cooperating with the federal government in its enforcement of the immigration laws, but they must do so within our constitutional framework."
Many of the parts of the statute that Bolton, an appointee of President Clinton, allowed to go into effect are largely technical.
She preserved a clause that forbids any local entity from creating a policy of less than full enforcement of federal immigration laws, as well as a provision that makes it a misdemeanor to block traffic to solicit work or hire a worker -- an effort aimed at getting rid of day laborers.
But she found that the federal government was likely to prevail in trial in its arguments against the other provisions, making it likely that her temporary order will eventually become permanent, said Andy Hessick, a law professor at Arizona State University.
"It would be very surprising if the permanent injunction were to differ after trial," he said.
The law's author, state Sen. Russell Pearce, predicted in a television interview that the measure would be upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote -- an allusion to the majority of justices who are Republicans. But Gabriel "Jack" Chin, a law professor at the University of Arizona, said the issue may not break down in a partisan manner in the judiciary.
"I think they're going to hesitate to say the United States wants to let a person in because he might be able to give us information, but the state of Arizona can arrest him," Chin said. "For those saying, 'Wait till the conservative wing of the Supreme Court gets their hands on this,' I'm not so sure."
The Supreme Court will consider another Arizona law this fall. That law dissolves any business that repeatedly and knowingly hires illegal immigrants. The court may signal its view of SB 1070 in that decision.
In Arizona, where the immigration debate has grown to a deafening roar, the discussion was less about legal details and more about how illegal immigration has changed the state.
Faye Yanez, 65, and her husband were leaving a Home Depot in Tucson on Wednesday morning when they heard of the decision. "We feel slighted," said Yanez, a school teacher. "The state should have a right to take care of the state because the federal government isn't doing anything."
Susie Baker, 53, who remodels homes in Tucson, felt differently. "I am thrilled," she said as she headed into the store. "I think Jan Brewer is out of her mind. She is bringing harm to Arizona."
Baker said she often hires Latinos on home projects, and doesn't ask them their immigration status.
"To me, it doesn't matter," she said. "They are willing to do the work."
Politicians' reactions also were divided largely on whether they supported the bill. It received votes from all Republicans in the Legislature and no Democrats.
The state's two Republican U.S. senators, John Kyl -- who recommended Bolton for the federal bench -- and John McCain said in a statement that they were disappointed by the ruling. "Instead of wasting tax payer resources filing a lawsuit against Arizona and complaining that the law would be burdensome, the Obama administration should have focused its efforts on working with Congress to provide the necessary resources to support the state in its efforts to act where the federal government has failed to take responsibility," they said.
Outside the federal courthouse in Phoenix, Vice Mayor Michael Nowakowski, a Democrat and strong foe of the law, said debate over SB 1070 had been a sideshow that didn't make the state safer. He dismissed polls showing a majority of voters in Arizona and in the U.S. back the measure.
"Polls are for politicians before elections; they're not for civil rights," said Nowakowski, contending that many civil rights laws would have polled poorly in the 1950s and '60s.
Michelle Dallacroce, a Phoenix-based activist against illegal immigration, said she saw a silver lining in the ruling. "About a year or two ago, during the [presidential] elections, the media had a blackout on what was going on regarding illegal immigration," Dallacroce said. Now, immigration is constantly on the news. "In 2010," she said, "Arizona has jump-started this major issue."

Next step
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will consider whether to reverse the injunction halting Arizona's immigration law. That decision can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Regardless of the outcome, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton will hear a trial on SB 1070 and decide whether to make her injunction permanent or lift it. That ruling will be appealed to the 9th circuit, and then the U.S. Supreme Court. The process could take several years.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, an Australian hacker, may end up being one of the best things to ever happen to our American democracy.
It is not for politicians and bureaucrats to decide what American citizens and voters need to know. In the last 75 years, we have seen a sharp increase in the use of secrecy laws to cover up illegal activities, corruption and incompetence rather than to protect information that safeguards national security, as originally intended.
The George W. Bush administration was particularly guilty of this. Now, finally, we may get to know the truth as it happens -- not 25 years in the future, too late to be of use in voting decisions.
I plan to add WikiLeaks to my browser favorites.

WikiLeaks' ignoring the word "classified" on war materials that they leaked will help those who wish to kill us. This is all that the terrorists need to step up their attacks on our soldiers and our country.
When Justice Hugo Black and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of publication of the Pentagon Papers, as quoted in your editorial, they were talking about our government and our people, not the whole world.
How can you think that openness to our enemy is the perfect answer? We are in a war. The Times' logic escapes me.

The WikiLeaks files prove that we have "Charlie Wilson's War" redux.

The previous war destroyed the Soviet Union, and this one is destroying us. Declare victory and get out.

May the WikiLeaks Papers be this generation's Pentagon Papers -- and end a hopeless war.

History has shown us that when we wade deceitfully into foolhardy military engagements, the truth will out.
I am old enough to recall the Pentagon Papers and the sad finale, seven years later, of the Vietnam War.
And, as a long-retired Wall Street banker -- an alumnus of one of the outfits deemed "too big to fail" -- I'd like to see Assange train his forensic wizardry on behavior in the banking sector, which remains a threat to national security. I doubt the Fed will be equal to the job.

BP's CEO won't fall far
Re "BP's chief is expected to be gone this week,"
July 26
The Times reports, "Fairly or not, Hayward became a target of public rage."
Fairly or not? Really? Hayward is the Marie Antoinette of our time. I am curious what it is about Hayward that makes him so valuable that such a "clueless," awkward and tactless person was allowed to be the face of BP while continuously insulting us with his insensitive, bumbling conduct.
Indeed, Hayward is being replaced as CEO. But it has been reported he will have a role with a BP joint venture, undoubtedly with another large salary and posh status.
If BP wanted to show sincere regret for the spoiling of our natural resources, it should be off with her (his) head -- the complete sacking of Tony Hayward. But apparently it could not even give us that small measure of satisfaction.

Tax dollars-- and sense
Re "Let some tax cuts end, Geithner says," July 26
Since capitalism in the U.S. has brought us to this point, where 2% to 3% of the population controls the majority of the wealth, why would anyone who is not in that group think capitalism is working for the common citizen?
In 1960, a middle-class family could own a home and send children to college on the income of one wage-earner. Then came the Reagan tax cuts and it took two wage-earners in the middle-class family to achieve the same. Now the American dream is almost out of reach for the middle class.
Where has capitalism taken our democracy? To the rich only, if the Bush tax cuts are allowed to remain.
Shelly Lapides
Santa Susana
::
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner argues that allowing tax cuts to expire for the high-income producing is "the responsible thing to do."
Geithner forgot to pay his self-employment taxes for four years and deducted the cost of his kid's summer camp from his taxes. He does not seem qualified to define responsible.

CalPERScan't hide
Re "Probes may open books at CalPERS," July 25
I applaud The Times for its quest for the truth regarding the California Public Employees' Retirement System's investments.
The taxpayer continues to pay the bill for the mismanagement of this out-of-control organization, and the time for effective oversight is now.
Allowing CalPERS to hire its own firm to conduct an audit is like asking the fox to guard the henhouse.
It is unconscionable that California taxpayers are forced to pay for the public "servant" entitlement programs. Why do we have to pay the price of poor management of CalPERS funds? In the private sector, if your financial advisor makes bad decisions and you lose retirement money, you don't go to the state and get reimbursed for losses.
While on vacation recently, my wife and I met a retired firefighter from Ventura. He boasted that he retired at 55, makes more in retirement benefits today than his full-time compensation had been and that his pension goes up every year.
We must stop this insanity before we end up like Greece.
Randy Bick

What is the matter with California's public employees? They should be screaming and pulling their hair out over this mismanagement.
If taxpayers have to pick up the tab for losses, CalPERS should get out of the employee investment business.

Isn't it just free speech?
Re "Fervor fueled by hate," Opinion, July 26
The fact that supposedly fewer illegal immigrants are attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border these days is no reason to ignore the fact that millions of them are already here, draining the resources of those who live here legally. Should the police relax their stance against bank robbers and drug dealers because those particular crimes are on the decline?
As for not allowing the publication of the opinion of anyone deemed a "nut-job" by Gregory Rodriguez, I certainly hope he would extend this to include those of the far left in their rants against Sarah Palin. Oh, wait -- that was just free speech. Silly me.

Full text: Yesterday, after months of heated rhetoric and debate about Arizona's controversial new immigration law, federal Judge Susan Bolton blocked most of SB 1070 from taking effect. The move served as an important affirmation of the federal government's responsibility in enforcing our nation's immigration laws. But regardless of what happened with this case, this administration will continue to enforce the law, just as we have been doing for the past 18 months: with unprecedented resources and a clear commitment to serious, smart and effective enforcement that has yielded important results.
We are career prosecutors who lead the two main border and immigration enforcement agencies in the United States -- U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). We know the paramount importance of enforcing the law and we understand the federal government's responsibilities. And what we have seen on the border, at workplaces, and in communities across America in the past 18 months represents the most serious approach to enforcement we have witnessed in our careers.
At the border we have concentrated unprecedented amounts of manpower, infrastructure and technology. Today, the Border Patrol is better staffed than at any time in its history -- nearly doubling in personnel since 2004 to more than 20,000 today. ICE has a quarter of all its personnel in the Southwest border region, also the most ever. There is more fencing and other infrastructure than ever before. And more technology, improving the ability to detect illegal movements at all times of day and night.
We have engaged in high levels of cooperation with Mexico to crack down on smuggling. And we have provided more funding than ever before to local law enforcement in border communities to deal with border-related crime.
As a result, the numbers are clearly moving in the right direction: Last year, illegal crossings along the Southwest border were down 23%, to a fraction of their all-time high. Seizures of contraband rose significantly across the board in 2009 -- illegal bulk cash, illegal weapons and illegal drugs. By all measurable standards, crime in U.S. border towns has remained flat for most of the last decade.
At the same time, this administration knows that more can be done. That is why the president authorized the deployment of up to 1,200 National Guard troops to support federal law enforcement on the border. He has also asked Congress for $600 million in supplemental funding, which reflects the administration's understanding that the assets we have must be a permanent part of a long-term, systematic effort to deny, disrupt and defeat the activities of transnational criminal organizations that smuggle illicit drugs, people, weapons and bulk cash across our border with Mexico.
Throughout the country, we have made enforcement of immigration laws smarter and more effective. We have made cracking down on drug cartels and deporting convicted criminal aliens who threaten public safety a priority. And we have achieved results.
Programs like Secure Communities, which identifies illegal immigrants already in state and local jails who have committed crimes have been expanded. Last year, we deported a record number of felons who were in the country illegally.
ICE investigates and prosecutes employers who have a history of knowingly employing an illegal work force. Instead of focusing on high-profile worksite enforcement actions, or "raids," this administration has already audited more companies to check their compliance with federal law than the last administration did during its entire time in office. To help employers comply with the law, the administration continues to improve and expand the E-Verify program, a web-based system that allows employers to verify the employment eligibility of new hires.
In all, more is being done -- and more results are being achieved -- to secure the border and enforce the law than ever before. This is important work that we will continue -- throughout the nation and in Arizona -- as we remain committed to actively working with members of Congress from both parties to make necessary reforms to our immigration laws.
Meanwhile, this administration remains committed to enforcing the laws we have in the smartest and most effective way possible. The progress we've already made shows why it's so critical to continue pushing forward.

Full text: A judge's ruling blocking major portions of Arizona's immigration law strengthened the Obama administration's hand in a battle over states rights that appears destined for the Supreme Court.
The ruling from U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton in Phoenix sided with the Justice Department on the most important federal arguments accusing the state of crossing a constitutional line with a law aimed at curbing illegal immigration.
Several other states are considering similar laws, amid broad anti-immigration sentiment, and the ruling likely will contribute to deterring some of them. Underscoring the political implications of the legal fight, Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer used her gubernatorial-campaign website to vow an appeal of the ruling, and the Republican Governors Association sent out a fund-raising letter from Ms. Brewer seeking donations.
The Arizona law, which was set to take effect Thursday, required state law enforcement to check the immigration status of people who are stopped for some other reasonable cause and who were suspected of being in the country illegally.
The judge based her findings on court precedents that support federal pre-emption of state laws found to conflict with or infringe upon federal authority.
The ruling went beyond what even Obama administration officials were expecting after a recent hearing in which the judge appeared skeptical of some federal arguments. Federal officials said U.S. government lawyers were preparing for a ruling that would recognize the federal government had legitimate arguments to offer at a trial but would allow much of the law to take effect in the meantime.
Instead, the judge ruled that the federal government's lawsuit was likely to succeed on multiple fronts. She ruled that the law was "likely to burden legally-present aliens" and quoted a Supreme Court directive that aliens should be free from "the possibility of inquisitorial practices and police surveillance."
She also ruled that because federal agencies would be required to complete immigration checks requested by state law-enforcement officials, the state was infringing on federal authority.
"The number of requests that will emanate from Arizona as a result of determining the status of every arrestee is likely to impermissibly burden federal resources and redirect federal agencies away from the priorities they have established," she wrote.
John Eastman, a professor at Chapman University Law School who recently made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination as California attorney general, said the judge "made a number of errors in law" including making a broader ruling than precedents allow.
The next step in the battle is an appeal of Judge Bolton's preliminary injunction before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which generally carries a liberal reputation.
The U.S. Supreme Court already is weighing an earlier Arizona law establishing penalties for employers who don't check the immigration status of employees. The Justice Department argues that the earlier law also impinges on federal immigration authority.
Jonathan Benner of Reed Smith LLP said the judge's ruling was "surgical" in carving out areas where he believed the state clearly crossed the line. "She's dealing with an area that's suffused with federal authority," he said.
"While we understand the frustration of Arizonans with the broken immigration system, a patchwork of state and local policies would seriously disrupt federal immigration enforcement and would ultimately be counterproductive," said Justice Department spokeswoman Hannah August.
Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, who had filed a brief in support of the Arizona law, said: "Today's ruling is a slap in the face to citizens who are trying to exercise their sovereignty and protect their borders."
What the Judge Said
About the statute:
Arizona can't make police officers try to determine the immigration status of people they stop or arrest just because they have reasonable suspicion the person is in the U.S. illegally.
It also can't require that someone remain in custody until immigration status is verified
The state can't criminalize the failure to apply for or carry registration papers, or make it a crime for an undocumented immigrant to apply for or accept a job. It can't authorize a warrantless arrest where there is probable cause to believe someone has committed a deportable offense.
About its prospects:
That 'Arizona would impose a. . .burden on legal resident aliens that only the federal government has the authority to impose' and that the Obama administration 'is likely to succeed on the merits' of its challenge.
That preserving the status quo through a preliminary injunction is less harmful than allowing it to be enforced.

Full text: PHOENIX -- A federal judge Wednesday temporarily blocked key parts of Arizona's new immigration law on the eve of implementation, saying it was unlikely the state would prevail in legal challenges to such provisions as requiring police to question and detain suspected illegal immigrants following routine stops.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton granted the Obama administration's request for a preliminary injunction on the grounds that immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government, not states. Arizona said it would appeal the decision in what could be a protracted legal battle with Washington.
Since Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed the legislation on April 23, the new law has sparked a national debate over illegal immigration and become a central issue in midterm elections across the U.S. Inspired by Arizona, legislators and candidates in states stretching from Florida to Colorado have said they would draft similar laws to tackle illegal immigration. All told, about two dozen states are considering such laws.
"This fight is far from over. In fact, it is just the beginning," Gov. Brewer said. Arizona will file an expedited appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, she said, and "battle all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary, for the right to protect the citizens of Arizona."
Matthew Chandler, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration, said, the court's decision "correctly affirms the federal government's responsibilities in enforcing our nation's immigration laws."
He said the Obama administration had dedicated "unprecedented resources" to secure the border, and would continue to focus resources on "criminal aliens who pose a public safety threat and employers who knowingly hire illegal labor."
In her 36-page court order, Judge Bolton blocked several provisions of the new law, which was to take effect Thursday. Most notably, she blocked a requirement that police check the immigration status of people stopped for such routine infractions as traffic violations, if police suspect they are in the U.S. illegally. She also blocked a section that required law enforcement to detain individuals until their legal status was clarified.
"There is a substantial likelihood that officers will wrongfully arrest legal resident aliens under the new [law],"" Judge Bolton wrote. "By enforcing this statute, Arizona would impose a 'distinct, unusual and extraordinary' burden on legal resident aliens that only the federal government has the authority to impose."
She also blocked a section that required foreigners to carry documents proving they had permission to be in the U.S., and another provision that banned illegal immigrants from seeking work in Arizona.
The judge said the sections of the law, known as SB1070, should not go into effect until the court addresses issues surrounding them. She didn't set a court date for new arguments.
Lawyers for the state argued the law sought to fill a vacuum left by the federal government's failure to rein in illegal immigration, which has burdened state coffers. Federal authorities argued the law pre-empted federal authority and paved the way for a patchwork of immigration laws to be drafted by different states.
The decision was applauded by civil-rights groups that contend the law would promote racial profiling. It was criticized by conservatives and many others who maintain the federal government has failed in its job to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S.
Janet Contreras, a member of the Greater Phoenix Tea Party Patriots who is running for Congress, said she was outraged. "It feels to me like the government's boots are on Arizona's throat," she said. "This is a complete dereliction of duty on the part of the federal government. They have now made it impossible for us to enforce our law."
Dan Pochoda, legal director of Arizona's American Civil Liberties Union, one of the attorneys on the case, said: "We are very pleased. It strikes at the heart of SB1070."
Lydia Guzman, president of Somos America, an Arizona coalition of 40 groups representing immigrants, said: "We are very excited to see the judge enjoined provisions that caused us extreme concern. It sets the tone for the long debate we expect to see in court."
Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School, cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the ruling. "She only ruled for the government as a preliminary matter," he said. "Her final ruling may differ. And higher courts could overturn today's decision."
Arizona is the busiest human- and drug-smuggling corridor in the U.S., and home to 460,000 illegal immigrants, according to DHS. State legislators in late April passed the law, based on the principle of "attrition through enforcement," to compel illegal immigrants already in the state to leave and to stanch the flow into the state over the border from Mexico.
Polls show a majority of Arizona voters favor the law. Frustration over illegal immigration has been mounting in the state in recent years amid reports of kidnappings and gun battles on the state's highways and in the heart of Phoenix. Concerns about the poor economy and unemployment in the state also have contributed to dissatisfaction with illegal immigration.
Since late April, the state has been buffeted by fallout from SB1070, including tourism boycotts and strained relations with Mexico, its top trading partner.
Other provisions of the law, which generated less controversy, will take effect Thursday. They include a section that makes it a state crime to harbor and transport illegal immigrants, and another that prohibits disruption of traffic to pick up a day laborer.
Seven lawsuits, including the one by the Justice Department, were filed to halt the law. Civil-rights groups and a Phoenix police officer had requested the judge to issue an injunction to prevent the law from taking effect. Judge Bolton applied her ruling to all the challenges.
The ruling came as police chiefs and sheriffs in Arizona were preparing their officers in crash courses to start enforcing the law. The law also prompted an unknown number of undocumented immigrant families to move to other states or back to their countries of origin. Others packed churches and community centers for coaching on how to deal with law enforcement.
Several immigrant-advocacy and human-rights groups had planned protests, including disobedience, on Thursday. Instead, tea-party activists moved to protest the decision late Wednesday afternoon.
As word of the judge's injunction spread late Wednesday morning, several dozen demonstrators gathered outside the federal courthouse -- nearly all of them opponents of the law. As cars drove by, many honked in support. Other drivers shouted "Go home" at the demonstrators.

Even before the vote, Democrats faulted Republicans for opposing the bill because it pays for the program by re-applying a tax on foreign-registered firms with U.S. operations. The GOP called that a tax hike; Democrats said the move closes a tax loophole, and suggested those who oppose the bill are putting corporate wealth ahead of sick first responders.
"There is a choice here: Either support the bill and the victims of 9/11 or oppose it because of foreign corporate interests trying to avoid taxes here in the United States," said Rep. Joseph Crowley, a Queens Democrat, who said he's frustrated that no one on the Republican side seems willing to negotiate a solution to the impasse.
That infuriated Long Island Republican Rep. Peter King, who supports the bill but called the Democratic majority's handling of the issue "total moral cowardice."
"The Democrats are afraid of a tough vote, and they'd rather let cops and firefighters die," said Mr. King, who added that New York Democrats are covering for the timidity of their party leaders.
Democratic congressman Michael McMahon of Staten Island responded to Mr. King's comments: "I'm not quite sure what he's squealing about . . . . If he can't deliver the votes then he shouldn't be pointing fingers."
About a dozen or so Republicans are expected to support the measure.
Late Wednesday evening. Messrs. Crowley, McMahon, and six other New York Democrats sent Mr. King a letter saying two-thirds of Democrats had agreed to support the bill, and asking how many of the Republicans have agreed to vote yes. The back-and-forth is noteworthy because it has been rare for members of the New York delegation to take jabs at each other on the issue of Sept. 11-related programs.
Democrats had planned a vote on the program Wednesday, but pushed it back a day as they tried desperately to muster enough votes. But passage doesn't look likely, particularly since they have decided to use a procedure called suspension to avoid amendments on immigration and health care being attached to the bill.
Under suspension, a measure needs a two-thirds majority to pass, and on Wednesday neither side believed the bill had enough support.
Democrats chose that route because they feared a traditional floor vote would lead to an amendment explicitly barring any illegal immigrants from receiving care under the program. Another fear for the Democrats is that Republicans would offer an amendment undercutting the major health-care overhaul bill that passed earlier this year.
The 9/11 bill in question would spend $7.4 billion over 10 years to provide treatment to those sickened after exposure to Ground Zero, and re-open a compensation fund.
Facing another setback, some Ground Zero worker groups are already furious at Congress, suggesting there will be more protests on the issue.
Supporters of the bill say if it does fail Thursday, they will try to revive it in two months, in the hopes that forcing public votes on the issue will eventually pressure enough lawmakers to support the legislation.

Full text: Super Sad True Love Story
By Gary Shteyngart
(Random House, 334 pages, $26)
The love story here may be super sad, but it is a joyride next to the chaos, violence and dysfunction that Gary Shteyngart's third novel attempts to depict -- an apocalyptic, dying-empire America.
For its backdrop, "Super Sad True Love Story" offers the "Rupture," a futuroidal world in which the U.S. has all but collapsed, a war with Venezuela rages, the yuan backs America's cratered currency, military helicopters hover overhead with rotor blades whack-whacking, and armies of the poor and disenfranchised ("Low Net Worth Individuals") live in a tattered tent city in New York's Central Park. First Avenue is a "barbed-wire-strewn checkpoint." Tanks roll menacingly through the five boroughs.
If all that weren't bad enough, something called the New York Lifestyle Times has replaced the New York Times. Companies have merged into mega-entities and now have names like LandO'LakesGMFord. China, an economic supremo, threatens to foreclose on the U.S. Fear reigns. On billboards and signs, Big Brother Speak is everywhere. It is a nightmare.
Or is it? The foreground of "Super Sad True Love Story," as the title suggests, is a romantic narrative that, with a few tweaks of detail, could exist in the present moment. The romance is poignant, strange and improbable. It is also badly joined to the almost farcical dystopia that surrounds it, as if Mr. Shteyngart had two ideas and cobbled them into a mega-entity of his own.
A homely, balding, 39-year-old Jewish man from Flushing, N.Y., named Lenny Abramov, a NYU graduate and a self-conscious, almost comic momma's boy -- an unlikely Romeo -- feels "true love" for 24-year-old Eunice Park, a Korean-American from Fort Lee, N.J. He first meets her in Italy, where she is on an extended holiday, and then slavishly pursues her when she returns stateside, eventually talking her into living with him. It is the intensity of his ardor, his desperate need, that seems to win her over. That aspect of the love story is affecting, but it loses its charm after a while and in any case keeps getting intruded upon by Mr. Shteyngart's futuristic scenario.
Lenny, for instance, lives in a Lower East Side co-op, "a kind of instant Florida for those too frail or poor to relocate to Boca in time for their deaths." He is surrounded by "withered NORCers in motorized wheelchairs and their Jamaican caregivers." The co-op, it turns out, is part of a NORC, or "Naturally Occurring Retirement Community." Meanwhile, technology invades everyday life. People GlobalTrace each other with robotic regularity. We hear repeatedly about the efficient, omnifunctioning "apparat," a gadget that monitors people's biochemistry and rates their sex appeal. Reading books in this new age is rare. Books, in fact, are called "printed, bound media artifacts" and are considered "smelly and annoying." Lenny tries keeping his volumes fresh with sprays of Pine-Sol.
Obviously George Orwell's fingerprints are all over Mr. Shteyngart's novel. It is, in its way, a black-comedy version of "1984" but without a philosophical core or a steady worldview to guide its attempts at dark satire. Is Mr. Shteyngart pushing current trends to their extremes to mock current extremists (look out for China!) or to warn us of America's fate in the not-so-distant future (a militarized society)? Maybe his goal is simply comic fantasy, but the result is more silly than amusing and uneven in its effects, veering between menace and goofiness.
Equally uneven is the tale of Lenny's obsequious, obsessive feelings for pretty, powerful Eunice, told in the first person alongside Lenny's intermittent (and much too similar-sounding) diary entries. The love story, however touching at first, begins to seem wayward and confused. The lovers are a "mismatched pair." "Honestly," writes Eunice to a Korean girlfriend, "I'm afraid to see our reflection when we pass by a mirror." Eunice clearly rules the roost. Her young beauty gives her a leg up and before long will prove her lover's undoing.
It is often hard to see why Eunice is part of the romance at all. A Woody Allen-type nebbish, Lenny is a kvetcher ("My mind was full of sickening Jewish worry, the pogrom within and the pogrom without"); he frets about his age, his baldness and, in a major way, his parents. He is devoted to them, immigrants from Ukraine, to whom he is still little "Lyonitchka." "I became twelve years old as soon as I passed the mezuzah at the front door," he confesses. "I lack the genetic instinct to deal with unbridled authority. Before a greater force, I crumble."
At certain points, Lenny is a realistically portrayed lover with a markedly sweet, almost cloyingly sentimental but genuine sensibility. At other times he is nothing but a diffident, hand-wringing nitwit right out of a Jules Feiffer comic strip -- someone we are meant to laugh at more than feel sympathy for. Mr. Shteyngart, whose gift for the acutely satirical was much in evidence in "Absurdistan" (2006), can't seem to decide what he is about here. The novel is tonally all over the place.
Mr. Shteyngart gives a good deal of attention to the anomalies and similarities of Jewish and Korean families. Although he has done commendable homework (Korean words like yamjanae, meeguk salam, ajumma and dolsot bap stick in the narrative like currants in a bun), the members of the Park family -- the angry father, the hand-wringing mom, the chubby sister, their dreams and aspirations -- feel as cliched as the Irish and Jewish families in the old Broadway hit "Abie's Irish Rose." Eunice's mother writes emails to her daughter: "Dating nice boy extra. But all the time you must to be careful with him because you are woman. Do not give away mystery. Are they any korea boy in rome?" This kind of thing is doubtless meant in good fun, but it feels lame, as do the ethnic-joke riffs that dot the narrative.
In the end, it may not matter. Not only does the romance fizzle but the beleaguered country itself, as portrayed here, seems to be too artificial to warrant our pity as it races toward its inevitable doom.

Abstract: Jane Norton, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Colorado, had a hunch that by dinnertime Wednesday, conservative voters across the state would have heard about a federal judge blocking much of Arizona's immigration law. Former U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo, an anti-illegal immigration firebrand who is running for Colorado governor on a third-party ticket, predicted the ruling would motivate conservatives, tea-party activists and all voters who are so sick of the federal government.

Full text: Jane Norton, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Colorado, had a hunch that by dinnertime Wednesday, conservative voters across the state would have heard about a federal judge blocking much of Arizona's immigration law.
She had a hunch they would be angry.
So Ms. Norton's campaign ordered up a new round of robocalls, informing voters that Ms. Norton was proud to have been endorsed by one of the immigration law's strongest advocates, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. The campaign had already called 80,000 Republican voters. Now, it planned to call 100,000 more, said Josh Penry, Ms. Norton's campaign manager.
The calls to Colorado voters Wednesday night were just one sign that the federal ruling in Arizona is likely to ripple through this heated campaign season.
Republicans quickly denounced both the ruling and the Obama Justice Department for challenging the law in the first place. Some said the ruling would further energize voters who are angry about what they see as federal overreach on health care and other issues.
Rep. John Boozman, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Arkansas, said he expected the judge's ruling to further rile voters and motivate them to reject Democratic incumbents. "It's a defining issue," Mr. Boozman said. Mr. Boozman takes questions at every town hall, he said, and "this will come up at every one."
Democrats, divided on the issue and running against stiff political headwinds, were unsure how the ruling would play out.
Some called it an unhelpful distraction from the campaigns they have been building around jobs, economic themes and border enforcement. Pat Waak, chairwoman of the Colorado Democratic Party, said candidates can't win in the fall if they aren't talking about jobs and the economy.
"We're not talking about credit-card companies not being able to take advantage of you, or student loans," she said. "We have to be the messengers of what affects your life."
Other Democrats said U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton had usefully inserted herself between the two political lightning rods -- the Arizona law and the Obama administration.
Rep. Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.), who had encouraged the Justice Department suit, said Democrats can now say that however one feels about the Arizona law, major elements of it have been put into question by a judge. "This helps Democrats talk about solutions," he said in an interview.
The judge's ruling doesn't order Congress to act, and lawmakers have shown little interest this year in tackling the issue. But if immigrant-rights advocates and anti-illegal immigration activists agree the current system is broken, they appear to have no choice but to press for congressional action.
"I'm hoping that this has turbocharged that understanding and sent it from Arizona straight to Capitol Hill, where we really need to be having this discussion," said Angela Kelley of the Center for American Progress, a group with close ties to the White House. She is an advocate for an immigration overhaul that includes a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. "At some point, you've got to eat your vegetables," she said.
But for Democrats, the turbocharge might be at the polls, and to their disadvantage. William Gheen, president of the anti-illegal immigrant Americans for Legal Immigration, called Wednesday for all congressional incumbents to be ousted in November.
"There's a wave of anger sweeping across this nation today as people of all races and political affiliations feel that we the people have been betrayed by this president and this judge," he said.
Former U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo, an anti-illegal immigration firebrand who is running for Colorado governor on a third-party ticket, predicted the ruling would motivate conservatives, tea-party activists and all voters who "are so sick of the federal government."
"This action will stoke the fires of states' rights throughout this country, and well it should," Mr. Tancredo said.
In Arizona, Democratic House members in swing districts -- Reps. Harry Mitchell, Ann Kirkpatrick and Gabrielle Giffords -- had denounced the Justice Department's effort to block the state law. Ms. Kirkpatrick said Wednesday that the ruling wouldn't end the legal fight.
"Elected officials would be wise to stop talking about distractions and focus on their constituents," Ms. Kirkpatrick said, vowing to press for federal action on a border-security law this fall.
Obama administration officials said the ruling should force Republicans who sided with a bipartisan effort on immigration in 2006 and 2007 to come back to the table.
And administration officials said they believe that after the midterm elections, the debate will shift. In their view, an energized Republican base might drive the results this November. But the 2012 presidential election, which will draw a far larger number of voters to the polls, will likely turn on swing voters, including Latinos in key states such as Colorado and Nevada, administration officials said.
"I find it incomprehensible that Republicans are almost unanimously negative on this decision," New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said. "It's just alienating Hispanic voters . . . . If Republicans continue to block efforts for comprehensive reform, they're going to suffer at the polls. "

The ruling temporarily enjoined several provisions of the new law, which was to take effect Thursday, on the grounds that immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government, not states. Most notably, the injunction blocks a requirement that police check the immigration status of people stopped for such routine infractions as traffic violations, if police suspect they are in the U.S. illegally.
Arizona said it would appeal the ruling. Gov. Brewer vowed "to battle all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary."

If you do not, that is a longer discussion. But if you do, let me tackle some agencies you may be interested in targeting:
Under Department of Homeland Security you may want to look at the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters (HQ), General Counsel and other offices at www.dhs.gov/files/immigration.shtm; look on the link above and see who is focused on these issues.
U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services at www.uscis.gov/forms.
Cache U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at www.ice.gov/.
Department of Justice the Executive Office for Immigration Review at www.justice.gov/eoir/.
Labor Department at www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-ina.htm.
State Department at travel.state.gov/visa/immigrants/types/types_1310.html.
Social Security & Entering the United States at www.ssa.gov/immigration/.
These are just a few to begin targeting. I hope this helps and gets you started on the right track.
I wish you much success!
Dortch Tip:
The Office of Personnel Management has developed a frequently asked questions (FAQ) section that is pretty helpful in answering many questions about federal employment and related topics. I can't say that it answers every single question you might have, but its a good starting point to try to find out information.
You can find it by clicking on www.opm.gov/faqs/

Full text: THE DECISION by U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton to block the enforcement of several provisions of a controversial Arizona immigration law is a good first step toward reversing a discriminatory measure that should never have been adopted.
Most important, Judge Bolton was right to prevent state law enforcement officers from demanding immigration papers from those they "reasonably" believe are in the United States illegally. The judge noted that such stops would probably mean that legal residents and U.S. citizens would be "swept up" by this obnoxious and patently xenophobic requirement. She also put a hold on enforcement of a new provision that would have subjected immigrants to criminal penalties for failing to apply for or carry alien registration papers. These provisions were set to go into effect Thursday. The judge must decide in coming weeks whether the parts of the law she froze in place should be permanently struck down as unconstitutional.
The Phoenix-based judge's decision came in the wake of a challenge from the Justice Department, which argued that the Arizona law usurped the federal government's exclusive constitutional authority to establish immigration policy. The department also argued that the state's interference in immigration policies would impermissibly force the federal government to redirect resources away from the priorities established by the U.S. government and that such interference would trample on the federal government's prerogatives regarding foreign policy.
These arguments did not always carry the day. The judge, for example, analyzed each part of the law individually, declining the Justice Department's invitation to find the entire law constitutionally offensive. Using this approach, the judge concluded that Arizona was within its bounds in allowing legal residents of the state to sue state officials or agencies that restrict enforcement of federal immigration laws. We would have preferred a broader ruling striking down the law in its entirety, but Judge Bolton issued a thoughtful and well-reasoned decision that merits respect.
There is little doubt that some on the right will find reason to berate Judge Bolton and use her decision as political fodder to stir up anti-immigrant, anti-court and anti-federal sentiment. This would be wrong. What is needed is not more vitriol but increased cooperation in crafting a comprehensive federal immigration reform bill to address the legitimate concerns of states such as Arizona.

Full text: A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the most contested provisions of Arizona's new immigration law one day before they were to take effect, ratcheting up the legal and political debate over the increasingly divisive issue.
U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton's ruling handed the Obama administration a key initial victory in its lawsuit against Arizona and Gov. Jan Brewer (R). It also set up a legal struggle that is likely to play out over several years and across numerous states, with Brewer vowing to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court and legal experts saying the high court is likely to hear it.
In her decision, Bolton accepted the Justice Department's argument that the law -- which empowers police to question people who they have a "reasonable suspicion" are illegal immigrants -- intrudes into federal immigration enforcement. She granted much of an injunction the administration had sought, blocking portions of the law from taking effect while the federal lawsuit proceeds.
The judge put on hold provisions that would require police to check immigration status if they stop someone while enforcing other laws, allow for warrantless arrests of suspected illegal immigrants and criminalize the failure of immigrants to carry registration papers. Civil rights groups and federal lawyers had objected to those provisions in particular, while Arizona officials defended them as necessary to fight a tide of illegal immigration.
"Requiring Arizona law enforcement officials and agencies to determine the immigration status of every person who is arrested burdens lawfully present aliens because their liberty will be restricted while their status is checked," wrote Bolton, a Democratic appointee, who allowed other, less-controversial portions of the law to take effect Thursday as scheduled.
The injunction is preliminary and does not guarantee that the administration will prevail in its effort over the next several months to have the entire law declared unconstitutional. But preliminary injunctions must meet a high legal standard, and Bolton specified that the government "is likely to succeed on the merits" of much of its argument.
"The judge is sending a signal to the state: 'You're going to have a tough time,' " said Jonathan Benner, a Washington lawyer who has argued numerous cases involving federal-state conflicts.
Yet even as the contours of the legal case, which the Justice Department filed July 6, became more clear, the political din over the nation's estimated 12 million illegal immigrants grew louder. Republicans condemned Bolton's decision and what they called the administration's failure to fight illegal immigration. They were led by Brewer, who also criticized unspecified "fear-mongers, those dealing in hate" and others who have spurred economic boycotts of the state.
"I will battle all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary," said Brewer, whose popularity has increased ahead of her reelection bid this fall. She vowed to appeal Bolton's ruling Thursday to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and to ask for an expedited review. Experts said that full court, which is controlled by a 15 to 10 Democratic-appointed majority, is unlikely to side with Arizona.
The Supreme Court -- with a working conservative majority -- accepts a fraction of appeals but may take this case because it presents a conflict of federal and state law, said Cristina Rodriguez, an expert on immigration and constitutional law at New York University Law School.
Legislatures in 17 states have introduced bills like the Arizona law, with the political climate in Utah, Oklahoma and South Carolina relatively favorable for passage. South Carolina state Sen. Larry Martin (R), who co-sponsored that state's legislation, said the ruling will not deter him. "We're still early in the innings of a major legal contest," he said.
In Arizona, opponents of the law who had been planning campaigns of civil disobedience on Thursday said they were pleased with the injunction. And Cecillia Wang, a lawyer for the ACLU -- which along with other civil rights groups filed one of six other lawsuits against Arizona -- said the judge had stopped "key egregious portions of the law."
"This is an enormous victory for civil liberties in Arizona," she said.
Hannah August, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said lawyers believe the court "ruled correctly" and added: "This administration takes its responsibility to secure our borders seriously and has dedicated unprecedented resources to that effort."
Her message was echoed at the Department of Homeland Security, where spokesman Matt Chandler vowed to increase resources in Arizona, with about 500 National Guard troops set to arrive Sunday along with hundreds of additional U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
The White House has sought to remain at arm's length from the Arizona case, despite President Obama's public statements against the law. The president did not mention the ruling in remarks Wednesday afternoon.
But the White House recognizes the power of the immigration debate in elections this fall as Republicans use anger over border crossings to energize conservative turnout. Senior Democrats have said they are hoping that anti-immigration sentiment drives Latino voters to the Democratic Party in 2012 and beyond.
In her 36-page ruling, Bolton indicated that she understands why Arizona passed the law, which Brewer signed in April. "The Court by no means disregards Arizona's interests in controlling illegal immigration," the judge wrote. But she accepted the administration's arguments that sections of the law target immigrants, impose a burden on federal law enforcement and are "preempted" by federal law.
The expected increase in requests for immigration status checks by Arizona authorities would "divert resources from the federal government's other responsibilities and priorities," wrote Bolton, who allowed other portions of the law to stand, including requiring police to work with federal officials in enforcing immigration laws.

Full text: In Arizona on Wednesday, police chiefs shifted plans, activists recalibrated and public tensions were generally elevated, rather than calmed, after a federal judge blocked key parts of the state's controversial immigration law from taking effect.
"We welcome it, but it's not a full victory," Pablo Alvarado, executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said from Phoenix of theruling. "The conditions that gave birth to [the law] are still on the table. This ruling does not address the hatred. Tensions will continue to rise, and some folks will be more angry now."
U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton's ruling blocked the provision that had prompted the greatest outcry -- on that would require officers to check the immigration status of anyone they lawfully stop or arrest if the officer develops "reasonable suspicion" that the person is an illegal immigrant. Many, especially Hispanics, interpreted that as authorizing the harassment of anyone with brown skin.
Other parts of the law will take effect as scheduled Thursday. Alvarado said his group and others would go forward with modified plans to protest them, especially a section that bars people from soliciting work or hiring if it impedes traffic, a provision he said targets day laborers.
Likewise, groups that had backed the law said they would go ahead with rallies aimed at supporting their champion, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He has made a name for himself over the years by conducting -- and marketing -- immigration raids of the sort that some had hoped would become the norm in Arizona.
Less than an hour after Bolton issued her ruling, his sympathizers provided a glimpse of how they would cast the ruling.
"The president of the United States and this judge just took the side of illegal immigrants against the American citizenry," said William Gheen, president of the Americans for Legal Immigration political action committee. "America is going to cry out in anger. Our mission is to channel that anger into political activities designed to rebuke the politicians and business leaders and special interest groups behind this invasion."
Perhaps the only full sigh of relief was breathed by police chiefs around the state, many of whom do not share Arpaio's zealousness. Almost from the start, they had sought to temper the heated rhetoric with some broader realities: Illegal immigration in Arizona is down, as is crime, which is no more associated with illegal immigrants than any other subset of the population. Many never expected the law to result in mass arrests or deportations, as activists on both sides had predicted, but mostly to instill fear.
The chiefs also had questions about how to implement the law. Among them: whether its requirements would interfere with regular police duties, how or whether it would apply to minors, where and how long people would be held while their status was checked, and how much the new mandate would cost, especially at a time when municipal budgets are strapped. Legal advisers provided an array of answers to those questions.
Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor, who filed a declaration in support of a federal challenge of the law, said he was pleased that Bolton recognized the legislation's "problematic" parts.
Now, he said, he is mostly worried about the reactions to the ruling, and what some have described as an air of vigilantism growing stronger in Arizona, a state that is worse off economically than almost any in the country, where guns are so common that some people wear them to the grocery store.
"When people feel so strongly on both sides," he said, "there is always potential for problems."

Full text: A judge blocked key parts of Arizona's tough new immigration law Wednesday, just hours before it was to take effect.
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said the state will appeal to reinstate the provisions blocked by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton. "This fight is far from over," Brewer said, adding that "Arizona will prevail in its right to protect our citizens."
The state legislature passed the law in a bid to control illegal immigration into Arizona. The ruling halts implementation of parts of the law that require police to determine the immigration status of people they stop and suspect of being in the U.S. illegally.
In Chicago, groups that back immigrant rights rejoiced over the ruling and pledged to rally Thursday at City Hall.

Full text: -- A federal judge on Wednesday blocked most of a controversial Arizona immigration law just hours before it was to take effect, handing the Obama administration a win in the first stage of a legal battle expected to end up in the U.S. Supreme Court.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton issued a temporary injunction against parts of the state law that would require police to determine the status of people they stopped and suspected were in the country illegally.
Bolton also forbade Arizona from making it a crime to not have immigration documents and struck down two other provisions as an unconstitutional effort by Arizona to undermine the federal government's efforts to enforce immigration policy.
In her 36-page decision, Bolton wrote that the provisions would have inevitably "swept up" legal immigrants and were "preempted" by the federal government's immigration authority.
"The court by no means disregards Arizona's interests in controlling illegal immigration and addressing the concurrent problems with crime," she wrote. But, she added, "it is not in the public interest for Arizona to enforce preempted laws."
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vowed a swift appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
"We would have liked to have seen it all upheld, but a temporary injunction is not the end of it," she said with a smile after an appearance in Tucson. "I look at this as a little bump in the road."
Immigrant rights advocates, who had been gearing up for protests after the law took effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, were ebullient.
"It's a victory for the community," said Lydia Guzman, president of Somos America, or We Are America. "It means justice will truly prevail."
Bolton's decision came as little surprise to many legal experts, who had predicted that the law, SB 1070, would be halted because it appeared to contradict U.S. Supreme Court precedent. Brewer signed the measure April 23, saying it was needed to protect Arizona from violence and lawlessness associated with illegal immigrants entering the country from Mexico.
Half of all people stopped for entering the United States illegally are detained on Arizona's southern border.
Civil rights groups and then the Obama administration sued, arguing that the measure would lead to racial profiling and interfere with the federal government's ability to regulate immigration.
Many of the parts of the statute that Bolton, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, allowed to go into effect Thursday are largely technical.
But she found that the federal government was likely to prevail in trial in its arguments against the other provisions, making it likely that her temporary order eventually will become permanent, according to Andy Hessick, an associate professor of law at Arizona State University.
The law's author, state Sen. Russell Pearce, predicted in a television interview that the measure would be upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote. But Gabriel "Jack" Chin, a law professor at the University of Arizona, said the issue may not break down in a partisan manner in the judiciary.
"I think they're going to hesitate to say the United States wants to let a person in because he might be able to give us information, but the state of Arizona can arrest him," he said. "For those saying, 'Wait till the conservative wing of the Supreme Court gets their hands on this,' I'm not so sure."
The Supreme Court already will consider another Arizona law this fall. That law dissolves any business that repeatedly and knowingly hires illegal immigrants. The court may signal its view of SB 1070 in that decision.

Full text: Mabel Bink's family never wanted her cremated in the first place.
Now her remains are missing -- lost in shipment somewhere between Phoenix and Chicago -- and her relatives fear she'll never have a proper burial.
"It's like it's in limbo," said her granddaughter, Beth Biancalana, 42, of Barrington. "I feel like I've had no closure in all of this."
Bink, 89, a native of Chicago's Roseland neighborhood, was living in Mesa, Ariz., when she died June 18 of congestive heart failure. A package containing her ashes was supposed to arrive July 19 in Chicago, in time for her scheduled July 23 burial.
A U.S. Postal Service official said records show the remains were processed in Phoenix and supposedly arrived at O'Hare International Airport on a commercial flight earlier this month. But there's been no sign of the package.
"Everybody is still on high alert for it," said Regina Armstrong, of the U.S. Postal Service's local Consumer Affairs Office. "My heart goes out to the family. I wish they could have some closure."
Armstrong said officials with the Postal Service's Consumer Affairs Office in Phoenix also are "on alert" for the remains. She said an urn had been recovered in Des Moines, but it was the wrong one.
Biancalana said she and her relatives didn't really want Bink cremated to begin with, but Bink, before her death, had insisted on it because shipping her body back to Chicago would be too costly. Biancalana's uncle, Kenneth Bink, 62, who lives in the Phoenix area, planned to carry the cremated remains when he flew back to Chicago for the burial and memorial. He even bought a special permit to allow him to do so.
Another shipping fiasco altered his plans. The family had also ordered a vault in which the ashes would be placed for burial, but the vault was accidentally shipped to Phoenix instead of Chicago. Kenneth Bink couldn't carry the vault and the cremated remains because of their size, so he decided to have everything shipped.
Family members said the U.S. Postal Service was the only option: FedEx and UPS don't permit shipments of cremated remains.
"That's just a very special thing to all of us, so we decided that's just one of the things we don't handle," said Sally Davenport, FedEx spokeswoman.
The 2-foot-by-2-foot, 20-pound package also includes a family heirloom -- a locket Biancalana's grandfather gave her grandmother when they were courting.
Though the family couldn't bury Mabel Bink without her remains, they decided to carry out an already-scheduled memorial service Saturday in South Holland.
But the weekend's torrential downpour, which flooded many highways and side streets, prevented Biancalana and some other relatives from attending. She said she drove for about three hours, trying several different routes, all of which were blocked by water.
"It's been surreal," she said.
She considers her grandmother "like a third parent." The two lived together until Biancalana was in her 20s.
The daughter of Dutch immigrants, Mabel Bink graduated from Fenger High School in 1939 and worked at Argonne National Laboratory as a payroll clerk, where her family estimates she processed $800 million in payroll checks.
She also was a talented seamstress who kept up with fashion trends, and even made all of Biancalana's clothing when she was a child and in college.
Biancalana said some of her relatives have contacted attorneys but haven't taken any legal action.
She said everyone is holding out hope that the remains will be recovered so Bink can be laid to rest.

Full text: A federal judge's rejection of the most controversial elements of Arizona's immigration law is unlikely to change the entrenched calculus of immigration politics in Washington, where not a single Republican senator supports the overhaul that many experts say is needed to fix what President Barack Obama calls a "fundamentally broken" system.
The contours of the problem are no mystery: There are as many as 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States, and more are drawn every day by untold numbers of jobs -- from dishwasher to strawberry picker -- that Americans find unattractive. Deporting them all is impossible, and without a tamper-proof national ID card, there is no sure way to prevent businesses from hiring them.
There also is little hope of rendering a 2,000-mile border with Mexico impenetrable to illicit crossers as long as there is economic opportunity on the U.S. side.
To upend this troubled reality, the Obama administration, like the Bush administration before it, has proposed "comprehensive immigration reform" that seeks a grand compromise: Combine tough border and workplace enforcement with a process to legalize the 11 million.
The Senate sponsor, Democrat Charles Schumer of New York, also has proposed a national biometric identification card intended to make it difficult to hire illegal immigrants, and a guest worker program to allow low-skilled workers to enter the U.S. temporarily and legally.
Republicans, even those who backed George W. Bush's failed effort in 2007, have been unwilling to support the measure, meaning it can't pass the Senate's 60-vote threshold.
They respond with a mantra: Secure the border first. There can be no talk of "amnesty," they say, until the flow of illegal immigrants is stanched.
That is not realistic, say Democrats and many independent experts. If the U.S. military couldn't secure the borders of Iraq from jihadists crossing from Syria and Iran to kill American soldiers, they say, it is unlikely that the Border Patrol, or the National Guard, can stop every hungry worker or kilo of cocaine moving out of Mexico.
"Unless and until Washington steps up and enacts a coherent, comprehensive and national immigration policy, we will continue to see this debate roil local and state politics from coast to coast," said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, an immigration rights group. "It can only be solved by Congress and the administration. Comprehensive immigration reform that combines targeted enforcement with a legal work force is what the American people want."
Yet many Americans reject that premise.
They believe what's needed is tougher enforcement, period, and they argue that the federal government simply lacks the will.
"Instead of wasting taxpayer resources filing a lawsuit against Arizona and complaining that the law would be burdensome, the Obama administration should have focused its efforts on working with Congress to provide the necessary resources to support the state in its efforts to act where the federal government has failed to take responsibility," said Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who once supported an immigration overhaul but now, facing a tough challenge in the Republican primary, backs the law in his home state.
Recognizing the desire for tougher enforcement, Obama has ordered 1,200 National Guard troops to be deployed along the U.S.-Mexican border starting in August.
The administration also is on track to deport 400,000 illegal immigrants this year, the most in U.S. history. Authorities say their top priority is to remove criminals and those who have been previously deported.
"Over the past 18 months, this administration has dedicated unprecedented resources to secure the border," Department of Homeland Security spokesman Matt Chandler said in a statement responding to Wednesday's court decision.
"DHS will enforce federal immigration laws in Arizona and around the country in smart, effective ways that focus our resources on criminal aliens who pose a public safety threat and employers who knowingly hire illegal labor, as well as continue to secure our border," Chandler said.
The GOP sees it differently. But both sides agree on the state of play: political gridlock.
"Nothing's going to happen before the election," said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., though he held out hope for some action in a lame-duck, postelection legislative session.
"In this atmosphere I don't see anything going anywhere," said Arizona Republican Rep. Jeff Flake.
- - -
Next step
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will consider whether to reverse the injunction on parts of Arizona's immigration law. That decision can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Regardless of the outcome, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton will hear a trial on the state's law and decide whether to make her injunction permanent or lift it. That ruling can be appealed to the 9th Circuit, and then the U.S. Supreme Court. The process could take several years.

WASHINGTON--On the eve of a long-awaited vote in Congress on Thursday on a bill to provide health care for sick Ground Zero workers, Republicans and Democrats lashed out at each other over what is expected to be a losing cause.
More than eight years after the 9/11 attacks, the effort to provide long-term treatment for thousands who became ill after working at the World Trade Center site is on the verge of failing in the House due to a bitter argument over immigration, health care and the coming election.
Even before the vote, Democrats faulted Republicans for opposing the bill because it pays for the program by re-applying a tax on foreign-registered firms with U.S. operations. The GOP called that a tax hike; Democrats said the move closes a tax loophole, and suggested those who oppose the bill are putting corporate wealth ahead of sick first responders.
"There is a choice here: Either support the bill and the victims of 9/11 or oppose it because of foreign corporate interests trying to avoid taxes here in the United States,'' said Rep. Joseph Crowley, a Queens Democrat, who said he's frustrated that no one on the Republican side seems willing to negotiate a solution to the impasse.
That infuriated Long Island Republican Rep. Peter King, who supports the bill but called the Democratic majority's handling of the issue "total moral cowardice.''
"The Democrats are afraid of a tough vote, and they'd rather let cops and firefighters die," said Mr. King, who added that New York Democrats are covering for the timidity of their party leaders.
Democratic congressman Michael McMahon of Staten Island responded to Mr. King's comments: "I'm not quite sure what he's squealing about....If he can't deliver the votes then he shouldn't be pointing fingers.''
About a dozen or so Republicans are expected to support the measure.
Late Wednesday evening. Mssrs. Crowley, McMahon, and six other New York Democrats sent Mr. King a letter saying two-thirds of Democrats had agreed to support the bill, and asking how many of the Republicans have agreed to vote yes. The back-and-forth is noteworthy because it has been rare for members of the New York delegation to take jabs at each other on the issue of Sept. 11-related programs.
Democrats had planned a vote on the program Wednesday, but pushed it back a day as they tried desperately to muster enough votes. But passage doesn't look likely, particularly since they have decided to use a procedure called suspension to avoid amendments on immigration and health care being attached to the bill.
Under suspension, a measure needs a two-thirds majority to pass, and on Wednesday neither side believed the bill had enough support.
Democrats chose that route because they feared a traditional floor vote would lead to an amendment explicitly barring any illegal immigrants from receiving care under the program. Another fear for the Democrats is that Republicans would offer an amendment undercutting the major health-care overhaul bill that passed earlier this year.
The 9/11 bill in question would spend $7.4 billion over 10 years to provide treatment to those sickened after exposure to Ground Zero, and re-open a compensation fund.
Facing another setback, some Ground Zero worker groups are already furious at Congress, suggesting there will be more protests on the issue.
Supporters of the bill say if it does fail Thursday, they will try to revive it in two months, in the hopes that forcing public votes on the issue will eventually pressure enough lawmakers to support the legislation.

Berlusconi Is No Mobster; Italy's prime minister has overseen the toughest crackdown on the mob in decades.

Abstract: The 41-bis regime was introduced in 1992 as a temporary measure designed to help cope with a national emergency. [...] being in prison for the mafia bosses could be likened to staying in a hotel, from where they could continue to order killings and room-service. According to the Italian business association Confesercenti, the business of "Mafia, Inc." had revenue of [euro]135 billion in 2009, reinforcing its position as the "first company of Italy."

Rome
Rumors have circulated for years about a kind of pact between the mafia and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, which guarantees him electoral support in the mob-controlled regions of southern Italy. And yet Mr. Berlusconi's government, now in its third term, has been conducting an impressive and extensive campaign against the mob. A recent string of successes includes the rolling up of hundreds of members of the 'Ndrangheta crime family. Not since the days of anti-mafia hero and magistrate Giovanni Falcone has the mob had it so tough.
Mr. Berlusconi has always dismissed the claims that he is linked to the mafia as "vile" nonsense. Those who are in the business of fighting the mafia know that the state has taken important steps toward its eradication: The most recent police operations and colossal seizures of mafia goods have delivered deadly blows. But, despite the facts, the chattering classes continue to generate an image of Mr. Berlusconi as a dangerous gangster.
On Dec. 31, 2009, Interior Minister Roberto Maroni declared "total war" against the mafia. Since then an average of eight criminals have been arrested every day. Some say a government initiative will only ever be able to deliver temporary setbacks to the mafia. Arresting a few gangsters is like cutting the head off a Hydra: Others will simply take their place. But a rogue's gallery of 21 out of Italy's 30 most-wanted gangsters have been arrested, among them convicted multiple-murderers who had been on the run for years.
Those arrested have included most of the remaining leaders of the Casalesi clan exposed in Roberto Saviano's notorious book "Gomorrah." The mobster Giuseppe Bastone was captured in a subterranean hideout. The No. 2 leader of Sicily's mafia, Domenico Raccuglia, who was nicknamed "the veterinarian" for his love of animals, was captured in 2009 after 15 years on the run. (He was subsequently condemned to life in jail for homicide, after dumping the teenage son of a mafia turncoat in acid.)
Last year, detectives also arrested 70 suspected members of the Casalesi, including the fugitive, Franco Letizia. And, in a pre-dawn raid on July 13, Italian police arrested another 300 members of the 'Ndrangheta mafia syndicate, including the man police have dubbed "godfather," Domenico Oppedisano. This is the largest crackdown on organized crime in the past 20 years. "If there is a government that, more than any other, has made fighting the mafia one of its clearest and coherent goals, it is my government," Mr. Berlusconi claims. He is never a humble speaker, but in this case the facts do indisputably back him up.
Mr. Berlusconi has also extended a controversial prison system for mafia members. Known as "41-bis," it enables the state to lock up dangerous bosses in maximum-security jails and complete isolation. The 41-bis regime was introduced in 1992 as a temporary measure designed to help cope with a national emergency. Until then, being in prison for the mafia bosses could be likened to staying in a hotel, from where they could continue to order killings and room-service. Now they live in small and dim cells, entirely cut off from the outside world. In 2002, Mr. Berlusconi made the measure a permanent fixture: "People have the right to not be afraid," he said.
The system is seen as so harsh that in 2007 a Los Angeles immigration court denied an extradition request from Italy for the gangster Rosario Gambino on the grounds that the 41-bis system was "inhumane" and "constitutes torture." The human-rights group Amnesty International has defined the 41-bis regime as "cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment" for prisoners. A quite peculiar tool for a prime minister labeled as "friend of mobsters."
The Italian government has also made efforts to take on the mafia where it is arguably at its strongest--in its financial control. Italian crime groups have transformed themselves into global financial enterprises. The four distinct mafia "families"--Sicily's Cosa Nostra, the Camorra from Campania, the 'Ndragheta of Calabria and the lesser known Sacra Corona Unita in Puglia--dominate the economic life of one third of Italy. According to the Italian business association Confesercenti, the business of "Mafia, Inc." had revenue of [euro]135 billion in 2009, reinforcing its position as the "first company of Italy." Italy's Eurispes Institute estimated that the 'Ndrangheta's turnover alone amounts to the equivalent of 2.9% of Italy's GDP.
Under Mr. Berlusconi, the dispossession of mafia funds has risen by 89% compared to the previous government. Police recently seized assets totaling some [euro]1.4 billion just from the businessmen linked to Matteo Messina Denaro, who took over command of the Sicilian mob in the wake of the 2006 arrest of the "boss of bosses," Bernardo Provenzano. In total, [euro]3.5 billion was seized in 2007, [euro]4.5 billion in 2008 and [euro]5.4 billion in 2009.
The seized money goes into a new fund called the Justice Fund, a tool that has been praised world-wide, from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to Israeli Minister of Justice Yaakov Neeman. The fund works to make the procedure of dispossession quicker and less bureaucratic, and the seized money is invested back into the repression on the mob. The mafia's funds are used in the battle against the mafia itself.
The battle that has played out in Sicily over the last 50 years shows that if the Italian state takes on the mafia with tenacity and seriousness, it can win. If we are to judge the Italian tragedy that is the history of the mafia by the facts, then Mr. Berlusconi is probably the greatest persecutor of the mob, in all its incarnations, in a long time. That's true even if he continues to joke about his mafia links: "Our interior minister is working well," he said recently, "but he has yet to capture me as a mobster."

Full text: Author: James Taranto
The General Court of Massachusetts "on Tuesday approved a bill that would give the state's Electoral College votes for president to the winner of the national popular vote," reports. Last week we at the expense of this legislation, which Gov. Deval Patrick is expected to sign.
But we thought it worth taking a serious look at the effort--for while it is ridiculous, that is not the worst that can be said about it. It is a partisan protest masquerading as a high-minded reform. It is a too-clever-by-half attempt to circumvent America's constitutional structure. Its constitutional infirmity raises the prospect of future political crises worse than the 2000 election dispute.
Assuming that the Massachusetts bill becomes a law, it would not necessarily mean that, say, Sarah Palin will carry Massachusetts if she gets 50.1% of the nationwide popular vote in 2012. That would require action by other states. As Politico notes:
The law would only take effect in the unlikely event that enough other states approved similar legislation to account for the 270 electoral votes needed to win.
The idea is known as the . If and only if enough states have joined by July20 of any presidential election year, those states affirm that their election officials will choose the slate of electors pledged to the candidate with the highest national popular-vote total, regardless of the preferences of their own states' voters.
In other words, it takes effect only if enough states have joined to ensure that the result will be to hand the presidency to the popular-vote "winner." It's clever because it avoids the need for a constitutional amendment, which requires a two-thirds vote in Congress and approval of 38 (3 of 4) state legislatures. The NPVIC, by contrast, could in theory be imposed by as few as 11 states (the most populous have a combined 271 electoral votes under the current apportionment) over the objections of the other 39.
It's not large states that are rushing to sign up for the NPVIC, though, as Politico notes:
So far, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, Washington and Hawaii have passed such legislation. If Massachusetts's Democratic governor, Deval Patrick, wre [sic] to sign the bill, it would bring the total of electoral votes potentially determined by this method to 73.
The common thread tying these states together is political party. In all of them, as well as in Massachusetts, the bill passed at a time when Democrats had complete control of the legislative process. (New Jersey had a Democratic governor at the time it joined the compact; and Democrats in the Hawaii Legislature hold a veto-proof majority, which they had to use to override the objections of Gov. Linda Lingle, a Republican.)
The National Popular Vote website reports that in three other states-- , and --the legislation was approved by lawmakers in both houses only to be vetoed by the governor. All three states have Republican governors and Democratic majorities in both houses.
What is more, all of the nine states where the legislation has reached the governor's desk have voted Democratic in all of the past five presidential elections (the past six elections in the cases of Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Washington), and usually by double-digit margins.
It's no mystery why this idea appeals to Democrats. They are still bitter over the disputed 2000 presidential election, in which Al Gore "won" the popular vote but George W. Bush won the actual election. Changing the rules wouldn't necessarily benefit Democrats, but you can see why trying to do so might make them feel good.
The NPVIC, however, cannot be instituted without the support of at least some states Bush won in 2000. The Gore states (plus the District of Columbia) had just 267 votes then and are down to 260 in the current apportionment. This number is likely to decline further as a result of reapportionment after the 2010 census, as suggested by an study:
Seven states--Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah and Washington--would each gain a seat and Texas would gain three seats if the U.S. House of Representatives were reapportioned with census population estimates for July 1, 2009, according to Election Data Services' analysis. Eight states would lose single seats--Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, while the state of Ohio now stands to lose two seats.
Gore states would gain one vote and lose seven, for a net loss of six, leaving them with 254, or 16 short of a majority. The actual apportionment will look different from these estimates, and the bottom line may be greater or smaller than minus-six, but the overall patterns of population growth make it inevitable that the Gore states' electoral strength will have eroded by 2012.
That means that in order to make the NPVIC a reality, its proponents would have to convince lawmakers in states whose voters benefited from the Electoral College in 2000 by seeing the man they favored become president. To say the least, this will be a harder sell in Texas or Georgia--or, for that matter, in Florida--than in Massachusetts and Illinois.
To be sure, it is an accident of history that this is a Democratic measure. Before the 2000 election, some pundits speculated that the opposite outcome might obtain: that Bush might outpoll Gore while losing the election. Had that happened, Republicans might today be pushing for the popular vote and Democrats defending the traditional role of states.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and it's possible that going to a popular vote would benefit the Republicans in a future election. Thus to a considerable extent both Democratic support and Republican opposition to the NPVIC are irrational, a case of generals fighting the last war.
Yet the NPVIC is a terrible idea even if electing the president by popular vote is a good one. This is because of a constitutional infirmity that its backers have failed to anticipate.
NationalPopularVote.com features a page called " " that includes the following argument debunking the assertion that the NPVIC would be unconstitutional (omitting footnotes and added emphases):
A successful challenge to the National Popular Vote compact on constitutional grounds is unlikely, given the fact that constitutional law concerning interstate compacts is well settled and given the fact that the National Popular Vote compact is based on the exclusive and plenary (i.e., complete) power of the states to award their electoral votes as they see fit.
First, the U.S. Constitution says:
"Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors...."
The wording "as the Legislature ... may direct" in the Constitution is an unqualified grant of plenary and exclusive power to the states. This constitutional provision does not encourage, discourage, require, or prohibit the use of any particular method for awarding a state's electoral votes. States may exercise this grant of power in any way they see fit, provided only that they do not violate other specific provisions of the Constitution. As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in the 1892 case of McPherson v. Blacker:
"The constitution does not provide that the appointment of electors shall be by popular vote, nor that the electors shall be voted for upon a general ticket, nor that the majority of those who exercise the elective franchise can alone choose the electors. It recognizes that the people act through their representatives in the legislature, and leaves it to the legislature exclusively to define the method of effecting the object. The framers of the constitution employed words in their natural sense; and, where they are plain and clear, resort to collateral aids to interpretation is unnecessary, and cannot be indulged in to narrow or enlarge the text."
The Court continued:
"In short, the appointment and mode of appointment of electors belong exclusively to the states under the constitution of the United States"
In Bush v. Gore in 2000, the Court called article II, section 1, clause 2:
"The source for the statement in McPherson v. Blacker ... that the State legislature's power to select the manner for appointing electors is plenary."
In short, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly characterized the authority of the states over the manner of awarding their electoral votes as "plenary" and "exclusive."
Color us convinced. The Constitution does not limit state legislatures' power to choose the method of selecting electors. Therefore, the NPVIC is not unconstitutional.
It is unenforceable.
Think about that old Philosophy 101 question: If God is omnipotent, can he make a rock so big that he can't lift it? It seems like a puzzle, but the answer is clearly no. The premise that God is omnipotent leads to the conclusion that he can both make and lift a rock of any size. "A rock so big that he can't lift it" is a logically incoherent construct, not a limitation on God's power.
The NPVIC is based on the similarly illogical premise that lawmakers with plenary powers can enact a law so strong that they can't repeal it. In truth, because a state legislature's power in this matter is plenary, it would be an entirely legitimate exercise of its authority to drop out of the compact anytime before the deadline for selecting electors--be it July21 of an election year or Nov.9.
Call it the problem of faithless lawmakers--somewhat akin to the question of faithless electors. Legal scholars differ on whether state laws requiring electors to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged are constitutional. But because the power of legislatures to choose the method of selecting electors is plenary, there is no question that the Constitution would permit faithless lawmakers to exit the NPVIC.
If one or more states did so, and it affected the outcome of the election, the result would be a political crisis that would make 2000 look tame. Unlike in that case, the Supreme Court would be unable to review the matter because it would be an exercise in plenary lawmaking authority. Challenges in Congress to the electoral vote count would be almost inevitable. Whatever the outcome, it would result from an assertion of raw political power that the losing side would have good reason to see as illegitimate.
The NPVIC could make such a crisis even out of an undisputed election. In 1888, Grover Cleveland lost his bid for a second consecutive term despite outpolling Benjamin Harrison nationally. But there was no Florida in 1888; the outcome in every state was unquestioned. If the NPVIC were in effect, Cleveland would have won--unless a Harrison state, exercising its plenary power, ditched the compact and selected the Harrison electors instead. Then, chaos.
Since the NPVIC would be legally unenforceable, only political pressure could be brought to bear to ensure that state legislatures stand by their commitments to it. Would this be enough? Let's put the question in starkly partisan terms: If you're a Republican, do you trust Massachusetts lawmakers to keep their word, and to defy the will of the voters who elected them, if by doing so they would make Sarah Palin president?
Among those implicated in the Journolist scandal, Time magazine's Joe Klein is perhaps the most eminent. (Admittedly, that's a low standard.) A reader calls our attention to a Klein post from Time.com taking issue with a Wall Street Journal op-ed in which , who have both worked as pollsters in Democratic administrations, criticized President Obama as divisive.
Klein describes Caddell and Schoen as "disgorging an incendiary argument." It seems to us that "vomiting fire" would be a wittier and more vivid way of putting it. He "wonders why Caddell and Schoen have taken this cheesy route." Sorry, Joe, making sense out of "cheesy route" is beyond even our capability as a writer. He also speculates about their motives: "The words 'free' and 'publicity' come to mind."
But what about the merits of their argument? Klein makes a pretense of addressing them. But watch how he does it:
One reason [Obama] is divisive, they say, is that he supports immigration reform. George W. Bush supported immigration reform. The Wall Street Journal editorial page has supported immigration reform. Plenty of enlightened Republicans do--for moral reasons and, in the case of the Journal, for valid economic reasons. But Obama supports it--they aver, with zero evidence--solely for political reasons. He wants to gin up the Latino vote. One wonders--and I know I'm going out on a real limb here--if it is possible that the President supports immigration reform because it is the right thing to do. Caddell and Schoen don't even mention the possibility.
Now here is what Caddell and Schoen actually wrote:
Sen. Jon Kyl (R.,Ariz.) has said the president told him in a closed-door meeting that he would not move to secure the border with Mexico unless and until Congress reached a breakthrough on comprehensive immigration reform. That's another indication Mr. Obama is willing to continue to play politics with hot-button issues.
Klein's claim that Caddell and Schoen consider Obama divisive because "he supports immigration reform" is a falsehood of near- proportions. In fact, they expressed no opinion on immigration reform and criticized the president only for his political tactics in attempting to bully Congress into enacting it (or, alternatively, in using it as an excuse not to enforce the border).
Now, perhaps the president's tactics and policies are justifiable, or his motives are pure (or at least mixed), or Caddell and Schoen (or Kyl) has some aspect of the story wrong. But that's not what Klein argues. He claims, instead, that Caddell and Schoen are being unfair to the president, possibly with foul intentions--based on something they did not write.
Oh well, that's journolistic ethics for you!
Jon Stewart of "The Daily Show" weighed in earlier this week on the Shirley Sherrod fiasco. Mediaite.com has a transcript, along with video at the bottom of the page. Here's what Stewart said (we've cleaned up typos and punctuation in the Mediaite transcript):
Stewart: First of all, Fox News is too busy with their Black Panther hard-on to bother much with this. And Andrew Breitbart, the guy who leaked [sic] the edited tape, may be the most honest person in this entire story. This is what he said five months ago:
Bretibart (from file footage): I want to be in the history books saying I took down the institutional left.
Stewart: See, he didn't say, "I want to be in the history books a a paragon of honesty"; he didn't say "I would like to be in the Museum of Broadcasting, and to be known by children around the world as Arnold B. Truthington of Accuracy Lane."
No, he said out loud, "I want to bring down the institutional left." So if you are on the institutional left, and you see the package from him, watch the whole [bleep] tape. How is that snookering?
Mediaite calls this "a rather brave point." While we certainly agree it's an excellent one, we're not prepared to take credit for bravery.
The final sentence of our final item yesterday should have read, "Maybe he can and throw them at himself." We regret the error.

Neil Irwin of the Washington Post's business section asks the question on everybody's mind:
The U.S. economy is out of the ditch. But is there enough gas left in the engine to reach highway speed?
Here's Irwin's answer:
The recovery faces a crucial test over the next couple of months: Either it will pick up vital momentum from increased consumer spending and investment or stall out, dipping into a period of anemic growth--or perhaps even another recession.
All that insight just in the first two paragraphs! It's this kind of prescient, penetrating analysis that makes the Post's business section "the essential source for business and economic policy news."

Full text: A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the most controversial elements of Arizona's new immigration law, thrilling the law's opponents, dismaying its advocates and setting the stage for more legal battles in the future.
"We would have liked to have seen it all upheld, but a temporary injunction is not the end of it," said Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed the legislation in April.
The governor said she was looking forward to getting started on the appeals process. "Jan Brewer is not a quitter," she said.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton halted implementation of the parts of the law that require police to determine the immigration status of people they stop and think are in the country illegally. She also forbade the state from charging anyone with failure to possess immigration documents, a crime under the new law.
In her 36-page decision, Bolton wrote that the measure would have hamstrung the federal government's efforts to enforce immigration law.
"The federal government's ability to enforce its policies and achieve its objectives will be undermined by the state's enforcement of statutes that interfere with federal law," she wrote.
The law's supporters, who contended it was needed to stop illegal immigrants from coming to Arizona, vowed a swift appeal.
Brewer, speaking with reporters as she left the University of Arizona technology park, said she believes the law is constitutional. Brewer also said, as she has repeatedly in the past, that the law was an attempt to protect the state.
"I wish that the federal government would step up and do their job so we could all be safe and secure in the state of Arizona," she said.
Immigrant-rights groups were ebullient. "It means justice will truly prevail," said Lydia Guzman, president of Somos America, or We Are America.
"It is racist, elitist and unjustified," Baldomero Carranza, 27, of Chicago, said of the law. "It is a reactionary law in a global world."
Phoenix Vice Mayor Michael Nowakowski, an opponent of the measure, told reporters outside the courthouse that the ruling was "a victory for individuals who say the federal law is the federal law."
Bolton's ruling found that the Obama administration was likely to prevail at trial in proving that the provisions requiring police to determine immigration status and immigrants to carry documents, along with two other provisions of the sweeping law, were an unconstitutional attempt by Arizona to regulate immigration. Arizona is expected to immediately appeal the decision to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
As the clock ticked down toward the implementation of the law known as SB 1070, tensions had been rising as both sides braced for confrontations in the streets and waited to see how -- and if -- the judge would rule before the law was to take effect Thursday.
Busloads of demonstrators were arriving from L.A. and were expected to join large numbers of locals protesting the measure Thursday morning. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- whose campaign against illegal immigrants has made him a widely popular, if controversial, figure here -- had said he would open a new section of his outdoor tent jail that he is dubbing "Section 1070," where he intended to house illegal immigrants detained as a result of the law.
Arpaio, whose high-rise offices in downtown Phoenix were to be targeted by demonstrators Thursday, released a statement before Bolton's ruling warning that he would not tolerate lawbreakers.
"Activists and their celebrity sympathizers who wish to target this community and this sheriff by attempting to disrupt our jail and patrol operations will be unsuccessful, as we will be fully prepared to meet those challenges head-on with appropriately staffed personnel and resources," he said.

HOW DO ARIZONANS FEEL?
Polls have shown that Arizonans overwhelmingly support SB 1070. That was the view expressed by Faye Yanez, 65, as she and husband were leaving a Home Depot in Tucson, Ariz. Yanez said she was disappointed by the ruling.
"We feel slighted," she said. "The state should have a right to take care of the state because the federal government isn't doing anything."
Yanez, a schoolteacher, said the cost of health care and education are higher than they should be because of illegal immigrants in Arizona. "I have nothing against them getting health care or education, but have someone sponsor them," she said.
Susie Baker, 53, who remodels homes in Tucson, felt differently.
"I am thrilled," she said, as she headed into the store to return some items. "I think Jan Brewer is out of her mind. She is bringing harm to Arizona."

Full text: Washington According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation national survey, the vast majority believe that most immigrants are basically good, honest people who are hard-working. However, nearly seven in ten say that immigrants are a burden on the taxpayer, 62 percent think they add to the crime problem, and 59 percent believe they take jobs away from Americans.
The poll, released Wednesday, asks about all people who have immigrated to other countries in the past 10 years, and not just about illegal immigrants in the U.S.
"The results may explain why most Americans think that the policies that made the U.S. a 'melting pot' strengthened the country a century ago but do not make the country stronger today," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.
Taking the "melting pot" metaphor a bit further, do Americans think that immigrants should maintain their own culture, or blend into the existing culture in this country?
"Two-thirds of whites say that immigrants should give up some important aspects of their culture to blend in; only about four in 10 Hispanics, and an equal number of blacks, agree with that view," Holland said.
And what about the "American dream" that attracts so many immigrants to this country?
According to the survey, 45 percent of whites say they have achieved the American dream, compared to 38 percent of Hispanics and only 23 percent of blacks. Roughly one in five of each racial group says they will never achieve the American dream.
The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted July 16-21, with 1,018 adult Americans questioned by telephone, including a special sample of 308 black and 303 Hispanic respondents. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.

The immigration debate is reviving the explosive idea of denying citizenship to children born on U.S. soil if their parents are in the country illegally.
A U.S. senator and a state lawmaker in Arizona, both central players in the battle over immigration law, separately proposed this week that "birthright" citizenship be denied to the children of illegal immigrants. They said the change would help stem the flood of illegal border crossings.
"People come here to have babies. They come here to drop a child," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said Wednesday night on Fox News. "That shouldn't be the case. That attracts people here for all the wrong reasons." Mr. Graham is a onetime partner with Democrats in crafting a proposed overhaul of immigration laws.
Immigration-rights activists say citizenship isn't a significant driver of illegal immigration, because a child has to reach age 21 to petition for permanent legal residency for his or her parents.
Such calls to change what has been a bedrock feature of the immigration system are sure to set off contentious debate. "It's an extreme position, and Sen. Graham knows this," said Angela Kelley of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. "He's not one to tamper with the Constitution, so I'm surprised he would even suggest this."
In Arizona, Republican state Sen. Russell Pearce, the architect of the immigration law that drew a legal challenge from the Obama administration, said he wanted to deny U.S. citizenship to children born in his state to illegal immigrants.
At issue is the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, enacted in 1868 to ensure that states not deny former slaves the full rights of citizenship. It states: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."
Mr. Graham, speaking on Fox, suggested that changing birthright-citizenship rules would require a constitutional amendment. "We should change our Constitution and say if you come here illegally and have a child, that child's not automatically a citizen," he said.
He said he was considering introducing such an amendment. A spokesman said Thursday that Mr. Graham was just discussing the idea and hadn't made any decisions about whether to move ahead.
Mr. Pearce, like some other proponents of the change, argued that the amendment as written doesn't apply to illegal immigrants. Because illegal immigrants aren't "subject to the jurisdiction" of the U.S., as the amendment requires, they fall outside its protection, these people argue. A group of House lawmakers made a similar argument when they tried to pass legislation changing the birthright principle in 2005.
"When it was ratified in 1868, the amendment had to do with African-Americans; it had nothing to do with aliens," said Mr. Pearce. "It's got to be fixed."
Given the controversial nature of this proposal, successfully amending the Constitution would be considered a long shot. It requires a vote of two-thirds of the House and of the Senate, and must be ratified by three-fourths of state legislators.
A change in state law redefining who is a citizen would likely draw a legal challenge, as did Arizona's effort to change state immigration law.
Under Mr. Pearce's proposal, Arizona would refuse to issue a birth certificate to any child unless at least one parent could prove legal presence in the U.S. "The 14th Amendment has been hijacked and abused," Mr. Pearce said. "We incentivize people to break our laws."
The U.S. is home to about 11 million illegal immigrants. There are nearly four million whose children are U.S. citizens, according to a 2009 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.
Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which calls for cracking down on all immigration to the U.S., said that citizenship as a birthright isn't automatic in many countries in the West.
"We should not allow language from 1868 to enslave our thinking...in the 21st century," Mr. Stein said. "It is defeating the purpose of immigration control."
Mr. Pearce was sponsor of SB1070, the law that required police to check the immigration station of anyone they stop if they suspect unlawful presence. On Wednesday, a federal judge blocked that provision and others, pending further legal review. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed the bill into law, has promised to appeal the injunction.
On Thursday, close to a thousand protestors chanted, drummed and participated in street blockades throughout downtown Phoenix to show their intent to resist SB1070, regardless of the judge's decision to temporarily enjoin the most controversial portions. Many were arrested.
"We don't want no police state! Stop the injustice, stop the hate!" hundreds chanted in front of the office of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who supported the law and whose deputies have made it a priority to detain illegal immigrants.
"Arpaio, listen, we're at war!" others cried in Spanish.
The protestors flooded the streets with their posters and banners, blocking streets. More than 60 police officers sought to control the crowd.

Full text: Author: William P. Cook
Many will see Judge Susan Bolton's decision to block parts of Arizona's new immigration law solely as an affirmation of the federal government's primacy over the states. But a close look at her ruling reveals that she's handed Arizona a significant victory against renegade localities seeking to undercut our nation's immigration laws.
For example, Judge Bolton let stand A.R.S. S 11-1051(A), which prohibits Arizona officials, agencies and political subdivisions from limiting enforcement of federal immigration laws. A.R.S. S 11-1051(C)-(F), which requires that state officials work with federal officials with regard to aliens unlawfully in the state, will also remain in force.
Her ruling--provided it is adopted by other courts across the country--will drive a stake into the heart of the "sanctuary" movement among cities and towns that feel they have the authority to disregard federal law. Right now, they permit illegal aliens to freely reside within their borders and have access to various benefits that should only be reserved for those here lawfully.
Many local governments--mostly vocally San Francisco, but also Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler and Tucson--have conducted themselves as "sanctuaries." As such, they have directed law enforcement personnel within their domains not to cooperate with state or federal law enforcement in the proper handling, including processing for deportation, of illegal immigrants. The court's decision makes it clear that at least in the case of Arizona, localities can no longer delude themselves into thinking this is acceptable.
The court also left unchanged the provision that permits legal residents of Arizona to sue any state official, agency or political subdivision for not enforcing federal immigration laws to the full extent permitted. Such private rights of action in the context of policy issues are unheard of nationally, and may well be the most important component of Arizona's new law. How these suits are implemented, and the impact they'll have on cities and towns that until now have felt free to pursue whatever course they chose without sanction, will be quite interesting to watch.
In addition, Judge Bolton refused to halt the implementation of a variety of amendments to existing Arizona law--those that pertain to the state's right to control employment within its borders by regulating employers:
A.R.S. S 13-2928(A)-(B): creating a crime for stopping a motor vehicle to pick up day laborers and for day laborers to get in a motor vehicle if it impedes the normal movement of traffic;
A.R.S. S 23-212: amending the crime of knowingly employing unauthorized aliens;
A.R.S. S 23-214: amending the requirements for checking employment eligibility.
Several other provisions of Arizona law pertaining to existing criminal violations also go into effect. First, there is an amendment that would make transporting or harboring an illegal alien an additional offense for a person who has committed another crime (A.R.S. S 13-2929). Another amendment, A.R.S. S 28-3511, calls for the removal or impoundment of a vehicle used to transport or harbor aliens in Arizona illegally.
While there may be joy in certain quarters that Arizona's law enforcement personnel cannot be deputized by their state to enforce federal immigration laws, the reality is that Arizona came away with notable victories that should be acknowledged. Now it must summon the political will to implement them.

IMMIGRATION DEBATE; Immigration politics unlikely to change; A comprehensive overhaul lacks any Republican support in the Senate, and therefore cannot pass.

Abstract: "Instead of wasting taxpayer resources filing a lawsuit against Arizona and complaining that the law would be burdensome, the Obama administration should have focused its efforts on working with Congress to provide the necessary resources to support the state in its efforts to act where the federal government has failed to take responsibility," said Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who once supported an immigration policy overhaul but now, facing a tough challenge in the Republican primary, backs the law in his home state.

Full text: A federal judge's rejection of the most controversial elements of Arizona's immigration law is unlikely to change the entrenched immigration politics in Washington, where not a single Republican senator supports the overhaul that many experts say is needed to fix what President Obama calls a "fundamentally broken" system.
The contours of the problem are no mystery: An estimated 11 million illegal immigrants live in the U.S., and more are drawn every day by untold numbers of jobs -- dishwasher, strawberry picker and others -- that Americans find unattractive. Deporting them all is impossible, and without a tamper-proof national ID card, there is no sure way to prevent businesses from hiring them.
There also is little hope of rendering a 2,000-mile border with Mexico impenetrable to illicit crossers as long as there is economic opportunity on the U.S. side.
To upend this troubled reality, the Obama administration, like the Bush administration before it, has proposed "comprehensive immigration reform" that seeks a grand compromise: Combine tough border and workplace enforcement with a process to legalize the 11 million.
The Senate sponsor, Democrat Charles E. Schumer of New York, also has proposed a national biometric ID card intended to make it difficult to hire illegal immigrants, and a guest-worker program to allow low-skilled workers to enter the U.S. temporarily and legally.
Republicans, even those who backed President George W. Bush's failed effort in 2007, have been unwilling to support the measure, meaning it can't pass the Senate's 60-vote threshold. They respond with a mantra: Secure the border first. There can be no talk of "amnesty," they say, until the flow of illegal immigrants is stanched.
That is not realistic, Democrats and many independent experts say. If the U.S. military couldn't secure the borders of Iraq from militants crossing from Syria and Iran, they say, it is unlikely that the Border Patrol or the National Guard can stop every hungry worker or kilo of cocaine moving out of Mexico.
"Unless and until Washington steps up and enacts a coherent, comprehensive and national immigration policy, we will continue to see this debate roil local and state politics from coast to coast," said Frank Sherry, executive director of America's Voice, an immigration rights group. "It can only be solved by Congress and the administration. Comprehensive immigration reform that combines targeted enforcement with a legal workforce is what the American people want."
Yet many Americans reject that premise. They believe that what's needed is tougher enforcement, and they argue that the federal government simply lacks the will.
"Instead of wasting taxpayer resources filing a lawsuit against Arizona and complaining that the law would be burdensome, the Obama administration should have focused its efforts on working with Congress to provide the necessary resources to support the state in its efforts to act where the federal government has failed to take responsibility," said Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who once supported an immigration policy overhaul but now, facing a tough challenge in the Republican primary, backs the law in his home state.
Recognizing the desire for tougher enforcement, Obama dispatched 1,200 National Guard troops to the area.
The administration also is on track to deport 400,000 illegal immigrants this year, the most in U.S. history. Authorities say their top priority is to remove criminals and those who have been previously deported.
"Over the past 18 months, this administration has dedicated unprecedented resources to secure the border," Department of Homeland Security spokesman Matt Chandler said in a statement responding to the court decision. "DHS will enforce federal immigration laws in Arizona and around the country in smart, effective ways that focus our resources on criminal aliens who pose a public safety threat and employers who knowingly hire illegal labor, as well as continue to secure our border."
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has accused Republicans of demagoguery.
"Their position has evolved to be, 'We don't even want to talk about immigration reform unless you secure -- read: seal -- the border,' " she said in an interview last month. "And the definition of what securing the border means keeps changing, and that then becomes a reason not to address the real underlying issue, which is immigration reform."
The GOP sees it differently.
But both sides agree on the state of play: political gridlock.
"Nothing's going to happen before the election," said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), though he held out hope for some action in a lame-duck, postelection legislative session.
"In this atmosphere I don't see anything going anywhere," said Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).

Full text: The Supreme Court, where the legal controversy over Arizona's immigration law is likely to be resolved, has taken a dim view in recent years of judges striking down state laws based on broad challenges to laws that have not taken effect.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton agreed Wednesday with the Obama administration that much of the Arizona law was unconstitutional "on its face," without waiting for evidence that individuals were harmed or had their rights violated by state officials.
In her ruling, Bolton read the Arizona law broadly to apply to "all arrestees" in the state, not just those for whom there is a "reasonable suspicion" they are in the country illegally, as the state's lawyers interpreted the law.
Relying on her understanding of the law's scope, Bolton said it was unconstitutional because legal immigrants and U.S. citizens "will necessarily be swept up" by it.
Some legal experts say the judge's approach leaves her ruling vulnerable to being reversed on appeal.
"She rejected the state's own interpretation of its statute, which is fundamental error in my view," said John Eastman, a law professor and former dean at Chapman University School of Law in California. "And she struck it down on a facial challenge, which is another significant error."
Yale law professor Peter Schuck agreed that the judge might have acted too soon.
"By entertaining a facial challenge rather than waiting for an 'as applied' challenge, she jumped the gun," he said.
Doing so left her without "the benefit of a real set of facts to use in assessing the statute's meaning and constitutionality," he said. "She also gave short shrift to the presumption of constitutionality that federal judges are supposed to bring to any challenge to state statutes."
However, Bolton's decision may stand if the Supreme Court follows its precedents on immigration, which have held that the responsibility for immigration law rests entirely with the federal government.
Her opinion relied heavily on a 1941 ruling in which the justices struck down a Pennsylvania law that required aliens to carry an identification card.
She quoted Justice Hugo Black's comment that such a state identification system would infringe on "the personal liberties of law-abiding aliens" and subject them to threat of "police surveillance."
Experts in immigration law generally gave Bolton high marks in following the court's past precedents. "It's a careful and well-reasoned opinion," said Hiroshi Motomura, a UCLA law professor. She followed the long-standing court precedent that said immigration enforcement is for the federal government, not the states, he said.
The judge focused on one sentence of the Arizona law that said, "Any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is released." Even though the state said it was targeting illegal immigrants, Bolton said its law as written would affect "the lives of legally present aliens and even United States citizens."
"That's a powerful and important aspect of this opinion. She recognized this is going to lead to harassment and interrogation of people who are here lawfully," said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Omar Jadwat.
On Thursday, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer asked the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to lift the judge's order in early September and allow the law to take effect.
If the state loses before the liberal-leaning 9th Circuit, it is almost sure to appeal to the more conservative Supreme Court.
The outcome there may depend on whether the justices rely on their past precedents on immigration or follow their more recent skepticism toward broad challenges to state laws.
Led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the court in the last five years has insisted on narrower, targeted suits that challenge how laws work in actual practice.
The Supreme Court will hear a different Arizona immigration case this fall. The state wants to dissolve any business that repeatedly and knowingly hires illegal immigrants. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, joined by the Obama administration, say this state regulatory measure should be struck down because it conflicts with federal immigration law.
The outcome could shape the battle over the Arizona arrest law, said Temple University law professor Peter Spiro. "There's a good chance the court will use this lower profile case to make a broad pronouncement" on the state's authority to enforce immigration, he said.

Full text: The words of the Constitution do not change whether they are being applied to immigration or same-sex marriage, or whether the statute is from California, Massachusetts or Arizona. The 10th Amendment is often cited to support the constitutionality of Arizona's immigration law as a matter of "states' rights." That same 10th Amendment is cited to support the unconstitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibits federal recognition of Massachusetts' same-sex marriages. To agree with one outcome and not the other can be misconstrued as partisan. If the 10th Amendment is good for the goose, it must be good for the gander, although whether conservatives or liberals are ganders is a bit unclear.
But though it may seem that the neutral principles expressed in the 10th Amendment demand uniform results, this isn't quite true. The amendment states: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people." And therein lies the rub. What powers are delegated to the federal government by the Constitution? And which are not? And how do we decide?
The text of the Constitution is the obvious place to start. The Constitution provides that the federal government has powers of "naturalization" and regulating commerce with foreign nations (Article I, Section 8). It also prohibits states from entering treaties (Article I, Section 10). Though immigration (as opposed to citizenship after immigration) is not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, there is a provision that comes close. Article I, Section 9 specifically limits congressional power: "The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person."
The provision is, of course, rooted in the slave trade. But by limiting congressional power until a certain date -- 1808 -- the implication is clear that migration of persons was intended to be an ordinary federal, rather than state, power.
In addition to the text, the history of constitutional interpretation is another guidepost to who has what powers. The DOMA litigation is not the first time Massachusetts has relied on the 10th Amendment. Massachusetts passed a statute barring state vendors from doing business with Myanmar (previously Burma). The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously struck down the statute under the "supremacy clause," not even mentioning the 10th Amendment. It was sufficient that there were presidential and congressional powers to develop a comprehensive national and international strategy.
Marriage, of course, does not appear in the Constitution, so judicial interpretation is where we find guidance on this issue. The federal courts shy away from family law. The U.S. Supreme Court has declared only a handful of state marriage laws unconstitutional, the most famous example being the Virginia statute criminalizing interracial marriage. But when striking down congressional statutes, the high court has repeatedly touted marriage and family law as the unquestionable domain of state, rather than federal, power. No matter how contentious they may seem, divorces and child custody disputes rarely become federal cases.
Finally, there are also our common practices and understandings about the difference between immigration and marriage. If you have a passport, its navy blue cover bears the seal "United States of America," not, for example, Colorado or California. You need not present your passport when you cross the George Washington Bridge or the Hoover Dam. On the other hand, if you have a marriage certificate, it is embossed with the name of the state in which you obtained the license, rather than "the United States." If you have a divorce decree, it likewise bears the name of the state court in which you obtained the judgment.
By constitutional text, established interpretation and everyday practice, immigration is a federal matter and marriage is a state concern. When it comes to applying a neutral principle such as the 10th Amendment -- powers not given to the federal government are reserved for the states or people -- the very impartiality of the principle may yield inconsistent outcomes.

Full text: With most of Arizona's new immigration law blocked by a judge, controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio launched his 17th "crime suppression" sweep in Maricopa County, pledging late Thursday afternoon to have his deputies and volunteers check the immigration status of those arrested.
"We're looking for anybody who violates the law," he said. "If we find any illegal aliens, they are going to be arrested."
The operation began about 4 p.m. after being delayed for several hours while his deputies responded to demonstrations outside the county jail in Phoenix. During those protests, several people were arrested and others detained, including a legal observer and a news photographer.
Teams of Arpaio's deputies, followed by media vans, spread out across the city and elsewhere in Maricopa County. By Thursday evening, officials said they had not yet counted the number of arrests.
Arpaio predicted that the publicity would cut down on the total. Since beginning the sweeps in 2008, deputies have made nearly 1,000 arrests -- nearly 70% of them illegal immigrants -- according to the Sheriff's Department. Most have been for minor offenses.
People across the country also participated in protests and civil disobedience acts to oppose Arizona's policies against illegal immigrants. The state's new law took effect Thursday, though a judge Wednesday blocked the most controversial parts.
In Los Angeles, 200 protesters blocked traffic on Wilshire Boulevard for hours, causing severe traffic jams around Hancock Park and the Miracle Mile. At least 10 people were arrested after the activists chained themselves together with plastic pipes and handcuffs.
Arpaio is under investigation by the Department of Justice for possible civil rights violations. Immigrant rights advocates condemn his tactics and say he uses minor infractions as a pretext for arresting illegal immigrants and processing them for deportation. During the protests Thursday, dozens of people chanted, "Arrest Arpaio, not the people!"
"Joe Arpaio has shown a disregard for basic constitutional protections," said Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborers Organizing Network, who traveled from Los Angeles to Phoenix this week. "People in Maricopa County have grown accustomed to defending themselves from his so-called crime suppression sweeps."
Arpaio said Thursday that he doesn't go looking for illegal immigrants but finds them because they are out breaking the law. Arpaio said he timed the operation for the day SB 1070 took effect to send a message -- that nothing is changing despite U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton's ruling.
"I want the people of Maricopa County to know, 'Hey if you are here illegally and you commit a crime -- go somewhere else,' " he said.
On Wednesday, Bolton issued a preliminary injunction blocking several parts of the law, including one provision that would have made it a state crime to lack immigration papers.
Since making the ruling, Bolton has received some threats, according to the U.S. marshal for Arizona. The marshal said the judge had received thousands of phone calls and e-mails, including some from people who "expressed their displeasure in a perverted way."

Full text: Some people look at an impoverished immigrant laborer and immediately think "illegal," with all the stigma that word carries.
Others see that same person and think: There goes a worker.
Betty Madden, a 65-year-old costume designer, told me that when she thinks of immigrants, she thinks about their labor -- the folding of linens, the cleaning of bathrooms. Once she was arrested in a Los Angeles protest supporting mostly immigrant hotel workers who perform those tasks. She stood up for them because she's a member of the stage crafts union and loyal to the labor movement.
"In a union, any time you feel you're being attacked or singled out in some way, you have a community to stand up for you," she said.
Along with nearly 600 other union workers and leaders, Madden planned to travel to Phoenix on Thursday, the day SB 1070 was scheduled to take effect.
A federal judge this week blocked most of the law's provisions. But Madden and the activists went anyway, symbolically carrying no documents.
To some, it might seem odd that union workers would protest a law designed to speed the removal of undocumented immigrants. After all, those immigrants are supposedly lowering our wages and busting our state and local budgets.
But the bus riders didn't see it that way. They were more worried about the potential of the law to intimidate legal immigrants, who happen to make up a big chunk of the union workforce in L.A., Phoenix and other cities of the Southwest.
"It's important for white folks like myself who have a little bit of privilege to stand up and say this is wrong," said Dan Barnhart, an L.A. teacher and native of Tempe, Ariz., who also went on the ride.
Barnhart is one of the legions of Angelenos who don't believe illegal immigrant equals criminal. When he thinks of illegal immigrants, he thinks of people who need his help.
He thinks of a girl he knows, of elementary school age, who is just starting to become aware that the border crossing she made when she was a baby will cast a pall over her future. And a brilliant, English-speaking teenage girl he knows whose future education is in doubt because college financial aid is largely unavailable to her.
"She's a brilliant person who did everything right in her life," Barnhart said of the teenager. "And yet there are people willing to say, 'Sorry, you broke the law when you were 18 months old.'" Barnhart thinks such an attitude violates basic American notions of fairness.
Of course, I agree with Barnhart. So do a lot of other people. That's why most Americans back the notion that we should give most illegal immigrants a path to citizenship -- a whopping 81% of Americans, according to a CNN poll released Wednesday.
And yet, the same poll shows a majority of Americans -- 55%-- backed the Arizona immigration law.
It seems to me that Americans are of two minds about the immigration question. They like the immigrants they know personally and are willing to extend this generosity of spirit to many of those who've entered the country illegally. At the same time, they believe the United States is a country of laws and want a system where those laws are respected.
But I'm certain it's only a small minority of Americans that truly believes, as one reader put it to me, that illegal immigrants are an "invading criminal army" bent on destroying America. Unfortunately, that minority put its stamp on SB 1070 -- even though stats show crime is actually down in Arizona in recent years and numerous studies show that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born.
"There's a lot of fear out there, and when there's fear it leads to prejudice and anger," said Shahe Keshishian, a 39-year-old home healthcare worker, and another member of the bus caravan.
Keshishian said he worried that SB 1070 was liable to lead to the same kind of racial profiling he's suffered at the airport at the hands of Homeland Security.
"People, they think I'm Arab or Muslim," said Keshishian, an evangelical Christian and U.S. citizen of Armenian descent.
Depending on your point of view, what Keshishian suffers at the airport is either racial profiling or a mere inconvenience suffered by a few in the name of keeping us all safe. Whatever it is, a small minority of very angry Americans is willing to force legal immigrants and many Latinos to pay a similar price if it will rid the country of illegal immigrants.
They feel this way, it seems to me, because they've embraced a mythology that equates the undocumented with inherent criminality. In their eyes, people are crossing the border not to be gardeners and nannies, but rather to work for the drug cartels, live off the public dime and steal Americans' identities.
A number of shameless politicos are pandering to this way of thinking and fueling the flames of prejudice.
Last month, the Washington Post's Dana Milbank did a wonderful job of dissecting Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer's and Sen. John McCain's exaggerations and falsehoods about the alleged illegal immigrant threat. Brewer, for instance, spoke of beheadings in the Arizona desert that have never taken place.
And last year, I dedicated a column to dispelling 10 statistics circulating on the Internet about the cost of illegal immigration to California. I discovered that many of those "facts" were pure fiction.
Thankfully, most Americans can see hysteria about the "illegals" for what it really is.
Madden told me one of the reasons she went to Arizona is precisely because she can't stand all the "radical" rhetoric she's hearing.
"People spew misinformation and misguided values," she told me. "They get a sympathetic ear because there are so many misinformed people. You have to get on board the fantasy."
It's wrong to blame undocumented immigrants for all that ails America. But it's not a pipe dream to work toward an orderly immigration system in which the law is respected by all and we recognize the labor of those who've worked hard and risked much to be here.

Abstract: The crackdown on travelers is not in itself new. Since last year, a number of camps have been dismantled. According to advocacy groups, many legitimate travelers already suffered discrimination before this latest crackdown, for example regularly having to present themselves at police stations, facing steps to deny them their voting rights and having difficultly educating their children.

Full text: PARIS -- President Nicolas Sarkozy has ordered the expulsion of illegal Roma and itinerant immigrants and the dismantlement of their camps in a move that has been labeled by human rights groups as xenophobic and criticized by his political opponents.
After a meeting late Wednesday, Mr. Sarkozy ordered the expulsion of Roma, with generational roots in Romania and Bulgaria, who had committed public-order offenses and said that illegal camps would be taken down. The Elysee Palace said legislation would be introduced before the end of the year to facilitate the process "for reasons of public order."
Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux said Thursday on RTL radio that over the next three months he would use decrees to dismantle about 300 illegal camps, of which 200 belong to Roma. These camps are the source of "illicit trafficking, children exploited for begging, prostitution or delinquency," he said.
Those in France illegally or who have committed public-order offenses will be sent "almost immediately" back to their countries of origin without the possibility of returning, Mr. Hortefeux said, promising the use of digital fingerprinting technology to ensure this end.
He said the government was not stigmatizing the Roma, also referred to as Gypsies, but rather responding to concerns about public safety.
The move follows several recent incidents that have alarmed the population about public security.
This month, there was rioting in a suburb of Grenoble, in southeastern France, after the death of a local man as he fled the police, allegedly after holding up a casino. There was also violence in the small town of Saint-Aignan, in the Loire Valley, after Roma attacked a police station following an incident in which a gendarme shot and killed a traveler who had driven through a checkpoint.
As interior minister under President Jacques Chirac, Mr. Sarkozy had a reputation for talking and acting tough against delinquency. In 2005, as he sought to counter an explosion of youth violence in the suburbs, Mr. Sarkozy fueled anger by referring to the culture of "racaille," a derogatory term variously translated into English as "scum," "thugs," "rabble," "scoundrels," "lowlife" and "riffraff."
But Mr. Sarkozy emerged from that episode with polls showing he took the right approach in putting down the unrest. Now, confronted by stubbornly high unemployment and pushing tricky financial and social reforms, Mr. Sarkozy faces declining popularity in opinion polls and an election in 2012 against a strengthening Socialist Party.
La Ligue des Droits de l'Homme, a rights group, said the steps would "reinforce negative repressive measures."
The government is "mixing up the situation of the European Roma with the travelers who have French nationality" and, "as a result of a few cases, developing the idea that there is an ethnic solution to the problem of delinquency."
Amnesty International estimates that there are 400,000 itinerants or travelers with French nationality, and 20,000 Roma, in the country. They are mainly more recent immigrants with roots in Central and Eastern Europe.
The crackdown on travelers is not in itself new. Since last year, a number of camps have been dismantled. In October 2009, 200 to 300 Roma were expelled by riot police officers from their camp north of Paris on the orders of a judge. Mr. Hortefeux, the interior minister, said 9,875 Romanian and Bulgarian Roma were expelled from France last year.
Communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants are obliged by law to set aside areas for travelers. According to Amnesty International, fewer than half of them actually do so. As a result, many travelers set up illegal camps, usually on scrub or waste land on the outskirts of towns. Such camps are a common sight in small towns in the Paris region and beyond.
According to advocacy groups, many legitimate travelers already suffered discrimination before this latest crackdown, for example regularly having to present themselves at police stations, facing steps to deny them their voting rights and having difficultly educating their children.
Compounding the sense of discrimination, representatives of French Roma said that they were not invited to the presidential meeting Wednesday.
Throughout Europe, Roma were persecuted by the Nazis during World War II, with many rounded up and sent to concentration camps. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum estimates that 200,000 were killed in this way; some estimates are many times higher.
Romania has an estimated one million Roma, the most of any other European country.
Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union in 2007, enshrining free movement of people. But citizens from Bulgaria and Romania are subject to transitional provisions in France, requiring them to obtain a permit in order to work in certain professions.
Romania's prime minister, Emil Boc, said Thursday that all European countries had a "common obligation" toward the millions of Roma on the Continent, The Associated Press reported.
Mr. Sarkozy also proposed that France bring in Romanian and Bulgarian police officers to work in the Paris region and send the French police to Romania and Bulgaria to help fight trafficking and other crime by Roma.
Pouria Amirshari, the Socialists' national secretary for human rights, told the Nouvel Observateur that the president was "following a xenophobic logic." He described Mr, Sarkozy's intervention as "populist and demagogic."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Hundreds of marchers protesting Arizona's hard-line stance against illegal immigration took to the streets Thursday even as the local sheriff launched raids to arrest illegal migrants -- vivid signs that the court ruling stopping most of a controversial state law will not quell the furious debate over immigration here.
And as expected, the state swiftly appealed the ruling by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton, who on Wednesday temporarily halted key parts of the law one day before they were to take effect.
The protesters began marching well before dawn, fanning out across the city, staging acts of civil disobedience and arguing that Arizona remains inhospitable to immigrants. Dozens of protesters were arrested.
"It's not over yet," said Vanessa Bustos, 24, of Phoenix, who chained herself to five other activists, blocking the door to the Maricopa County jail. "There are other bills being enacted against the Latino community."
Showing that Arizona can take strong steps against illegal immigrants despite the ruling, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio launched his 17th sweep Thursday, in which his deputies and volunteers stop people for sometimes minor violations, such as jaywalking, and then check their immigration status -- which police are already allowed to do under existing law.
Arpaio has said the temporary injunction against the law, SB 1070, doesn't stop him from driving illegal immigrants from the state.
"Nothing is going to deter this sheriff and my office, including rulings by the federal judge," Arpaio told reporters at a midday news conference. "It's going to be business as usual."
In the state's appeal, Gov. Jan Brewer asked the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the temporary injunction as soon as possible. Oral arguments could occur in September.
"We are a nation of laws and we believe they need to be enforced," Brewer said in a statement. "If the federal government wants to be in charge of illegal immigration and they want no help from states, it then needs to do its job."
Technically, SB 1070 took effect Thursday, but Bolton's ruling -- issued after the Obama administration sued and contended the law interfered with federal immigration enforcement -- barred most of its provisions until a trial on the bill's constitutionality. The key provisions would have required police to determine the status of people they lawfully stop and also suspect are in the country illegally. The law also would have made it a state crime to lack immigration documents.
Brewer signed the bill April 23, arguing it was needed to protect the state from drug violence seeping in from Mexico.
Some of the measure's supporters argued that the provisions halted by Bolton would not have changed much on the ground here. Everyone booked into the jails in the state's most populous counties has his or her status checked. Police officers can already ask anyone they choose about his or her immigration status.
Mark Spencer, board president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Assn., a police union that is a strong backer of the law, said SB 1070 merely would have required other agencies to employ procedures widely used in Phoenix.
"We were test-driving SB 1070" in Phoenix, Spencer said. "Now we're going to take it on a long-term road trip. Nothing changed for the Phoenix Police Department."
The law makes "attrition through enforcement" Arizona's official policy, meaning the state will take whatever legal steps it can to make life unpleasant for illegal immigrants and persuade them to leave.
Despite the court victory, immigrant rights activists decided to follow through with protests scheduled Thursday, when the entire law was to have taken effect. Polls have shown that SB 1070 is highly popular in Arizona, and marchers said the injunction doesn't change how immigrants and Latinos are treated here.
"We live here in a climate of fear," said Alfredo Gutierrez, a former Democratic state senator who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2002. He joined about 100 people on a two-mile march from the state Capitol at 4:30 a.m. and was later arrested. "The context of Arizona is foreign to this country. This is basically a nation that's become hostile to its own people."
Channtal Polanco, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen, was one of several people who have staged a 24-hour vigil at the state Capitol during the 104 days since the Legislature passed SB 1070. On Thursday morning, she said she was inspired by a cousin who had asked if Polanco would be guardian to his daughter should he and his wife be deported.
"That broke my heart," Polanco said.
Since 2004, Arizona has passed a series of laws aimed at illegal immigrants -- tightening restrictions on identification needed to vote, limiting the ability of illegal immigrants to post bail after arrest and dissolving companies who hire them. Recent bills have been interpreted by some as a straight-out attack on Latinos -- a law that seeks to eliminate a Mexican American studies program and a regulation that stops teachers with accents from teaching certain public school classes.
On Thursday the demonstrations started with the predawn march to a downtown church, led by women holding images of the Virgin of Guadalupe. After a 90-minute service, the growing crowd marched to the downtown high-rise that houses Arpaio's executive offices.
Marchers waved signs that said "We reject racism" and "No more raids."
Gloria Lopez, 36, and her husband, Roberto, are both illegal immigrants who live in Phoenix. They have six U.S.-born children, have been here 22 years and hold steady jobs. "The American Dream doesn't exist," Gloria Lopez said. "We aren't free."
Lopez said she and her family continue to live in fear of the sheriff. "Senor Arpaio, with the law or without the law, he's going to continue."
Demonstrators eventually disobeyed police orders to remain on the sidewalks, spilling out into the wide thoroughfare and blocking traffic. Police arrested more than two dozen there and at the jail. (In Los Angeles, about a dozen protesters against SB 1070 were arrested after blocking portions of Wilshire Boulevard.)
Kristin Larson, 36, watched the Phoenix protests in disgust, holding a handwritten sign supporting Arpaio. "I see this happening over and over again, and I don't see support for the other side," said Larson, who works downtown and watches regular protests against Arpaio. She said she was frustrated by people from outside Arizona criticizing the state.
"The border needs to be secured and they need to find a way to fix it," she said.

Full text: Many will see Judge Susan Bolton's decision to block parts of Arizona's new immigration law solely as an affirmation of the federal government's primacy over the states. But a close look at her ruling reveals that she's handed Arizona a significant victory against renegade localities seeking to undercut our nation's immigration laws.
For example, Judge Bolton let stand A.R.S. <sect> 11-1051(A), which prohibits Arizona officials, agencies and political subdivisions from limiting enforcement of federal immigration laws. A.R.S. <sect> 11-1051(C)-(F), which requires that state officials work with federal officials with regard to aliens unlawfully in the state, will also remain in force.
Her ruling -- provided it is adopted by other courts across the country-- will drive a stake into the heart of the "sanctuary" movement among cities and towns that feel they have the authority to disregard federal law. Right now, they permit illegal aliens to freely reside within their borders and have access to various benefits that should only be reserved for those here lawfully.
Many local governments -- mostly vocally San Francisco, but also Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler and Tucson -- have conducted themselves as "sanctuaries." As such, they have directed law enforcement personnel within their domains not to cooperate with state or federal law enforcement in the proper handling, including processing for deportation, of illegal immigrants. The court's decision makes it clear that at least in the case of Arizona, localities can no longer delude themselves into thinking this is acceptable.
The court also left unchanged the provision that permits legal residents of Arizona to sue any state official, agency or political subdivision for not enforcing federal immigration laws to the full extent permitted. Such private rights of action in the context of policy issues are unheard of nationally, and may well be the most important component of Arizona's new law. How these suits are implemented, and the impact they'll have on cities and towns that until now have felt free to pursue whatever course they chose without sanction, will be quite interesting to watch.
In addition, Judge Bolton refused to halt the implementation of a variety of amendments to existing Arizona law -- those that pertain to the state's right to control employment within its borders by regulating employers:
-- A.R.S. <sect> 13-2928(A)-(B): creating a crime for stopping a motor vehicle to pick up day laborers and for day laborers to get in a motor vehicle if it impedes the normal movement of traffic;
-- A.R.S. <sect> 23-212: amending the crime of knowingly employing unauthorized aliens;
-- A.R.S. <sect> 23-214: amending the requirements for checking employment eligibility.
Several other provisions of Arizona law pertaining to existing criminal violations also go into effect. First, there is an amendment that would make transporting or harboring an illegal alien an additional offense for a person who has committed another crime (A.R.S. <sect> 13-2929). Another amendment, A.R.S. <sect> 28-3511, calls for the removal or impoundment of a vehicle used to transport or harbor aliens in Arizona illegally.
While there may be joy in certain quarters that Arizona's law enforcement personnel cannot be deputized by their state to enforce federal immigration laws, the reality is that Arizona came away with notable victories that should be acknowledged. Now it must summon the political will to implement them.

Full text: Christmas came early for demagogues. The court decision putting a hold on the worst provisions of Arizona's new anti-Latino immigration law is a gift-wrapped present to those who delight in turning truth, justice and the American way into political liabilities.
As surely everyone knows by now, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday blocking the state from enforcing parts of the law that look patently unconstitutional. The political fallout is pretty clear: In the short run, at least, Republicans win and Democrats lose.
Longer term, the impact of the immigration issue on the major parties' prospects is the other way around. But the focus now is on winning in November, and the GOP is licking its chops.
Critics have another weapon to use against the Obama administration, because it was President Obama's Justice Department that filed suit against the Arizona law. Attorney General Eric Holder chose a relatively narrow argument: that the draconian measure was a blatant usurpation of the federal government's prerogative to establish and enforce immigration laws.
Bolton agreed, and she enjoined the parts of the measure that ventured onto federal turf. The Justice Department did not ask her to address the other big problem with the law, which is that it amounts to a prescription for racial profiling on a scale not seen in this country since the days of Jim Crow laws in the South. But Bolton went there anyway.
If local police are ordered to verify the immigration status of anyone they detain or question, there is a "substantial likelihood" that such an indiscriminate dragnet will sweep up legal resident aliens, foreign tourists with valid visas and even U.S. citizens -- in other words, anyone who looks kind of Mexican.
Aside from Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- a grandstanding publicity hound who already stages immigration raids for the television cameras -- virtually all prominent law enforcement officials in the state opposed the law. They argued that it would overburden their resources, potentially put their officers in danger and, most important, make it much harder to investigate crimes. Imagine two men in a car who happen to be waiting at a stoplight when a brutal mugging takes place before their eyes. If the new law were in effect, and if one of those witnesses were here illegally, what are the odds that they'd stick around to tell police what they saw?
We'll hear no such subtlety or nuance from Republicans this fall, though. We'll hear thunderous allegations that the Obama administration -- the big, bad federal government -- conspired with an unelected federal judge to keep the state of Arizona from enforcing a law that seeks only to kick out of the country a bunch of people who have no right to be here.
We'll hear from GOP candidates that Arizona had to act because the federal government refuses to "secure the border." The fact is that President Obama has sharply increased border enforcement and deportations; the influx of undocumented immigrants is greatly reduced from what it was during the Bush administration. But there Obama goes again, trying to find a sane, moderate course of action. Predictably, he's getting hit from both sides -- the anti-immigrant crowd that claims he's not doing enough, and the pro-immigrant crowd that complains he's doing too much.
Immigration wasn't always a partisan issue, but that's what it has become; even John McCain, once a strong advocate of comprehensive reform, now sides with the xenophobes. This is a huge long-term problem for Republicans, who risk becoming branded as the anti-Latino party -- and driving the nation's biggest and fastest-growing minority group into the arms of the Democratic Party for a generation or more.
Smart GOP strategists such as Karl Rove understand this danger and have sounded warnings. But their voices are drowned out by those who demand that authorities somehow track down, apprehend and expel the estimated 11 million people here without documents, the vast majority of whom are law-abiding and productive. Anything short of an all-out pogrom is labeled "amnesty" -- the kind of craven surrender favored by such liberal bleeding-hearts as Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.
"No to illegal immigration" is a simple sound bite that will win votes for some Republican candidates. Democrats find themselves stuck with words that work better as a movie title than as a campaign slogan: "Do the right thing."

Full text: The court victory that the Obama administration won this week in Arizona will not make the ugly national tension over illegal immigration go away. The president needs to take this brief respite, step back from the Washington logjam and remember what he and every president since Ronald Reagan has been trying to achieve.
If he does, he might ask: Why not accept John McCain's 10-point border security plan?
Answer: He should. Now. Or immediately after the Arizona primary election on Aug. 24.
Policy wonks and pro-immigrant Democrats will object, but they are stuck in a mind-set that no longer applies. Rightly or wrongly, the public's patience with illegal immigration has run out. Barack Obama, like George W. Bush before him, has had no choice politically or legally but to enforce the law. The ballooning enforcement budget -- about 10 times larger than in 1993 -- is diminishing the flow of new immigrants.
But it is also forcing Obama to do what he and the other presidents have tried to avoid: deport those unauthorized people -- many with families -- who are honest and hardworking and integral to the U.S. economy. This year alone, the Obama administration is on track to deport about 400,000 illegal immigrants -- only a small percentage of them real criminals -- out of an estimated population of less than 11 million.
Nearly 5 percent of the nation's workforce is made up of unauthorized immigrants. Large parts of agriculture, construction, and the leisure and hospitality industries would risk collapse if workers were deported. In 2008, the last year for which data are available, the unauthorized made up 19 percent of building, groundskeeping and maintenance workers; 17 percent of the construction trades; and 12 percent of food preparation and service workers, according to the Census Bureau.
It is easy to say that unemployed Americans would fill these jobs -- even if that were possible, which it largely isn't -- but the economic upheaval would be disastrous at a time when the nation is struggling to recover from a deep recession.
Most of these immigrants are now part of us. Some Americans are obsessed with blaming the immigrants for being illegal, but that thinking fails to recognize that we as a nation are as guilty as these gardeners, dishwashers, baby sitters, home-care providers and chicken-pluckers. The hiring of unauthorized workers was part of a tacitly accepted labor system begun by farmers in the Southwest in the 1960s and spread by employers and consumers across the country. All acted illegally.
Illegal immigrants helped fuel the great economic expansion of the 1990s and into this decade. It is true that the shrunken pie caused by the recession now has to be split among more mouths, but that is what you do in a family and community.
Perhaps this is why in polls, most Americans say they want to legalize those already here while backing the Arizona law as a way to stop more from coming illegally. In a CNN/Opinion Research poll released this week, fully 81 percent said they would favor "creating a program that would allow illegal immigrants already living in the United States for a number of years to stay here and apply to legally remain in this country permanently if they had a job and paid back taxes."
Yet Obama remains stuck with his supporters in trying to craft outdated grand bargains that would trade legalization for enforcement that is already being done.
Obama should hold a summit on the border with Southwest senators, accept the plan by McCain and Sen. Jon Kyl, also of Arizona, and say that he is submitting legislation that would lead to legalization. Privately, he should challenge the Southwest Republicans to take credit for the enforcement or be exposed for economic and moral irresponsibility if they continue to demand that enforcement be implemented "first," which their histories suggest they don't actually believe in.
The McCain-Kyl plan calls for 6,000 National Guard troops, more Border Patrol officers, drones and expansion of a program that jails repeat border jumpers under criminal charges.
McCain, once vulnerable, now coasts to reelection. He is the Senate linchpin. His plan may be more grandstanding than effective policy, but the alternative is the steady deportation of nearly 11 million people. We would all suffer.

Full text: The federal judge who blocked key aspects of Arizona's new immigration law was so well regarded across the political spectrum that she was nominated to the federal bench by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, who tapped her on the recommendation of Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), one of Congress's most conservative senators.
This week, however, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton became one of the nation's most divisive figures, after halting much of Arizona's high-profile effort to identify and deport illegal immigrants.
Hate mail and threats flowed into her court offices, according to news reports. Conservative bloggers decried her "activist" leanings and accused her of falling in with the American Civil Liberties Union, a prominent challenger of the law and a favorite target of the right. And Kyl, who during Bolton's nomination hearings in 2000 lauded her expertise and fairness, did not conceal his disappointment.
"I really thought that she would uphold most of the law and allow Arizona to try to do its best to enforce the law to the extent that the federal government wasn't doing so," he said on the Fox News program "Happening Now."
Bolton is no stranger to controversy or to cases that might elicit death threats. Since beginning her career as a judge in 1989, she has taken on Mexican smugglers, civil libertarians and members of the Arizona legislature. While a Superior Court justice in Maricopa County, she handled some of the most complex and delicate cases to come before the court, a colleague said. In her decade on the federal bench, she has overseen cases that touched on border issues.
No other case, however, has thrust her into the national spotlight like her decision Wednesday to block the most contentious parts of Arizona's law, including provisions that would have required police officers to check the immigration status of people they arrest. People close to Bolton said she is a meticulous jurist who is not easily shaken by such attention.
"Put it this way: Susan has never been accused of being a coward," said retired Superior Court Judge Ken Fields, who worked alongside Bolton for a decade. "She's probably the perfect judge to have for this case. She analyzes the facts and makes a decision without bias one way or the other."
Bolton, 58, a Philadelphia native, attended college and law school in Iowa. Shortly after receiving her law degree, she joined a firm in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. She served on the state Superior Court for Maricopa County from 1989 until 2000, when she was appointed to the federal bench.
During her tenure, she has handled numerous cases related to illegal immigration. In 2001, she presided over the case of a smuggler sentenced to 16 years in prison for leading 14 illegal immigrants to their deaths in the desert. A year later, she dismissed a suit by legal U.S. residents against Border Patrol agents accused of racial profiling in a 1997 immigration raid.
In a 2000 decision that angered some politicians, she removed from the ballot a growth-control measure backed by the state legislature, ruling it unconstitutional. It had been proposed as an alternative to an environmentalist-backed measure.
Friends and colleagues say Bolton is hardworking, intelligent and exceptionally confident in the courtroom. Lawyers who have brought cases before her say she is well prepared and thorough, prone to asking her questions of witnesses as she gathers information to rule on a case.
John Randolph, who knows her from her days in private practice in Tempe in the 1970s and 1980s, said she had an "intellectual interest in the arguments" related to violence against women. In 1987, she co-authored with her husband, Frank G. Bolton, the book "Working With Violent Families: A Guide for Clinical and Legal Practitioners."
Randolph described Bolton as intellectually curious and well versed on subjects ranging from art to world affairs, which they would often talk about at length with their spouses over the dinner table, but said she has never tipped her hand on her political views.
"She was very difficult to figure out politically," he said. "I couldn't figure it out then, and I can't figure it out now."

Full text: Hundreds of opponents of Arizona's new immigration law swarmed the streets of downtown Phoenix Thursday, confronting police in riot gear as the state's governor filed an urgent appeal of a judge's ruling that prevented key portions of the law from taking effect.
Condemning what they called the "terrorizing" of Hispanics, protesters blockaded a jail and marched to the offices of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his aggressive stance on illegal immigrants. The sheriff vowed a "crime sweep" targeting illegal immigrants but later postponed the raids. At least 17 protesters were arrested.
With the case's future uncertain, the demonstrations illustrated that tensions over the state's immigration crackdown may only have been heightened by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton's ruling Wednesday in the Obama administration's lawsuit against Arizona. Bolton temporarily blocked the law's most controversial sections, but protesters objected to other provisions that she allowed to take effect on Thursday.
A day after Bolton's decision riveted attention on illegal immigration, it was clear that the increasingly divisive debate is spreading nationwide.
Nearly 20 states have introduced bills similar to the Arizona law, and nine states with Republican attorneys general are planning to file appellate briefs supporting Arizona. Immigration is a key theme in this fall's midterm elections; at the same time conservative candidates are attacking what they say is the Obama administration's aggressive expansion of government.
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R), whose fierce criticism of the federal lawsuit has helped her popularity at home, on Thursday appealed Bolton's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. Urging the court to quickly hear the case, she vowed that she "will not back down." The Justice Department, whose lawsuit against Arizona was a rare federal challenge of a state law, declined to comment.
If the political reactions to Bolton's decision were predictable, the legal path forward was not. The 9th Circuit has a liberal reputation, and court officials said the case will be heard by a "motions panel" designed for urgent appeals. The panel this month consists of three judges who, like Bolton, were appointed by Democratic presidents.
But if the panel's decision is appealed to the full 9th Circuit, 10 of the 11 judges will be chosen by a random computerized draw. The 11th jurist will be Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, a Republican appointee.
Although many legal experts believe the case is ultimately headed to the Supreme Court, it is unclear at what point in the process that might happen. If the 9th Circuit upholds Bolton's preliminary injunction, experts said it is unlikely the high court would disturb such a ruling until the case over the law is decided.
The Supreme Court already has one Arizona immigration challenge on its fall docket. It has agreed to hear a case brought by an unusual coalition of business groups and civil rights organizations seeking to overturn a separate state law that revokes the business licenses of employers who hire illegal immigrants.
The Justice Department filed suit July 6, seeking to overturn the newer and more comprehensive Arizona immigration law, which Brewer signed in April. The law empowers police to question people whom they have a "reasonable suspicion" are illegal immigrants. Federal lawyers argued that it intruded into exclusive federal immigration enforcement.
In her ruling Wednesday, Bolton put on hold -- while the lawsuit proceeds -- sections of the law that have drawn the most opposition from civil rights groups. They include provisions that would require police to check immigration status if they stop someone while enforcing other laws, allow for warrantless arrests of suspected illegal immigrants and criminalize the failure of immigrants to carry registration papers. She allowed other portions to take effect, including one making it a crime to stop a car to pick up day laborers.
Brewer's lawyers argued in their appeal that the injunction violates "Arizona's right to implement a law its Legislature enacted to address the irreparable harm Arizona is suffering as a result of unchecked unlawful immigration." Court officials said an initial ruling could come within days.
In the other Arizona case being considered by the Supreme Court, the Obama administration had urged the court to set aside the 2007 law sanctioning employers who hire illegal immigrants. That case presented a sticky situation for the administration: The law was signed by then-Gov. Janet Napolitano, who is now homeland security secretary. Her statement then is at odds with the government's arguments now that the state has no role in immigration enforcement.
"Immigration is a federal responsibility, but I signed HB 2779 because it is now abundantly clear that Congress finds itself incapable of coping with the comprehensive immigration reforms our country needs," Napolitano said at the time.

Full text: VIRGINIA
Corey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, pushed legislation Thursday that would outline how Virginia can crack down on illegal immigration yet avoid the pitfalls Arizona has faced with its controversial immigration law.
Dubbed the Virginia Rule of Law Act, the legislation enhances police officials' power to capture, detain and deport illegal immigrants; curbs illegal day laboring; and creates specific state penalties for illegal immigrants.
Like the Arizona law, Stewart's legislation states that law enforcement officials are required to check the status of anyone who is detained if there is "reasonable suspicion" that the person is here illegally. Stewart, however, said his law will stand up in court because unlike Arizona, Virginia won't make it illegal for people not to carry their immigration documents with them.
Prince William received national attention in 2007 for its crackdown on illegal immigration. Although the county's original law did stand before a judge in Alexandria, the county has since modified the law so that police officers are inquiring into the immigration status of all people who are arrested on suspicion of violating a state or local law.

THE REGION
The head of a drug-trafficking network that supplied PCP, heroin and cocaine in the District and Maryland was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to forfeit $1.1 million in drug proceeds Thursday, ending the career of a man that U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan called "the leader of the largest PCP ring ever in D.C."
Lonnell Glover, 48, of Temple Hills was convicted in Hogan's court in the District in November 2008 of conspiring to distribute PCP after the FBI concluded that he distributed about 50 gallons of the drug over five months in 2007.
Glover was previously sentenced in June to serve 20 years for his role in a separate cocaine ring.
Hogan also sentenced Jerome Hampton, 52, to 10 years and one month in prison Thursday for conspiring with Glover to distribute PCP from his business, Custom Interiors, in Upper Marlboro. Hampton was convicted in October 2009.
The investigation led to raids in June 2007 that recovered more than $400,000 in cash, firearms, gallons of PCP and kilograms of heroin, and 32 alleged conspirators were arrested, according to a statement by U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. and federal and local law enforcement leaders.

Delta Air Lines will add 21 nonstop flights out of Reagan National Airport to seven cities Oct. 31 as part of an East Coast expansion. The destinations are Orlando; Miami; Tampa; St. Louis; Hartford, Conn.; Columbus, Ohio; and Jacksonville, Fla.
Five new flights to Boston and one new flight to Indianapolis will be added; service to Huntsville, Ala., will be discontinued. Tickets for the new flights will be available Saturday.

MARYLAND
Crime in Prince George's County continued its steady decline in the first half of 2010, falling in every major category for a decrease of 6.3 percent compared with the same period last year, authorities announced Wednesday.
Violent crime fell by 11.7 percent, propelled by double-digit percentage-point drops in robberies, rapes and homicides, authorities said. Property crime, which includes burglaries, thefts and stolen vehicles, fell by a smaller margin -- 5.3 percent -- but authorities highlighted it as significant nonetheless.
Prince George's Police Chief Roberto L. Hylton attributed the drop to his efforts to connect with the community, and he dismissed the notion that the decline is unsustainable or of fluke. At the beginning of this year, police in Prince George's boasted that crime had hit the lowest rate since at least 1975, the last year for which comparable figures were available in the county.

Full text: The U.S. Supreme Court, where the legal controversy over Arizona's immigration law is likely to be decided, has taken a dim view in recent years of judges striking down state laws based on broad challenges like the one an Arizona federal judge sided with Wednesday.
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton agreed with the Obama administration that much of the Arizona law was unconstitutional "on its face," without waiting for evidence that individuals were hurt or had their rights violated by state officials.
Bolton read the Arizona law broadly to apply to "all arrestees" in the state, not just those for whom there is a "reasonable suspicion" they are in the country illegally, which is how the state's lawyers interpreted the law. Relying on her broad understanding of its scope, Bolton said the law was unconstitutional because legal immigrants and U.S. citizens "will necessarily be swept up" by it.
Some legal experts say that approach leaves the ruling vulnerable to reversal on appeal.
"She rejected the state's own interpretation of its statute, which is fundamental error in my view," said John Eastman, a law professor and former dean at Chapman University law school in California. "And she struck it down on a facial challenge, which is another significant error."
Yale law professor Peter Schuck agreed the judge might have acted too soon. "By entertaining a facial challenge rather than waiting for an 'as applied' challenge, she jumped the gun," he said. Doing so left her without "the benefit of a real set of facts to use in assessing the statute's meaning and constitutionality," he said. "She also gave short shrift to the presumption of constitutionality that federal judges are supposed to bring to any challenge to state statutes."
However, Bolton's decision may stand if the Supreme Court follows its precedents on immigration, which have held that immigration law rests entirely with the federal government. Her opinion relied heavily on a 1941 ruling in which the justices struck down a Pennsylvania law that required immigrants to carry an identification card. She quoted Justice Hugo Black's comment that such a state identification system would infringe "the personal liberties of law-abiding aliens" and subject them to threat of "police surveillance."
Immigration law experts generally gave Bolton high marks for following the court's precedents. The judge focused on one sentence of the Arizona law that said: "Any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is released." Even though the state said it was targeting illegal immigrants, Bolton said the law as written would affect "the lives of legally present aliens and even United States citizens."
On Thursday, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to lift the judge's order in early September.
If the state loses before the 9th Circuit, it is almost sure to appeal to the Supreme Court.
The outcome there may depend on whether the justices follow their more recent skepticism toward broad challenges to state laws.
The court in the past five years has insisted on narrower, targeted suits that challenge how laws work in actual practice.
The Supreme Court will hear a different Arizona immigration case this fall. The state wants to take away the business licenses of employers that knowingly hire illegal immigrants. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Obama administration say that regulatory measure conflicts with federal immigration law.
"There's a good chance the court will use this lower-profile case to make a broad pronouncement" on the state's authority to enforce immigration, said Temple University law professor Peter Spiro.

Young Illegals Out Themselves, Daring To Be Deported; Civil disobedience by students adds a new twist to the immigration debate.

On July 20, 22 young illegal immigrants in caps and gowns entered the Hart Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C., and began sit-ins in the offices of several senators. Twelve soon returned to the atrium, where they formed a circle around a banner reading "Undocumented and Unafraid." Refusing to be moved, the students were arrested by Capitol Police, as were nine others who had stayed put in the offices of Sen. John McCain and Majority Leader Harry Reid.
Less than two miles away, a similar protest by a separate but allied group was taking place at Lafayette Square in front of the White House. These students went a step further. Openly announcing their immigration status and giving their full names just across the Mall from Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters, they forced a difficult choice upon ICE officials.
Take no action, and ICE would undermine the law. But come down hard by deporting the students, many of them still teenagers, and it would risk drawing overwhelming public outcry.
These individuals--plus several hundred more high school and college students of illegal status--had come to the capital to call for passage of the floundering Dream Act. Dream, the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, co-sponsored by 36 senators, including Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) and Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), would offer temporary residency to students who arrived in the U.S. illegally as minors if they attend college. It would grant them permanent residency upon graduating.
Young people have come to the capital every year since 2001 to demonstrate in support of the act. But many senators suggest that the bill remains five votes short of the 60 needed for cloture, and it has slim prospects of being passed during this session of Congress. So in order to draw greater attention to their cause, affected students decided to undertake a risky form of civil disobedience. If arrested, they faced deportation.
Yet ICE has stated that it has no intention of initiating deportation proceedings against the students arrested in the Washington protests. The officials likely wanted to avoid a repeat of what happened last month with a Harvard student named Eric Balderas.
Mr. Balderas had deportation proceedings opened against him after authorities discovered his status as he was passing through security at an airport. The case attracted widespread media attention and international backlash. Harvard administrators stated their support for Mr. Balderas, whose case was soon taken up by Mr. Durbin. After less than two weeks, ICE backed down, halting Mr. Balderas's deportation indefinitely.
Hoping the sit-in will fade from the public view, ICE is sticking to the safe line that the students' actions in Washington simply "illustrate the need for comprehensive immigration reform," as spokesperson Gillian Brigham told me.
Yet this strikes many on Capitol Hill as an inexcusable failure to enforce the law. "It's outrageous," California Rep. Gary Miller told the Orange County Register. "How can you have a protest right in a U.S. senator's office, admit you are here illegally in violation of the law, and we pat you on the back and do nothing?"
But even doing nothing stands to strengthen the "Dreamers." Pictures of these students protesting with impunity are already making an impression on students of illegal status from coast to coast, spreading the movement with the aid of social networking websites.
With that momentum, the activists intend to maintain a continuous presence in the capital. One organizer, Mo Abdollahi, who was brought to America illegally from Iran as a child, told me that the protests will go on "as long as it takes" for Dream to pass. At the same time, Mr. Abdollahi disputes the notion that these actions are deliberate provocations in the mold of Gandhi or King. He says that the Dreamers are "just trying to live [their] lives." If that means deportation, he says, it is a price they are willing to pay.
Is their goal to force another public deportation crisis like that of Eric Balderas? "We are not deliberately trying to do that," he claims. If the students' civil disobedience brings the force of the law down upon them, he says, that is simply a hazard of their activism. Other student leaders told me that there is more calculation behind the actions in Washington. But whether these activists are naÃ¯ve or calculating, their effectiveness is impossible to dispute.
The protests this month are most significant not because of any direct influence they may have on lawmakers, but because they are drawing other young people with illegal status out into the open, undoing the chilling effect that legal vulnerability has long had on illegal immigrants' political activism. As the fall elections near, such activism will likely serve as another flash point for an already volatile issue.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco set a November hearing date for Arizona's challenge to a court order blocking implementation of key parts of its new law targeting illegal immigrants, rejecting the state's plea to expedite the case and hear arguments in September.
In a brief order, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals set the hearing for the week of Nov. 1. Midterm elections for Congress and state offices are set for Nov. 2.
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer had asked the Ninth Circuit to schedule the hearing for the week of Sept. 13. In her motion, the governor said the court should expedite the case because the state legislature had determined the provisions were "critical to address serious criminal, environmental, and economic problems Arizona has been suffering as a consequence of illegal immigration and the lack of effective enforcement activity by the federal government."
The Justice Department opposed expediting the hearing, saying in its brief that sticking to the normal court schedule would simply "preserve a status quo that has existed for a long period of time."
Arizona didn't ask the Ninth Circuit to stay the lower court order while the case is pending.
The Obama administration filed suit to void provisions of the state law, which it says unconstitutionally interferes with federal authority over immigration. Earlier this week, a federal district judge in Phoenix issued a temporary injunction blocking implementation of those provisions pending a trial.

Full text: About 100 demonstrators rallied inside City Hall on Thursday in support of a federal judge's temporary block of the most controversial sections of Arizona's immigration law.
The crowd also celebrated a recently introduced Chicago City Council resolution that calls for a boycott of Arizona businesses. But the group -- led by immigration groups, elected officials and religious leaders -- said that the fight isn't over.
"The architects of [Arizona SB] 1070 and other vicious, hateful laws have not gone away," said Leone Bicchieri, director of the Chicago Workers Collaborative, referring to the law by its common name. "They're busy regrouping."
Some see the resolution introduced yesterday as a way to fight back. The resolution calls for a second symbolic boycott of Arizona in two months. Like a similar resolution endorsed in June, the one introduced Wednesday calls for Chicago to reject business from Arizona companies and to limit city employees' travel to the state.
"We need to set the example for others in the country and I think this resolution does so," said Ald. Toni Preckwinkle (4th), who spoke at the rally. "This country can do better than Arizona."
Nationally, the legal battle over the law entered its next stage Thursday when Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer filed an expedited appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The appeal asks the court to lift a preliminary injunction granted by a federal judge. The court document suggests a timetable that would have oral arguments on the appeal September 13. Before then, Arizona would file a substantive brief to the court and the U.S. Department of Justice would respond.
"America is not going to sit back and allow the ongoing federal failures to continue," Brewer said in a statement. We are a nation of laws and we believe they need to be enforced."

Full text: The immigration debate is reviving the explosive idea of denying citizenship to children born on U.S. soil if their parents are in the country illegally.
A U.S. senator and a state lawmaker in Arizona, both central players in the battle over immigration law, separately proposed this week that "birthright" citizenship be denied to the children of illegal immigrants. They said the change would help stem the flood of illegal border crossings.
"People come here to have babies. They come here to drop a child," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said Wednesday night on Fox News. "That shouldn't be the case. That attracts people here for all the wrong reasons." Mr. Graham is a onetime partner with Democrats in crafting a proposed overhaul of immigration laws.
Immigration-rights activists say citizenship isn't a significant driver of illegal immigration, because a child has to reach age 21 to petition for permanent legal residency for his or her parents.
Such calls to change what has been a bedrock feature of the immigration system are sure to set off contentious debate. "It's an extreme position, and Sen. Graham knows this," said Angela Kelley of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. "He's not one to tamper with the Constitution, so I'm surprised he would even suggest this."
In Arizona, Republican state Sen. Russell Pearce, the architect of the immigration law that drew a legal challenge from the Obama administration, said he wanted to deny U.S. citizenship to children born in his state to illegal immigrants.
At issue is the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, enacted in 1868 to ensure that states not deny former slaves the full rights of citizenship. It states, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."
Mr. Graham, speaking on Fox, suggested that changing birthright-citizenship rules would require a constitutional amendment. "We should change our Constitution and say if you come here illegally and have a child, that child's not automatically a citizen," he said.
He said he was considering introducing such an amendment. A spokesman said Thursday that Mr. Graham was just discussing the idea and hadn't made any decisions about whether to move ahead.
Mr. Pearce, like some other proponents of the change, argued that the amendment as written doesn't apply to illegal immigrants. Because illegal immigrants aren't "subject to the jurisdiction" of the U.S., as the amendment requires, they fall outside its protection, these people argue. A group of House lawmakers made a similar argument when they tried to pass legislation changing the birthright principle in 2005.
"When it was ratified in 1868, the amendment had to do with African-Americans; it had nothing to do with aliens," Mr. Pearce said. "It's got to be fixed."
Given the controversial nature of this proposal, successfully amending the Constitution would be considered a long shot. It requires a vote of two-thirds of the House and of the Senate, and must be ratified by three-fourths of state legislators.
A change in state law redefining who is a citizen would likely draw a legal challenge, as did Arizona's effort to change state immigration law.
Under Mr. Pearce's proposal, Arizona would refuse to issue a birth certificate to any child unless at least one parent could prove legal presence in the U.S. "The 14th Amendment has been hijacked and abused," Mr. Pearce said. "We incentivize people to break our laws."
The U.S. is home to about 11 million illegal immigrants. There are nearly four million whose children are U.S. citizens, according to a 2009 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.
Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which calls for cracking down on all immigration to the U.S., said that citizenship as a birthright isn't automatic in many countries in the West.
"We should not allow language from 1868 to enslave our thinking . . . in the 21st century," Mr. Stein said.
Mr. Pearce was sponsor of SB1070, the law that required police to check the immigration station of anyone they stop if they suspect unlawful presence. On Wednesday, a federal judge blocked that provision and others, pending further legal review. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed the bill into law, has promised to appeal.
On Thursday, close to a thousand protestors chanted, drummed and participated in street blockades throughout downtown Phoenix to show their intent to resist SB1070. Many were arrested.
"We don't want no police state! Stop the injustice, stop the hate!" hundreds chanted in front of the office of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who supported the law and whose deputies have made it a priority to detain illegal immigrants.

Full text: Author: James Taranto
Shirley Sherrod says she plans to sue conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart, the reports from San Diego: "Speaking Thursday at the National Association of Black Journalists convention, Sherrod said she would definitely sue over the video that took her remarks out of context":
Sherrod said she had not received an apology from Breitbart and no longer wanted one. "He had to know that he was targeting me," she said.
Does she have a winning case? Probably not.
For one thing, the alleged defamation (or, to be precise, the defamation that she would allege if she filed suit) took place while she was a public official and involved claims about the performance of her public duties. Thus she would have to meet the rigorous standard, set forth by the Supreme Court in (1964), of proving not only that Breitbart published a damaging falsehood about her but that he did so "with 'actual malice'--that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not." Even if she proves that Breitbart published false and defamatory statements about her, he wins the case if he did so only negligently.
To put it in layman's terms, she would have to demonstrate that the about her--the claim that the video showed "her federal duties are managed through the prism of race and class distinctions"--was a lie, not just an error. But Breitbart issued a timely correction of this statement, creating a strong presumption against such an allegation. (As to the video itself, Breitbart could almost certainly defend it as truthful.)
Blogger notes some other pitfalls for Sherrod of suing Breitbart--the most notable is that if the case went ahead, he would be able to use the discovery process to uncover new information about her and about his other adversaries whose conduct is relevant to the case, namely the NAACP and the Obama administration.
Of course, she hasn't actually filed a lawsuit, and our guess is that a smart lawyer will advise her against it--and that if she does sue, she will end up settling in exchange for an apology or a more emphatic correction. Her threat to sue, in short, is largely an empty one, even if one can empathize with her feeling of having been wronged by Breitbart.
But one aspect of this story strikes us as passing strange: The venue in which she issued this threat was a convention of journalists. What's more, someone who was there tells us that when she said she planned to sue, the audience applauded. Our source was careful to note that there were nonjournalists in the audience too (PR men and corporate sponsors). Still, we have to ask: What kind of journalist would applaud the threat of a defamation lawsuit?
Journalists have an institutional interest in maximizing the scope of First Amendment protections, and that means keeping it as hard as possible for plaintiffs to sue for defamation. Even meritless defamation suits against journalists and news organizations are a nuisance. Thus one would expect journalists to have a general antipathy to the idea of defamation lawsuits, even when sympathetic to a particular prospective plaintiff.
that Breitbart is not a traditional journalist, and it follows from this that he has no special claim on the sympathy of those who are. Our point, however, is that the interests of defamation plaintiffs run counter to those of journalists, regardless of whether the defendants are journalists or are doing journalism.
New York Times v. Sullivan is itself a case in point. Although the defendant was a newspaper, the published material at issue was not news but a political ad--an open letter from the Committee to Defend Martin Luther King and the Struggle for Freedom in the South, which criticized officials in Jim Crow-era Alabama for their treatment of civil rights demonstrators.
Journalists depend more on the First Amendment than just about anyone else, but we more than anyone should be cognizant that the protections we enjoy as we do our work apply to everyone, including civil rights advocates--and Andrew Breitbart.
"President Barack Obama blames the media for creating a 'phony controversy' over racial remarks by a black Agriculture Department official that were posted on the Internet. ... In an interview on ABC's daytime talk show 'The View,' Obama says the media often seek controversy, not the facts. But he acknowledged that the forced resignation of Shirley Sherrod could also be blamed on those in his administration who overreacted."--Associated Press, July29
"President Obama waded into the national race debate in an unlikely setting and with an unusual choice of words: telling daytime talk show hosts that African-Americans are 'sort of a mongrel people,'" the Hill reports:
When asked about his background, which includes a black father and white mother, Obama said of African-Americans: "We are sort of a mongrel people."
"I mean we're all kinds of mixed up," Obama said. "That's actually true of white people as well, but we just know more about it."
In November 2008 (fourth item) that some had taken offense when President-elect Obama referred (in the context of discussing his family's search for a dog) to "mutts like me." We quipped: "So what is the politically correct term? Mongrel-American?"
Of course we said this knowing that, while mutt and mongrel are synonyms with respect to dogs, the latter, unlike the former, has long had invidious connotations in the context of race. (Future , in a 1945 letter: "Rather I should die a thousand times, and see old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels.")
Obama apparently did not know this. What's more, unlike with his unquestionably inoffensive "mutt" comment of 2008, no one seems to mind, apart from . Seems to us this is evidence that the Obama presidency really is helping move America beyond race.
Illinois residents will "vote often" to fill President Obama's former Senate seat, the Associated Press reports from Chicago:
Gov. Pat Quinn filed paperwork Thursday calling a special election to fill the seat, all because of a long-running lawsuit that says it should have been done almost two years ago....
People will pick one senator to serve a six-year term in the regular election, and another to serve the final weeks of Obama's old term in a special election. The short-timer would serve from after the November election until the new senator is inaugurated in January....
Federal Judge John Grady was still sorting out on Thursday who would be on the ballot. He seemed to favor allowing candidates who qualified for the regular election by winning the February primary or being certified for the ballot after collecting 25,000 signatures.
Most handicappers regard the Republican nominee, Rep. Mark Kirk, as a slight favorite in the general election. If he wins the special election, he would likely be the Republicans' 43rd vote in a lame-duck session, making Democratic mischief less likely. (As we , the likely No.42 is Rep. Mike Castle of Delaware, favored to win a special election for Vice President Biden's former seat.)
There is one slight complication. One matter that has been the subject of lame-duck speculation is Cap'n Trade, which would tax energy much more heavily in order to combat "global warming." Last year the House barely passed a Cap'n Trade bill, , with 8 Republicans joining 211 Dems in voting "aye." Two of those Republicans were Mark Kirk and Mike Castle.
Here's the lead paragraph of a New York Times story from Washington:
Senate Republicans on Thursday rejected a bill to aid small businesses with expanded loan programs and tax breaks, in a procedural blockade that underscored how fiercely determined the party's leaders are to deny Democrats any further legislative accomplishments ahead of November's midterm elections.
But when you read the story, you find out that the GOP blocked the bill because the Democrats refused to consider amendments on topics "including the estate tax, nuclear loan guarantees, border security and the expiring Bush tax cuts":
Senator George LeMieux, Republican of Florida, who helped draft the bill, said Democrats had taken a bipartisan measure and created a partisan fight over it.
"This small-business bill should pass, and it should pass with relevant amendments," Mr. LeMieux said. "Before I am a Republican, I am a Floridian and an American, and this bill is good for our country."
With tensions running high, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, noted that "if just one" Republican had voted with the Democrats--a pointed reference to Mr. LeMieux--the bill would move forward.
Mr. LeMieux shot back, "Half the truth is no truth at all."
LeMieux has a point. The claim in the lead of the Times story that Republican leaders are "fiercely determined ... to deny Democrats any further legislative accomplishments ahead of November's midterm elections" may or may not be true, but it certainly isn't proved by anything in this story.
"If you guys think that John Kerry doesn't have enough sense of either propriety or common sense, that I'm going to be sailing my boat around Massachusetts where I'm highly recognizable but it's going to somehow stay in Rhode Island and I'm going to avoid a tax ... I'd be crazy to think that I'm going to be doing that, and that was never our long-term intention here."--the haughty, French-looking former junior senator from Massachusetts, who by the way served in Vietnam, quoted in the Boston Globe, July30
This correction appeared in yesterday's New York Post:
In Monday's editions of the New York Post, we published a story that confessed wife-killer Johnny Concepcion underwent a liver-transplant operation at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.
The hospital yesterday issued a statement that no such operation took place. The Post relied on two NYPD sources for its report, and it is now evident they were misinformed. We apologize to our readers for the error.
Prior to publishing the story, The Post sought official response from New York-Presbyterian. The Post was denied information by the hospital, which stated it could not discuss individual cases because it would be in breach of the Health Information Privacy Act (HIPA).
Curiously, the hospital now sees itself free to publicly discuss Concepcion's case.
We've got to hand it to our colleagues upstairs. The New York Times often publishes corrections that are as funny as this one, but the guys at the Post manage to do so wittingly.

"The swastika now shows up so often as a generic symbol of hatred that the Anti-Defamation League, in its annual tally of hate crimes against Jews, will no longer automatically count its appearance as an act of anti-Semitism," the New York Times reports.
ADL honcho Abe Foxman gives this example: "A year ago, there was a swastika put on Plymouth Rock. We saw it as a symbol of hatred against America, maybe against immigrants, I don't know. But to count that swastika as an anti-Semitic incident would not be accurate."
Meanwhile, the reports on an anti-Semitic incident in the outer boroughs:
Mike Grimm, a G.O.P challenger to Democrat Mike McMahon's Congressional seat, took in over $200,000 in his last filing.
But in an effort to show that Grimm lacks support among voters in the district, which covers Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, the McMahon campaign compiled a list of Jewish donors to Grimm and provided it to The Politicker.
The file, labeled "Grimm Jewish Money Q2," for the second quarter fundraising period, shows a list of over 80 names, a half-dozen of which in fact do hail from Staten Island, and a handful of others that list Brooklyn as home.
"Where is Grimm's money coming from," said Jennifer Nelson, McMahon's campaign spokeman [sic]. "There is a lot of Jewish money, a lot of money from people in Florida and Manhattan, retirees."
We first heard of this in a press release from the , whose executive director, Matthew Brooks, says: "In more than 25 years in politics I have never seen anything more despicable and offensive than this."
Just think how much embarrassment Nelson could have spared the McMahon campaign if she put a swastika on the file instead.

Full text: A crowd of about 100 demonstrators rallied inside City Hall on Thursday in support of a federal judge's temporary block of the most controversial sections of Arizona's immigration law.
The rally, which was part of a "National Day of Action" with similar demonstrations opposing the law around the country, also celebrated a recently introduced Chicago City Council resolution that calls for a symbolic boycott of Arizona businesses.
But the group -- led by immigration groups, elected officials and religious leaders -- cautioned that the fight isn't over yet.
"The architects of (Arizona SB) 1070 and other vicious, hateful laws have not gone away," said Leone Bicchieri, director of the Chicago Workers Collaborative. "They're busy regrouping."
Some see the resolution introduced Wednesday as a way to fight back.
The resolution calls for a second symbolic boycott of Arizona.
Like a similar resolution endorsed in June, the one introduced Wednesday calls for Chicago to reject business from Arizona companies and limit city employees' travel to the state.
"We need to set the example for others in the country, and I think this resolution does so," said Ald. Toni Preckwinkle, 4th, who spoke at the rally. "This country can do better than Arizona."

Full text: The incident occurred more than a year and a half ago at a polling place in Philadelphia.
"Minister King" Samir Shabazz, a leader in the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, was out front in a military-style uniform, wielding a nightstick. Jerry Jackson, a city-certified poll watcher who lived in the apartment building where voting was underway, also was in uniform and had joined Shabazz at the door. Together the two African Americans allegedly were "making intimidating statements and gestures to various individuals," according to the Justice Department.
But were they violating anyone's right to vote in the presidential election that November 2008?
The Justice Department, in the waning days of the Bush administration, filed a civil suit against the two men and the party, seeking injunctions prohibiting any such behavior in future elections. But the Obama Justice Department dropped proceedings against Jackson and the party after obtaining an injunction against Shabazz.
Conservatives maintain the case demonstrates that the Obama administration is interested in prosecuting only whites for racial activity. One prosecutor in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division abruptly resigned over what he calls Obama's "lawless hostility toward equal enforcement of the law."
But J. Gerald Hebert, who served 21 years as a senior voting rights prosecutor and supervisor at the Justice Department, noted that the polling place was in an African American neighborhood in Philadelphia -- so where was the racial component?
"You have to prove some kind of injury to somebody," Hebert said in an interview. "And they didn't station people at every polling booth in Philadelphia. They didn't block people from voting."
Nevertheless, the issue has become a point of focus for conservatives and a subject of investigations by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility and by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. When combined with the case of Shirley Sherrod, a black Agriculture Department worker in Georgia who was fired after being accused of reverse discrimination, it constitutes a shifting of traditional notions of victimhood and has inflamed perceptions among some whites that a black president is out to get them.
The federal government has seldom been confronted with the issue. In the last three decades, it has filed only three cases of alleged voter intimidation based on racial hatred. Indeed, in the 45 years since Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, fewer than 10 similar cases have even been brought to its attention.
A case similar to the Philadelphia problem was considered in 2006 when three white, anti-immigrant activists with the Minutemen organization showed up at a polling spot in Tucson. One was armed with a 9-millimeter Glock automatic on his side. He also carried a camera and clipboard -- all allegedly to scare off Latino voters.
But the Justice Department reviewed the case and declined to take action because, as in Philadelphia, no one was prevented from voting.
Republican lawmakers and conservative activists remain incensed that the Obama administration dropped the proceedings in Philadelphia.
But Justice officials say that because no one was prevented from voting, they are satisfied with the single court injunction. As Assistant Atty. Gen. Thomas E. Perez, who heads the Civil Rights Division, testified in December before a House Judiciary subcommittee: "The maximum penalty available under the relevant provision of the Voting Rights Act is injunctive relief, and that was the penalty that was obtained."
Abigail Thernstrom, a conservative who is vice chairwoman of the civil rights panel, wrote in a National Review Online article this month that the New Black Panther Party is "a lunatic fringe group that is clearly into racial theater of minor importance. It may dream of a large-scale effort to suppress voting.... But the Panthers have not realized their dream even on a small scale.
"Forget about the New Black Panther Party case," she added. "It is very small potatoes."
(Though not affiliated with the militant Black Panther Party of the 1960s, the small organization is considered a black supremacist outfit.)
Other conservatives, however, are not letting go, and the matter continues to be inflamed by Fox News, which repeatedly has aired video of a separate New Black Panther Party incident in which a member in uniform urges the death of white babies he calls "crackers."
Leading the effort on Capitol Hill is Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. "Refusal to address these concerns only confirms politicization of the issue and does not reflect well on the Justice Department," he said in a letter to Justice officials in July 2009.

Full text: Eighty demonstrators against Arizona's tough-on-illegal-immigration policies trickled out of jails here Friday, as a local sheriff continued one of his controversial operations that critics contend targets Latinos.
The protesters had been arrested Thursday, the day the state's controversial immigration law took effect and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio launched his 17th sweep against illegal immigrants.
On Friday, Arpaio announced that three illegal immigrants were arrested in the sweep. During such operations, his deputies stop people for sometimes minor violations and check their immigration status.
A federal judge had barred most of the immigration law, SB 1070, from being implemented, but that didn't stop hundreds of protesters from filling the streets and engaging in civil disobedience Thursday. Twenty-three were arrested at Arpaio's main downtown jail for blocking the entrance. Their demonstration forced the sheriff to delay his sweep for several hours.
Activists on Friday boasted that they had slowed down the tough-talking Arpaio.
"Families were not separated; the community was not terrorized," said Carlos Garcia, of civil rights group Puente, who was among those arrested outside the jail.
Friday afternoon, several activists blocked the command center Arpaio set up for his sweep, leading to more arrests for civil disobedience. "They want to go to jail, so that's where they're going," the sheriff said. "They want to keep coming, we'll lock them up."
Also Friday, Gov. Jan Brewer said the Legislature might "tweak" SB 1070 when it convenes in January to address concerns about the law raised by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton.
For example, Bolton singled out a provision requiring that every person arrested in the state be held until their immigration status is determined. Brewer's lawyer conceded that the sentence was "inartfully" written and should apply only to suspected illegal immigrants.
The state appealed Bolton's ruling Thursday, asking the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to expedite the process because of the "irreparable harm Arizona is suffering as a result of unchecked unlawful immigration."
Arizona officials hoped for a hearing in September. But late Friday the appeals court issued a two-page order rejecting the request and said the hearing would take place the week of Nov. 1.

Full text: U.S. immigration officials are exploring ways to allow certain unauthorized migrants to stay in the country legally through administrative actions rather than the logjammed legislative process, including potentially tens of thousands of students.
The ideas are detailed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials in an 11-page memo obtained and circulated this week by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa).
The memo explicitly states that deferring removal actions against an unrestricted number of illegal immigrants, allowing them to stay here legally, "would likely be controversial, not to mention expensive."
It suggested limiting that option to certain groups, such as youth who were illegally brought to the United States by their parents and now want to attend college or join the U.S. military.
In a statement this week, the immigration agency reiterated that the government did not intend to offer such remedies to the entire estimated 11.5-million illegal immigrant population.
The memo surfaced amid raging debate over illegal immigration as a federal judge this week blocked the most controversial elements of an Arizona law aimed at rooting out illegal migrants. Efforts to pass federal legislative reforms continue to falter.
In the absence of a system overhaul, the memo states, the immigration agency could use "administrative relief options to promote family unity, foster economic growth, achieve significant process improvements and reduce the threat of removal for certain individuals present in the United States without authorization."
Republicans denounced the memo as proof that the Obama administration is aiming to bypass Congress to legalize millions of illegal immigrants.
Since June, Grassley and other Republican senators have sent two letters to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano asking for a response to reports of plans for a "large-scale, de facto amnesty."
"The document provides an additional basis for our concerns that the administration will go to great lengths to circumvent Congress and unilaterally execute a backdoor amnesty plan," Grassley told the Associated Press.
Immigrant advocates, who have pressed the administration for months to use executive actions given congressional delays in pushing forward a broad immigration system overhaul, praised the memo as a creative way to bring relief to suffering migrants.
"We have in the past seen many attempts to scour the law to find justification for draconian, and ultimately unhelpful, ways to make immigrants' lives miserable," David Leopold, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. in Washington, said in a statement. "This draft document tries to think through ways to make the legal immigration system work in support of sensible law enforcement."
Thomas A. Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said activists were pleased by the memo's ideas as interim steps. But he said they prefer that efforts be focused on a broad overhaul that would, among other things, increase family visas and legalize most of the nation's undocumented migrants.
In an interview with Fox News, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs downplayed the memo and said the administration was still committed to comprehensive immigration reform passed by Congress. A Homeland Security official called the memo "the beginning of a process ... a brainstorming session."
Among other suggestions, the April memo states that officials could potentially allow 50,000 students without legal status to stay in the United States through deferred action, which involves prosecutorial discretion not to pursue removal of an illegal migrant for a set period of time. Deferred action is currently being used in such cases as allowing Haitian nationals to remain in the United States until conditions improve in their earthquake-ravaged homeland.
The memo also suggested ways to give permanent residency to thousands of migrants with temporary protected status, which allows them to stay here while their homelands are endangered by natural disasters or war. Other ideas included softening standards that now bar illegal migrants who leave the country from returning for as long as 10 years.

Abstract: Candidates across the country pining for "tea party" support have endorsed repeal of the 17th Amendment, which would end popular election of U.S. senators and return their selection to state legislatures, a step that theoretically would "restore states' rights."

Full text: If you reengage the American media after a month out of the country, as I've done this week, it's hard not to conclude that hysteria is now the dominant characteristic of our politics and civic conversation.
How else to explain the fact that questions like secession and nullification -- issues that were resolved in blood by the Civil War more than a century ago -- have come alive again and are routinely tossed around, not just by fringe figures but by Republican officeholders and candidates?
For example, Zach Wamp, a Tennessee congressman who opposes the recently enacted healthcare reforms and is running for governor, told an interviewer that he hopes "the American people will go to the ballot box in 2010 and 2012 so that states are not forced to consider separation from this government." Meanwhile, GOP candidates for statewide office in various Midwestern and Southern states are promoting the notion that states ought not to enforce any federal law not approved by at least two-thirds of their state legislators. It's as if John C. Calhoun suddenly had risen from the grave and had a talk show.
In Nevada, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate has discussed abolishing Social Security and darkly mused over whether Washington's alleged overreaching may require a "2nd Amendment solution." That means guns, a prospect that could be facilitated in one state after another by an outfit called Appleseed, which holds weekend seminars whose participants are given a mix of Minuteman pseudo-history and instruction on marksmanship.
Meanwhile, attempts to repeal sections of the Constitution continue apace. The so-called 10thers, who want to roll back 100 years of federal law and regulation in order to assert rights under the 10th Amendment, are almost unremarkably ubiquitous in the GOP. Candidates across the country pining for "tea party" support have endorsed repeal of the 17th Amendment, which would end popular election of U.S. senators and return their selection to state legislatures, a step that theoretically would "restore states' rights."
The most popular such movement involves abolishing or gutting the 10th Amendment as a way to deny American citizenship to the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. Even the ostensibly moderate Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has signed on to that one, while Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) speculates that such children actually are terrorist moles planted here to grow up as U.S. citizens as part of a long-range plot.
Nothing quite tops the anti-Muslim hysteria, which has led people to organize opposition to the construction of new mosques in places from Lower Manhattan to Temecula. One candidate for statewide office in Tennessee -- somebody should examine their water supply -- argues that the 1st Amendment does not cover Muslims.
Some inclined toward therapeutic explanations of history might attribute all this to a kind of collective post-traumatic stress syndrome engendered by the aftermath of the horrific events of 9/11. Others might point to the dislocating effect of electing an African American president to govern a society in which strong currents of racial anxiety still eddy beneath the surface of everyday life. Perhaps both forces act in unseen concert.
Back in the early 1970s -- an era whose tumult we yet may come to regard as benign -- social scientists here and in Britain coined the term "moral panic" to describe what can happen when groups of people are seized by an exaggerated fear that other people or communal forces threaten their values or way of life. The scholars described those who promoted the panic's spread as "moral entrepreneurs" -- a term that takes on a deep resonance when you consider the commentators and politicians who have attached themselves, and their interests, to the "tea party" and its attendant movements.
In the midst of moral panic, inchoate indignation stands in for reason; accusation and denunciation supplant dialogue and argument; history and facts are rendered malleable, merely adjuncts of the moral entrepreneur's -- or should we say provocateur's -- rhetorical will. As we now also see, a self-interested mass media with an economic stake in the theatricality of raised and angry voices can transmit moral panic like a pathogen.
Looking around the United States in the summer of 2010, hysterical moral panic seems an apt description of our fevered political condition.

Full text: Several years ago, Justice Department lawyer Edwin S. Kneedler argued his 100th case before the U.S. Supreme Court, a benchmark shared by fewer than 10 attorneys in U.S. history.
In a rare departure from court routine, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. congratulated Kneedler from the bench. Kneedler quietly thanked him, said he was honored and walked away, according to lawyers who were there.
Now, Kneedler is bringing the same subdued style to a case that has attracted loud political voices from all sides: the Obama administration's lawsuit over Arizona's new immigration law. As the government's lead attorney, the deputy solicitor general must fight a law that President Obama has strongly condemned while not alienating Arizonans who fervently support it, all in the context of a national struggle over the divisive issue of immigration.
Kneedler has won the first battle: A federal judge in Arizona this week granted his request for a preliminary injunction blocking the most controversial portions of the law, which allows police to question those they suspect of being illegal immigrants. Arizona has appealed, and on Friday night an appellate court set arguments for November, rejecting a state request for an expedited hearing.
Friends and former colleagues of Kneedler, who declined to comment Friday, have described him as the quintessential government lawyer, a 35-year Justice Department veteran with an encyclopedic memory. He is known for burying his head in legal papers, documents that he transports in a weathered black satchel from his Washington home to his office.
Kneedler, 64, has been in the solicitor general's office, the government's advocate before the Supreme Court, since the Carter administration. He is no stranger to politically charged cases: More than a decade ago, he argued the government's position on whether young Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez should be sent home to his father, and he worked on briefs about whether Paula Jones's sexual harassment case against President Bill Clinton should proceed with Clinton in office.
In recent years, Kneedler has been involved in other legal controversies, including the question of where terror suspects should be tried and whether white firefighters in New Haven, Conn., were unfairly denied promotions because of their race -- an issue in last year's confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
Kneedler is widely described as apolitical. His first government boss, when he joined the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in 1975, was Antonin Scalia, the future conservative Supreme Court justice.
In the insular world of Washington Supreme Court advocates, few are willing to criticize colleagues. But former deputy solicitor general Lawrence G. Wallace, who helped hire Kneedler into the solicitor general's office in 1979, said Kneedler did make some enemies in the government over the years.
Wallace said Kneedler did not hesitate to argue with high-level political appointees from across the government who were trying to force a particular legal outcome.
"He was sometimes regarded as an obstacle by people who were trying to accomplish certain policy objectives that the law would not support," Wallace said. "Neither of us were always popular with some people in some administrations."
Some lawyers said Kneedler's apolitical reputation made him a savvy choice for the high-profile Arizona immigration case, even though it is unusual for a top official in the solicitor general's office to argue before a U.S. district judge. Kneedler is the senior career deputy -- there are four deputies in all -- and he served as acting solicitor general for several months in 2009 before Elena Kagan was confirmed as solicitor general.
"The Justice Department wanted to show they were taking this case incredibly seriously, but didn't want to send Obama's guy," said Tom Goldstein, a Washington lawyer who founded the Scotusblog Web site. "I've never seen any hint of politics in Kneedler. There really isn't a more respected advocate in the Supreme Court bar.''
At this week's hearing in Phoenix before U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton, Kneedler shook hands and chatted with Arizona's lead attorney, John J. Bouma. He then fielded pointed questions from Bolton, never raising his voice and consistently holding to his argument that the Arizona law intrudes on federal immigration enforcement.
"He's tremendous on his feet during oral argument," said Patricia A. Millett, a Washington lawyer who worked with Kneedler in the solicitor general's office for 11 years. She described Kneedler as "an incredibly hard worker" who often stays at his Justice Department office into the night and works weekends.
Kneedler, a University of Virginia Law School graduate, is married with two daughters. Unlike many colleagues who left public service to make more money in private practice, friends said he stayed because he loves his job.
That longevity means Kneedler has now argued 109 cases before the Supreme Court, 32 more than any other active lawyer, according to the court clerk's office. Wallace, who holds the 20th-century record with 157, said he is not worried about Kneedler one day eclipsing his mark.
"Records are made to be broken," said Wallace, who retired in 2003. "Ed is an extraordinary lawyer.''

Full text: Rod Blagowho?
Nobody was going to miss the final stages of former Rod Blagojevich's corruption trial this week, but that didn't stop some local politicians from borrowing some of the former gov's newspaper ink. Check out some of the state's noteworthy -- and Blago-free! -- political news of the week, as reported by the Tribune.
Mayor dodges bat
Poor Mayor Daley -- the man can't even watch his beloved White Sox without someone taking a shot at him. During a game Wednesday at U.S. Cellular Field, the mayor was forced to duck out of the way of a flying bat when left fielder Andruw Jones lost his grip on the lumber. Nobody was hurt, and as far as we know, it was an accident. Right, Andruw?
Airports get boozier
Chicago has two new spots for you to get your liquor fix -- even if that craving for a glass of merlot strikes at 5 a.m. The City Council on Wednesday approved around-the-clock alcohol sales at O'Hare and Midway, allowing beer and wine to be sold from pushcarts throughout airport terminals. That calls for a toast!
Jackson Jr. is handsome
Jesse Jackson Jr., the 45-year-old Democratic Congressman from Chicago, wasn't just on the 50 Most Beautiful People list released by The Hill -- he was No. 9 on the Washington, D.C., newspaper's ranking of lookers in the nation's capital. "What's next?" Jackson asked the paper. "GQ?"

Some people in Chicago probably are, like, totally bummed about this week's news from Springfield. Gov. Quinn signed into law a measure that will ban the sale of a synthetic marijuana substitute often known as K2. The product will be treated as a controlled substance starting Jan. 1.

That's how many iPads -- at a total cost of about $335,300 -- Chicago State University is considering purchasing for full-time freshmen and faculty, the Tribune reports. Students who leave before completing their junior years would have to return the Apple devices, while students who complete their junior years would get to keep them. The university is expected to make its decision next week.

Abstract: Adding fuel to the bonfire, Texas Republicans recently adopted an over-the-top platform at their state convention that, among other things, encouraged the Legislature to create a Class A misdemeanor criminal offense "for an illegal alien to intentionally or knowingly be within the state of Texas," and to "oppose amnesty in any form leading to citizenship."

Full text: Parents, you know how it is with kids. One acts up, and so you have to focus your attention on the troublemaker and take your eye off the others. Then, when you're not looking, another one gets out of line.
States are much the same way. The eyes of the nation are fixed on Arizona, the undisputed problem child in our national immigration debate. But there are other states where lawmakers are eager to follow Arizona's lead and blame Washington for not solving a problem that, in truth, their own residents (i.e., employers) helped create.
At least half a dozen of the states thinking about going on this suicide run can perhaps be forgiven their ignorance because the experience of having a sizable population of illegal immigrants is new to them. In Utah, Georgia, Ohio, Maryland, Oklahoma and South Carolina, illegal immigrants are still a rather exotic import.
But then there's Texas, which used to be part of Mexico and where lenient immigration policies toward white settlers from the South and Northeast led to a famous tenant dispute that included a dustup at the Alamo in 1836. In Tejas, Latinos are indigenous and as ubiquitous as bluebonnets. In the Lone Star State, where my mother and grandparents and great-grandparents were born and raised and where I spent five years writing about immigration and other issues for the Dallas Morning News, legislators should know better than to even flirt with the idea of adopting a divisive and dangerous law like the one in Arizona.
This was true even before U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton, in defense of the Constitution, ripped the guts out of the Arizona law by striking down its most egregious and indefensible parts. Bolton had her pick of seven lawsuits seeking to block the law's implementation, and she based her ruling on the lawsuit filed by the Obama administration. The Justice Department argued that Arizona had exceeded its authority and trampled on powers reserved for the federal government.
Bolton agreed. She was particularly bothered by those elements of the law that all but required racial profiling by forcing police officers to arrest people they suspect are in the country illegally, made it a state crime for the undocumented to seek work, required legal immigrants to carry papers proving their status, and allowed police to detain and arrest people who could not prove their legal status. So the judge issued a preliminary injunction against those parts. The rest of the law -- which did things such as making it a state crime to transport illegal immigrants -- was allowed to go into effect.
So much for Gov. Jan Brewer's bravado in telling the federal government that Arizona would "meet you in court." This battle is far from over, and the issue is probably headed to the Supreme Court. So far, it's Common Sense, 1, Arizona, 0.
But like the saying goes, common sense isn't always common -- even in Texas. State Rep. Leo Berman, a Republican, is drafting an Arizona-style bill for Texas and plans to introduce it next session.
Adding fuel to the bonfire, Texas Republicans recently adopted an over-the-top platform at their state convention that, among other things, encouraged the Legislature to create a Class A misdemeanor criminal offense "for an illegal alien to intentionally or knowingly be within the state of Texas," and to "oppose amnesty in any form leading to citizenship." Texas Republicans also want to deny citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, ban day-labor work centers, limit bilingual education to three years, and deny non-U.S. citizens access to state or federal financial assistance for college.
In Texas, Latinos are forecast to make up nearly 80 percent of the population growth over the next 30 years (compared with only 4 percent for whites), and Latinos could outnumber whites by 2015, the San Antonio Express-News reported last month. What the Texas GOP drafted was a pact with the devil.
All of which leads me to ask my friends in the Lone Star State the same question my mom used to ask me growing up: "If all the other kids jumped off a cliff, would you do the same?"
Apparently they would.

Cross Country: Young Illegals Out Themselves, Daring To Be Deported

Abstract: Pictures of these students protesting with impunity are already making an impression on students of illegal status from coast to coast, spreading the movement with the aid of social networking websites. The protests this month are most significant not because of any direct influence they may have on lawmakers, but because they are drawing other young people with illegal status out into the open, undoing the chilling effect that legal vulnerability has long had on illegal immigrants' political activism.

Full text: On July 20, 22 young illegal immigrants in caps and gowns entered the Hart Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C., and began sit-ins in the offices of several senators. Twelve soon returned to the atrium, where they formed a circle around a banner reading "Undocumented and Unafraid." Refusing to be moved, the students were arrested by Capitol Police, as were nine others who had stayed put in the offices of Sen. John McCain and Majority Leader Harry Reid.
Less than two miles away, a similar protest by a separate but allied group was taking place at Lafayette Square in front of the White House. These students went a step further. Openly announcing their immigration status and giving their full names just across the Mall from Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters, they forced a difficult choice upon ICE officials.
Take no action, and ICE would undermine the law. But come down hard by deporting the students, many of them still teenagers, and it would risk drawing overwhelming public outcry.
These individuals -- plus several hundred more high school and college students of illegal status -- had come to the capital to call for passage of the floundering Dream Act. Dream, the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, co-sponsored by 36 senators, including Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) and Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), would offer temporary residency to students who arrived in the U.S. illegally as minors if they attend college. It would grant them permanent residency upon graduating.
Young people have come to the capital every year since 2001 to demonstrate in support of the act. But many senators suggest that the bill remains five votes short of the 60 needed for cloture, and it has slim prospects of being passed during this session of Congress. So in order to draw greater attention to their cause, affected students decided to undertake a risky form of civil disobedience. If arrested, they faced deportation.
Yet ICE has stated that it has no intention of initiating deportation proceedings against the students arrested in the Washington protests. The officials likely wanted to avoid a repeat of what happened last month with a Harvard student named Eric Balderas.
Mr. Balderas had deportation proceedings opened against him after authorities discovered his status as he was passing through security at an airport. The case attracted widespread media attention and international backlash. Harvard administrators stated their support for Mr. Balderas, whose case was soon taken up by Mr. Durbin. After less than two weeks, ICE backed down, halting Mr. Balderas's deportation indefinitely.
Hoping the sit-in will fade from the public view, ICE is sticking to the safe line that the students' actions in Washington simply "illustrate the need for comprehensive immigration reform," as spokesperson Gillian Brigham told me.
Yet this strikes many on Capitol Hill as an inexcusable failure to enforce the law. "It's outrageous," California Rep. Gary Miller told the Orange County Register. "How can you have a protest right in a U.S. senator's office, admit you are here illegally in violation of the law, and we pat you on the back and do nothing?"
But even doing nothing stands to strengthen the "Dreamers." Pictures of these students protesting with impunity are already making an impression on students of illegal status from coast to coast, spreading the movement with the aid of social networking websites.
With that momentum, the activists intend to maintain a continuous presence in the capital. One organizer, Mo Abdollahi, who was brought to America illegally from Iran as a child, told me that the protests will go on "as long as it takes" for Dream to pass. At the same time, Mr. Abdollahi disputes the notion that these actions are deliberate provocations in the mold of Gandhi or King. He says that the Dreamers are "just trying to live [their] lives." If that means deportation, he says, it is a price they are willing to pay.
Is their goal to force another public deportation crisis like that of Eric Balderas? "We are not deliberately trying to do that," he claims. If the students' civil disobedience brings the force of the law down upon them, he says, that is simply a hazard of their activism. Other student leaders told me that there is more calculation behind the actions in Washington. But whether these activists are naive or calculating, their effectiveness is impossible to dispute.
The protests this month are most significant not because of any direct influence they may have on lawmakers, but because they are drawing other young people with illegal status out into the open, undoing the chilling effect that legal vulnerability has long had on illegal immigrants' political activism. As the fall elections near, such activism will likely serve as another flash point for an already volatile issue.

Full text: Lawmakers were at odds over how to punish Rangel.
In a setback for Democrats, negotiations between members of the House ethics committee have so far failed to reach an agreement to settle charges against the New York lawmaker. The standstill makes it increasingly likely that Democrats will face a politically embarrassing public ethics trial for one of their party's most senior members in the months before the November elections.
A growing number of the most vulnerable Democratic lawmakers have begun calling on Rangel to resign from Congress.

House Votes to Overhaul
System of Offshore Drilling
The House voted Friday to overhaul the system of offshore drilling, responding to the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history by creating new safeguards and eliminating a cap on damages companies must pay.
The 209-193 vote came more than three months after a BP PLC oil well blowout that killed 11 workers and dumped tens of millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. In the Senate, it is unclear whether Democrats have the votes to move forward.
