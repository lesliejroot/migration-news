a possible PAA collab with Monica

notes on downloading:
Initial search is saved here (Leslie has to log in to access):https://search.proquest.com/search/1269624?accountid=14496
Initial search yielded 9,870 articles. However, ProQuest only shows you the first 4k results of a given search (I had them sorted oldest-newest), so after downloading the first 4k I re-specified the search to start at the date I had left off on; I did this again when I got to 8000 articles. This changed the number of articles slightly, and we end with 9,689 (note that a few of the files labeled as containing 1000 articles actually contain 997-999 - I'm not sure exactly why, but sometimes an article would appear as a duplicate and then disappear, gonna chalk it up to database weirdness).

.txt files contain full text; .xls files do not, but they contain useful metadata in an easier-to-use form. Article ID given in .txt file matches ID number in column 3 of Excel file, and the articles are also in the same order in both files.
