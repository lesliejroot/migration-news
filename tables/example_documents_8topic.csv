In Zimbabwe, President Robert Mugabe has turned democracy into personal rule, ruining his country in the process. In Pakistan, democracy largely provides a facade for military rule, even if President Pervez Musharraf has now put aside his uniform. Most worryingly, perhaps, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has used populist support in a pluralist system to push Iran into a hazardous foreign policy, though he does remain formally subordinate to the ''supreme leader,'' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mercifully, what happened in Germany in 1933, and its aftermath, will remain a uniquely terrible episode in history. What took place then reminds us even so of the illusory assumption that democracy will always be a favored choice of a population torn apart by war, facing enormous privations and burning with resentment at national humiliation through perceived foreign interference. It also reminds us -- if such a reminder is necessary -- of the need for international cooperation to restrain potential ''mad dogs'' in world politics before they are dangerous enough to bite.","Democracy , Dictators , Nazi era , Germany , Zimbabwe , Russia , Hitler, Adolf (1889-1945) , Chavez, Hugo , Putin, Vladimir"

Despite Trump's bullying, false proclamations, poorly executed orders and now personal attacks on federal judges, Republican leaders have yet to display any meaningful disapproval.

A few years ago, Henry Paulson, who served as Treasury secretary in Republican George W.

The press secretary also declined to answer a straightforward question about the unemployment rate, suggesting that the number will henceforth be whatever the Trump administration wants it to be. In a stunning demonstration of the power and resiliency of our new post-factual political culture, Mr. Trump and his allies in the right media have already turned the term ""fake news"" against its critics, essentially draining it of any meaning. Erroneous reports that the bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office or misleading reports that sanctions against Russia had been lifted will be seized on by Mr. Trump's White House to reinforce his indictment. The relationship appears to be symbiotic, as Mr. Trump often seems to pick up on talking points from Fox News and has tweeted out links from websites notorious for their casual relationship to the truth, including sites like Gateway Pundit, a hoax-peddling site that announced, shortly after the inauguration, that it would have a White House correspondent.

ICE has made arrests in courthouses before, but the tactic drew rebukes in California after a series of raids led to the capture of women seeking restraining orders, people paying parking tickets and even one couple getting married inside a Kern County courthouse in 2013, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Last week, Denver City Atty. Kristin Bronson also told several media outlets that she had to dismiss prosecutions against four domestic violence suspects because the complaining witnesses, all of whom are in the country illegally, were afraid ICE might learn their location through a court docket or send agents to the courthouse when they appeared to testify. Some law enforcement leaders in California and throughout the country have repeatedly expressed concern that Trump's promise to dramatically expand immigration enforcement will erode trust between minority communities and local police departments, a bond already weakened by years of scrutiny over officers' use of force throughout the country. ICE faced renewed scrutiny last month after the agency released a video showing immigration agents identifying themselves as police, a tactic decried by activists as unethical and police leaders as detrimental to local law enforcement's relationship with immigrant communities.","Immigration policy , Deportation , Activists , Law enforcement , Public safety , Restraining orders , Convictions , Women , Sex crimes , Courthouses , Aliens , Texas , John F.

In October, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll said seven in 10 Republicans felt ""uneasy and out of place"" in their own country because of illegal immigration, the declining role of religion in everyday life and broader acceptance of gay and lesbian rights.","Primaries & caucuses , Candidates , Congressional elections -- Ohio , Political campaigns , Ohio , United States--US , Boehner, John"

Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, matched Senator John McCain in attracting voters who identified themselves as moderate and took the vast majority of those who identified themselves as conservative. Mr. McCain surprised many by making a campaign stop in Boston on Sunday, where he watched the Super Bowl in a hotel lobby. Polls showed the contest tightening, and Mr. McCain told audiences that he believed he had a chance of winning the state's 43 delegates. Mr. Mc- Cain won the primary in 2000, defeating George W. Bush by nearly two to one. But Mr. Romney dismissed the 11th hour visit by Mr. Mc- Cain, saying, ''I've got a lot of friends there.'' Many observers had said that if Mr. Romney lost his home state, it would signal the end of the campaign. Although state officials had said they expected a record turnout, rain throughout the day seemed to temper that. Mr. McCain's effort to court conservative Republicans helped him win in Illinois, where nearly 4 in 10 primary voters who described themselves as conservatives said they had voted for him, according to early exit polls. Mr. Romney, who had argued that a vote for Mr. McCain represented an abandonment of the party's conservative principles, won slightly fewer votes among conservatives, the exit polls showed. Earlier polls had shown Mr. McCain with a strong lead in Illinois, a state with an open primary and 70 delegates at stake. As was the case elsewhere, Republican primary voters polled here were far less concerned about immigration than about the economy. Although Mr. Romney argued that his business career better prepared him to manage the nation's fiscal matters, voters who cited the economy as their major concern chose Mr. Mc- Cain. Overwhelmingly, voters surveyed in Illinois said that Mr. McCain was more qualified than any of his competitors to be commander in chief.","Presidential elections , Political campaigns , Primaries & caucuses , Romney, W Mitt , McCain, John , Huckabee, Mike"
