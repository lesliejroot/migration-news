Just as Mr. [Dan Zanes] was once the lead singer for a 1980s rock band called the Del Fuegos, Mr. Rhoden' had a musical career with an even more unexpected first act. During the 1980s and '90s Father Goose was known as Rankin Don, a hardcore dancehall rapper (or ''D.J.'' in reggae parlance) from Brooklyn. His best-known release was the 12-inch single ''Baddest D.J.,'' a brazen declaration of lyrical superiority punctuated with gun-slinging hyperbole: ''The 16 'pon me back, the Desert Eagle 'pon me hip.'' Perhaps the most striking aspect of Mr. Rhoden's album is the way it reconnects dancehall with its roots in songs like ''Chi Chi Budoo'' and ''Long Time Gal,'' which were first popularized by the folklorist and poet Louise Bennett, a Jamaican national hero better known as Miss Lou. Even as late as 1980 Jamaican dancehall pioneers Michigan &amp; Smiley adapted one of their biggest hits, ''Rub a Dub Style,'' from the nursery rhyme ''Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary.'' Such innocent themes eventually fell out of favor in the dancehall, but as Mr. Rhoden said, ''Sometimes you have to go back to go forward.'' Mr. Rhoden said of his second career: ''To be honest, I didn't expect any of this. Just to see so many people embracing it with so much love is unbelievable.'' Now Father Goose has begun rehearsing his own reggae band and making plans for a tour. And as for his show with Dan Zanes &amp; Friends at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, suffice it to say that Father Goose has invited a few friends. ''It's going be one big party,'' he said. ''Everybody knows I'm the one that normally get the party started. My party started in Jamaica, and everywhere I go there's a party. And the party doesn't stop.''","Rap music , Musicians & conductors , Childrens music , Rhoden, Wayne (Father Goose)"

The band recently returned from the Womex world music festival in Seville, Spain, where it was one of a handful of acts to play showcase performances. British publications have included it in ''next big thing'' roundups, and Dengue Fever's songs have been on television and film soundtracks, including Jim Jarmusch's ''Broken Flowers.'' A new documentary, ''Sleepwalking Through the Mekong,'' that follows the group on its first trip as a band to Cambodia, seems likely to gain it further notice. (It plays the Mercury Lounge on the Lower East Side on March 4, and at Southpaw in Brooklyn on March 5.) Dmitri Vietze, a publicist and marketer for many global music acts, sees the band as ''part of a larger developmental pattern'' in world music. ''Can you stick them in the world-music bin at brick and mortar retail stores?'' Mr. Vietze asked. ''I don't know. But as far as how they fit into world music in a larger philosophical context, they are a part of a huge and promising future.'' He noted that the American market had been introduced to world sounds most often by American artists who love and emulate them, like Paul Simon. Now, he said, he sees a movement toward music made and influenced by emigres: ''We're seeing more and more bands like Dengue Fever.'' Older generations of Cambodians in California are sometimes critical. ''They don't want me to show off too much of my dress,'' she said. ''They always tell me, 'Don't forget you're a Cambodian girl.'&lt;0&gt;'' But the younger generation responds to Dengue Fever and even breakdances to its reinvention of a mongrel music that is itself a reinvention of a mongrel music from the West.","Popular music , World music , Musical performances , Personal profiles , Chhom Nimol"

ICE has made arrests in courthouses before, but the tactic drew rebukes in California after a series of raids led to the capture of women seeking restraining orders, people paying parking tickets and even one couple getting married inside a Kern County courthouse in 2013, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Last week, Denver City Atty. Kristin Bronson also told several media outlets that she had to dismiss prosecutions against four domestic violence suspects because the complaining witnesses, all of whom are in the country illegally, were afraid ICE might learn their location through a court docket or send agents to the courthouse when they appeared to testify. Some law enforcement leaders in California and throughout the country have repeatedly expressed concern that Trump's promise to dramatically expand immigration enforcement will erode trust between minority communities and local police departments, a bond already weakened by years of scrutiny over officers' use of force throughout the country. ICE faced renewed scrutiny last month after the agency released a video showing immigration agents identifying themselves as police, a tactic decried by activists as unethical and police leaders as detrimental to local law enforcement's relationship with immigrant communities.","Immigration policy , Deportation , Activists , Law enforcement , Public safety , Restraining orders , Convictions , Women , Sex crimes , Courthouses , Aliens , Texas , John F.

The use of the tactic, critics said, is particularly egregious in heavily immigrant cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, where police and elected officials have tried for decades to distinguish their cops from federal immigration agents in an effort to convince immigrants living illegally in their cities that they can interact with local police without fear of deportation. ""There is something fundamentally unfair about ICE exploiting local and state policies that are trying to improve public safety by promoting immigrants' trust in law enforcement,"" said Frances Miriam Kreimer, senior attorney at Dolores Street Community Services in San Francisco.

Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, matched Senator John McCain in attracting voters who identified themselves as moderate and took the vast majority of those who identified themselves as conservative. Mr. McCain surprised many by making a campaign stop in Boston on Sunday, where he watched the Super Bowl in a hotel lobby. Polls showed the contest tightening, and Mr. McCain told audiences that he believed he had a chance of winning the state's 43 delegates. Mr. Mc- Cain won the primary in 2000, defeating George W. Bush by nearly two to one. But Mr. Romney dismissed the 11th hour visit by Mr. Mc- Cain, saying, ''I've got a lot of friends there.'' Many observers had said that if Mr. Romney lost his home state, it would signal the end of the campaign. Although state officials had said they expected a record turnout, rain throughout the day seemed to temper that. Mr. McCain's effort to court conservative Republicans helped him win in Illinois, where nearly 4 in 10 primary voters who described themselves as conservatives said they had voted for him, according to early exit polls. Mr. Romney, who had argued that a vote for Mr. McCain represented an abandonment of the party's conservative principles, won slightly fewer votes among conservatives, the exit polls showed. Earlier polls had shown Mr. McCain with a strong lead in Illinois, a state with an open primary and 70 delegates at stake. As was the case elsewhere, Republican primary voters polled here were far less concerned about immigration than about the economy. Although Mr. Romney argued that his business career better prepared him to manage the nation's fiscal matters, voters who cited the economy as their major concern chose Mr. Mc- Cain. Overwhelmingly, voters surveyed in Illinois said that Mr. McCain was more qualified than any of his competitors to be commander in chief.","Presidential elections , Political campaigns , Primaries & caucuses , Romney, W Mitt , McCain, John , Huckabee, Mike"
