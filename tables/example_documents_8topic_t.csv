Piscopo's possible bid reflects the maneuvering in New Jersey and Virginia - the two states with gubernatorial contests this year - by candidates from both parties, who are trying to capitalize on lessons learned from Trump's strong performance among working-class voters. Several Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia have taken on the mantle of issues championed by Sanders, such as raising the minimum wage to $15, making public colleges and universities free, and moving to a single-payer health-care system. Despite sagging job approval numbers nationally, Trump remains popular among the Republican base, so there's an incentive, analysts say, to play up similarities during competitive GOP primaries. New Jersey Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno (R), who is seeking to succeed Christie, made no mention of Trump during a forum here hosted by a commercial real estate development association.

The White House took several steps in its revised order to address those due process concerns, and as a result the latest legal fight has focused on whether the travel ban violated the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from disfavoring particular religions. The appeal would go back to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , the same court that dealt the final blow to Mr. Trump's original executive order.

The use of the tactic, critics said, is particularly egregious in heavily immigrant cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, where police and elected officials have tried for decades to distinguish their cops from federal immigration agents in an effort to convince immigrants living illegally in their cities that they can interact with local police without fear of deportation. ""There is something fundamentally unfair about ICE exploiting local and state policies that are trying to improve public safety by promoting immigrants' trust in law enforcement,"" said Frances Miriam Kreimer, senior attorney at Dolores Street Community Services in San Francisco. In one case, ICE agents in Los Angeles identified themselves as police detectives to the mother of Luis Enrique Cruz Estrada, saying her son had information regarding the whereabouts of a person they wanted to find, according to attorney Jennie Pasquarella, director of immigrants' rights for the American Civil Liberties Union of California.

Kristin Bronson also told several media outlets that she had to dismiss prosecutions against four domestic violence suspects because the complaining witnesses, all of whom are in the country illegally, were afraid ICE might learn their location through a court docket or send agents to the courthouse when they appeared to testify.Some law enforcement leaders in California and throughout the country have repeatedly expressed concern that Trump's promise to dramatically expand immigration enforcement will erode trust between minority communities and local police departments, a bond already weakened by years of scrutiny over officers' use of force throughout the country.ICE faced renewed scrutiny last month after the agency released a video showing immigration agents identifying themselves as police, a tactic decried by activists as unethical and police leaders as detrimental to local law enforcement's relationship with immigrant communities.","Immigration policy , Deportation , Activists , Law enforcement , Public safety , Restraining orders , Convictions , Women , Sex crimes , Courthouses , Aliens , Texas , John F.
