The band recently returned from the Womex world music festival in Seville, Spain, where it was one of a handful of acts to play showcase performances. British publications have included it in ''next big thing'' roundups, and Dengue Fever's songs have been on television and film soundtracks, including Jim Jarmusch's ''Broken Flowers.'' A new documentary, ''Sleepwalking Through the Mekong,'' that follows the group on its first trip as a band to Cambodia, seems likely to gain it further notice. (It plays the Mercury Lounge on the Lower East Side on March 4, and at Southpaw in Brooklyn on March 5.) Dmitri Vietze, a publicist and marketer for many global music acts, sees the band as ''part of a larger developmental pattern'' in world music. ''Can you stick them in the world-music bin at brick and mortar retail stores?'' Mr. Vietze asked. ''I don't know. But as far as how they fit into world music in a larger philosophical context, they are a part of a huge and promising future.'' He noted that the American market had been introduced to world sounds most often by American artists who love and emulate them, like Paul Simon. Now, he said, he sees a movement toward music made and influenced by emigres: ''We're seeing more and more bands like Dengue Fever.'' Older generations of Cambodians in California are sometimes critical. ''They don't want me to show off too much of my dress,'' she said. ''They always tell me, 'Don't forget you're a Cambodian girl.'&lt;0&gt;'' But the younger generation responds to Dengue Fever and even breakdances to its reinvention of a mongrel music that is itself a reinvention of a mongrel music from the West.","Popular music , World music , Musical performances , Personal profiles , Chhom Nimol"

Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, matched Senator John McCain in attracting voters who identified themselves as moderate and took the vast majority of those who identified themselves as conservative. Mr. McCain surprised many by making a campaign stop in Boston on Sunday, where he watched the Super Bowl in a hotel lobby. Polls showed the contest tightening, and Mr. McCain told audiences that he believed he had a chance of winning the state's 43 delegates. Mr. Mc- Cain won the primary in 2000, defeating George W. Bush by nearly two to one. But Mr. Romney dismissed the 11th hour visit by Mr. Mc- Cain, saying, ''I've got a lot of friends there.'' Many observers had said that if Mr. Romney lost his home state, it would signal the end of the campaign. Although state officials had said they expected a record turnout, rain throughout the day seemed to temper that. Mr. McCain's effort to court conservative Republicans helped him win in Illinois, where nearly 4 in 10 primary voters who described themselves as conservatives said they had voted for him, according to early exit polls. Mr. Romney, who had argued that a vote for Mr. McCain represented an abandonment of the party's conservative principles, won slightly fewer votes among conservatives, the exit polls showed. Earlier polls had shown Mr. McCain with a strong lead in Illinois, a state with an open primary and 70 delegates at stake. As was the case elsewhere, Republican primary voters polled here were far less concerned about immigration than about the economy. Although Mr. Romney argued that his business career better prepared him to manage the nation's fiscal matters, voters who cited the economy as their major concern chose Mr. Mc- Cain. Overwhelmingly, voters surveyed in Illinois said that Mr. McCain was more qualified than any of his competitors to be commander in chief.","Presidential elections , Political campaigns , Primaries & caucuses , Romney, W Mitt , McCain, John , Huckabee, Mike"
